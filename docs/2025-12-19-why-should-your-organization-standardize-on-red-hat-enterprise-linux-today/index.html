The content is fresh in my mind, and I wanted to share some of it with you in advance, as I believe it contains compelling insights. As you likely know, we launched numerous new features and capabilities this year with RHEL 10 , including image mode for RHEL , which enables users to create and manage operating system images for consistent deployment, and the RHEL command-line assistant powered by Lightspeed, which uses generative AI to help users execute complex command-line tasks. We also announced the inclusion of post-quantum encryption algorithms to help your organization resist future security attacks. More recently, with the launch of RHEL 10.1 and 9.7 , we included support for AI accelerators via our repositories, and also introduced a RHEL offline command-line assistant in dev preview , along with RHEL HPC for Azure. Furthermore, just a few weeks ago, we announced the Red Hat Project Hummingbird. These innovative features, capabilities, and key announcements—spanning consistency, AI integration, advanced security, and high-performance computing—reinforce RHEL’s position as the leading enterprise Linux platform. They are a compelling reason to standardize your infrastructure on RHEL, ensuring you are equipped with a consistent, secure, and modern operating system foundation ready for the future of IT. We have many more exciting developments planned for 2026, so stay tuned and make sure you check out the links above in case you missed any of these significant announcements. In this blog, I want to discuss how standardizing on RHEL across your entire infrastructure will help solve many critical organizational challenges and the specific business outcomes it will deliver. Standardizing on RHEL refers to adopting a uniform approach to using RHEL across your organization. It involves selecting RHEL and implementing it consistently across all systems."><meta property="og:url" content="https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-12-19-why-should-your-organization-standardize-on-red-hat-enterprise-linux-today/"><meta property="og:site_name" content="Kubermates"><meta property="og:title" content="Why should your organization standardize on Red Hat Enterprise Linux today?"><meta property="og:description" content="Why should your organization standardize on Red Hat Enterprise Linux today?

The content is fresh in my mind, and I wanted to share some of it with you in advance, as I believe it contains compelling insights. As you likely know, we launched numerous new features and capabilities this year with RHEL 10 , including image mode for RHEL , which enables users to create and manage operating system images for consistent deployment, and the RHEL command-line assistant powered by Lightspeed, which uses generative AI to help users execute complex command-line tasks. We also announced the inclusion of post-quantum encryption algorithms to help your organization resist future security attacks. More recently, with the launch of RHEL 10.1 and 9.7 , we included support for AI accelerators via our repositories, and also introduced a RHEL offline command-line assistant in dev preview , along with RHEL HPC for Azure. Furthermore, just a few weeks ago, we announced the Red Hat Project Hummingbird. These innovative features, capabilities, and key announcements—spanning consistency, AI integration, advanced security, and high-performance computing—reinforce RHEL's position as the leading enterprise Linux platform. They are a compelling reason to standardize your infrastructure on RHEL, ensuring you are equipped with a consistent, secure, and modern operating system foundation ready for the future of IT. We have many more exciting developments planned for 2026, so stay tuned and make sure you check out the links above in case you missed any of these significant announcements. In this blog, I want to discuss how standardizing on RHEL across your entire infrastructure will help solve many critical organizational challenges and the specific business outcomes it will deliver. Standardizing on RHEL refers to adopting a uniform approach to using RHEL across your organization. It involves selecting RHEL and implementing it consistently across all systems.</p></div></div></section><div class=td-content><p>Open the original post ↗ <a href=https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/why-should-your-organization-standardize-red-hat-enterprise-linux-today>https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/why-should-your-organization-standardize-red-hat-enterprise-linux-today</a></p></div><footer class="mt-4 pt-3 border-top d-flex flex-wrap gap-2 align-items-center"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-sm" href=https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/why-should-your-organization-standardize-red-hat-enterprise-linux-today target=_blank rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Open
