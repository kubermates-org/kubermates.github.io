How do I get involved? Swap is a fundamental and an invaluable Linux feature. It offers numerous benefits, such as effectively increasing a node’s memory by swapping out unused data, shielding nodes from system-level memory spikes, preventing Pods from crashing when they hit their memory limits, and much more. As a result, the node special interest group within the Kubernetes project has invested significant effort into supporting swap on Linux nodes. The 1.22 release introduced Alpha support for configuring swap memory usage for Kubernetes workloads running on Linux on a per-node basis. Later, in release 1.28, support for swap on Linux nodes has graduated to Beta, along with many new improvements. In the following Kubernetes releases more improvements were made, paving the way to GA in the near future. Prior to version 1.22, Kubernetes did not provide support for swap memory on Linux systems. This was due to the inherent difficulty in guaranteeing and accounting for pod memory utilization when swap memory was involved. As a result, swap support was deemed out of scope in the initial design of Kubernetes, and the default behavior of a kubelet was to fail to start if swap memory was detected on a node. In version 1.22, the swap feature for Linux was initially introduced in its Alpha stage. This provided Linux users the opportunity to experiment with the swap feature for the first time. However, as an Alpha version, it was not fully developed and only partially worked on limited environments."><meta property="og:url" content="https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-03-25-fresh-swap-features-for-linux-users-in-kubernetes-1-32/"><meta property="og:site_name" content="Kubermates"><meta property="og:title" content="Fresh Swap Features for Linux Users in Kubernetes 1.32"><meta property="og:description" content="Fresh Swap Features for Linux Users in Kubernetes 1.32 How do I use it?

How do I get involved? Swap is a fundamental and an invaluable Linux feature. It offers numerous benefits, such as effectively increasing a node’s memory by swapping out unused data, shielding nodes from system-level memory spikes, preventing Pods from crashing when they hit their memory limits, and much more. As a result, the node special interest group within the Kubernetes project has invested significant effort into supporting swap on Linux nodes. The 1.22 release introduced Alpha support for configuring swap memory usage for Kubernetes workloads running on Linux on a per-node basis. Later, in release 1.28, support for swap on Linux nodes has graduated to Beta, along with many new improvements. In the following Kubernetes releases more improvements were made, paving the way to GA in the near future. Prior to version 1.22, Kubernetes did not provide support for swap memory on Linux systems. This was due to the inherent difficulty in guaranteeing and accounting for pod memory utilization when swap memory was involved. As a result, swap support was deemed out of scope in the initial design of Kubernetes, and the default behavior of a kubelet was to fail to start if swap memory was detected on a node. In version 1.22, the swap feature for Linux was initially introduced in its Alpha stage. This provided Linux users the opportunity to experiment with the swap feature for the first time. However, as an Alpha version, it was not fully developed and only partially worked on limited environments.</p></div></div></section><div class=td-content><p>Open the original post ↗ <a href=https://kubernetes.io/blog/2025/03/25/swap-linux-improvements/>https://kubernetes.io/blog/2025/03/25/swap-linux-improvements/</a></p></div><footer class="mt-4 pt-3 border-top d-flex flex-wrap gap-2 align-items-center"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-sm" href=https://kubernetes.io/blog/2025/03/25/swap-linux-improvements/ target=_blank rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Open
