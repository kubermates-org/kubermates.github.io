Starting today, Managed MySQL storage has doubled to 20TB, and Managed PostgreSQL now supports up to 30TB, up from 15TB. These expanded storage options are available in Singapore (SGP1), San Francisco (SFO2), and Frankfurt (FRA1), with plans to roll out to more regions later this year. Now users have even more flexibility to scale seamlessly, whether growing existing workloads or migrating from self-managed databases. With DigitalOceanâs fully managed service, you get the performance, security, and simplicity you needâwithout the operational burden. Scaling your databases is now easier than ever, helping to ensure your infrastructure keeps pace with your business growth. As your businesses grow, so do data storage requirements. Our expanded, scalable storage options allow you to: Big databases, no worries: Support large databases with up to 20TB and 30TB of scalable storage. Big databases, no worries: Support large databases with up to 20TB and 30TB of scalable storage. Control both performance and costs: Scale storage independently of CPU and memory, giving you the flexibility to adapt as your workload evolves. This ensures you pay only for what you need while avoiding over- or under-provisioning resources.
