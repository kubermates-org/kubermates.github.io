The problem? Pod IP addresses inside Kubernetes clusters are dynamic and non-routable. For external systems to recognize and trust this traffic, workloads need a consistent, dependable identity. This means outbound connections require fixed, routable IP addresses that external services can rely on. This is where Network Address Translation (NAT) becomes essential. It assigns Kubernetes pods with a static, consistent IP for all outbound traffic, ensuring those connections work properly. If you’re running Kubernetes in the cloud, a common solution is to use your cloud provider’s managed NAT gateway service. These are easy to use, but they can come at a cost. In AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud, cloud-managed NAT gateways charge both an hourly fee and a per-gigabyte data processing fee. For high-traffic deployments, those charges can quickly add up, sometimes even exceeding your compute costs. The good news: with Calico, you can handle NAT from inside your Kubernetes cluster, avoiding cloud NAT gateway fees and giving you more control over how egress works. Managed NAT gateways from cloud providers are designed for convenience, but they come with a few limitations: Ongoing hourly charges – even if you’re not sending much traffic.</description></item><item><title>New Research Reveals: Cloud Maturity is the Key to Private Cloud Success</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-09-04-new-research-reveals-cloud-maturity-is-the-key-to-private-cloud-success/</link><pubDate>Thu, 04 Sep 2025 19:04:09 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-09-04-new-research-reveals-cloud-maturity-is-the-key-to-private-cloud-success/</guid><description>Enterprises at mature stages of cloud adoption are 3x more likely to achieve their cloud goals and see dramatically better results across satisfaction, cost efficiency, and performance. The Private Cloud Renaissance The Maturity Advantage: A Game-Changing Discovery The Strategic Repatriation Trend What Separates the Leaders The Path Forward Ready to Assess Your Cloud Maturity? Related Articles New Research Reveals: Cloud Maturity is the Key to Private Cloud Success Broadcom and Canonical Partner to Fast-track and Secure Containerized Workload Deployments on VMware Cloud Foundation Strengthened Cyber-Risk Management and Compliance for Large-Scale VMware Cloud Foundation Environments Today, we’re excited to announce the release of our special edition report: “ Private Cloud Outlook: The Maturity Advantage. ” The research reveals a pivotal shift in how enterprises approach cloud strategy—and uncovers a critical success factor that separates high-performing organizations from the rest. Enterprises are fundamentally rethinking their cloud strategies, placing private cloud at the center to address today’s most pressing business challenges. While security, cost control, and data governance remain primary drivers, our research shows that private cloud has evolved into a powerful enabler for modern workloads, including AI initiatives. But here’s what’s truly fascinating: the benefits of private cloud aren’t just about the technology—they are about deployment maturity which also brings along people and process. When we analyzed responses through the lens of cloud maturity, a striking pattern emerged that reveals why some enterprises are pulling dramatically ahead of their peers. Enterprises that are mature in their cloud journey experience significantly superior results in strategic impact and operational excellence. They are investing in their infrastructure to drive business goals: 59% are increasing their private cloud investments, compared to 38% of developing-stage peers 60% rank private cloud workloads as their top IT priority, compared to 41% of developing-stage peers 90%+ report satisfaction in infrastructure operations, application deployment, security and compliance, compared to 50-65% satisfaction for developing-stage peers Perhaps most telling is the workload repatriation trend we discovered. Mature enterprises are 3x more likely to have repatriated workloads from public cloud , with 50% having brought modern, cloud-native applications back to private infrastructure. This isn’t about reversing failed migrations—it’s a deliberate, strategic move driven by heightened security concerns, rising costs, and the growing demands of modern workloads like AI. Our research identified six critical dimensions that determine cloud maturity progress across people, process and technology: Workload diversity – Successfully running both traditional and modern applications Self-service provisioning – Enabling tenant self-provisioning via catalogs and APIs Policy-based guardrails – Implementing automated governance for security and compliance Cost transparency – Providing chargeback/showback information to internal customers Platform model – Organizing around platform teams vs.</description></item><item><title>PSI Metrics for Kubernetes Graduates to Beta</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-09-04-psi-metrics-for-kubernetes-graduates-to-beta/</link><pubDate>Thu, 04 Sep 2025 10:30:00 -0800</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-09-04-psi-metrics-for-kubernetes-graduates-to-beta/</guid><description>PSI Metrics for Kubernetes Graduates to Beta What is Pressure Stall Information (PSI)? PSI metrics in Kubernetes How to enable PSI metrics What&amp;rsquo;s next? As Kubernetes clusters grow in size and complexity, understanding the health and performance of individual nodes becomes increasingly critical. We are excited to announce that as of Kubernetes v1.34, Pressure Stall Information (PSI) Metrics has graduated to Beta. Pressure Stall Information (PSI) is a feature of the Linux kernel (version 4.20 and later) that provides a canonical way to quantify pressure on infrastructure resources, in terms of whether demand for a resource exceeds current supply. It moves beyond simple resource utilization metrics and instead measures the amount of time that tasks are stalled due to resource contention. This is a powerful way to identify and diagnose resource bottlenecks that can impact application performance. PSI exposes metrics for CPU, memory, and I/O, categorized as either some or full pressure: some full some full These metrics are aggregated over 10-second, 1-minute, and 5-minute rolling windows, providing a comprehensive view of resource pressure over time. With the KubeletPSI feature gate enabled, the kubelet can now collect PSI metrics from the Linux kernel and expose them through two channels: the Summary API and the /metrics/cadvisor Prometheus endpoint. This allows you to monitor and alert on resource pressure at the node, pod, and container level. KubeletPSI /metrics/cadvisor The following new metrics are available in Prometheus exposition format via /metrics/cadvisor : /metrics/cadvisor container_pressure_cpu_stalled_seconds_total container_pressure_cpu_stalled_seconds_total container_pressure_cpu_waiting_seconds_total container_pressure_cpu_waiting_seconds_total container_pressure_memory_stalled_seconds_total container_pressure_memory_stalled_seconds_total container_pressure_memory_waiting_seconds_total container_pressure_memory_waiting_seconds_total container_pressure_io_stalled_seconds_total container_pressure_io_stalled_seconds_total container_pressure_io_waiting_seconds_total container_pressure_io_waiting_seconds_total These metrics, along with the data from the Summary API, provide a granular view of resource pressure, enabling you to pinpoint the source of performance issues and take corrective action. For example, you can use these metrics to: Identify memory leaks: A steadily increasing some pressure for memory can indicate a memory leak in an application. some Optimize resource requests and limits: By understanding the resource pressure of your workloads, you can more accurately tune their resource requests and limits. Autoscale workloads: You can use PSI metrics to trigger autoscaling events, ensuring that your workloads have the resources they need to perform optimally.</description></item><item><title>How to run AI model inference with GPUs on Amazon EKS Auto Mode</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-09-04-how-to-run-ai-model-inference-with-gpus-on-amazon-eks-auto-mode/</link><pubDate>Thu, 04 Sep 2025 16:12:23 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-09-04-how-to-run-ai-model-inference-with-gpus-on-amazon-eks-auto-mode/</guid><description>How to run AI model inference with GPUs on Amazon EKS Auto Mode Key features that make EKS Auto Mode ideal for AI/ML workloads Walkthrough Prerequisites Set up environment variables Set up EKS Auto Mode cluster and run a model Reducing model cold start time in AI inference workloads Conclusion About the authors AI model inference using GPUs is becoming a core part of modern applications, powering real-time recommendations, intelligent assistants, content generation, and other latency-sensitive AI features. Kubernetes has become the orchestrator of choice for running inference workloads, and organizations want to use its capabilities while still maintaining a strong focus on rapid innovation and time-to-market. But here’s the challenge: while teams see the value of Kubernetes for its dynamic scaling and efficient resource management, they often get slowed down by the need to learn Kubernetes concepts, manage cluster configurations, and handle security updates. This shifts focus away from what matters most: deploying and optimizing AI models. That is where Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (Amazon EKS) Auto Mode comes in. EKS Auto Mode Automates node creation, manages core capabilities , and handles upgrades and security patching. In turn, this enables to run your inference workloads without the operational overhead. In this post, we show you how to swiftly deploy inference workloads on EKS Auto Mode. We also demonstrate key features that streamline GPU management, show best practices for model deployment, and walk through a practical example by deploying open weight models from OpenAI using vLLM. Whether you’re building a new AI/machine learning (ML) platform or optimizing existing workflows, these patterns help you accelerate development while maintaining operational efficiency. In this section, we take a closer look at the GPU-specific features that come pre-configured and ready to use with an EKS Auto Mode cluster. These capabilities are also available in self-managed Amazon EKS environments, but they typically need manual setup and tuning.</description></item><item><title>The Debug Trap: Why Smart Engineers Waste Hours on Trivial Problems</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-09-04-the-debug-trap-why-smart-engineers-waste-hours-on-trivial-problems/</link><pubDate>Thu, 04 Sep 2025 16:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-09-04-the-debug-trap-why-smart-engineers-waste-hours-on-trivial-problems/</guid><description>The Question Nobody Asks The Change Principle (It’s Not Rocket Science) The Revert Rebellion The Exotic Bug Fallacy The Debug Stack The Meta Problem Posted on September 4, 2025 by Anshul Sao, Co-Founder &amp;amp; CTO at Facets. cloud Last month, I watched three senior engineers burn four hours debugging a “mysterious” Kubernetes issue that turned out to be a kubectl version upgrade.

Kubecost savings insights Customizing recommendations Acting on Kubecost recommendations One-time resizing Scheduled right sizing Automating resizing with Helm Conclusion About the authors This post was co-written with Kai Wombacher, Founding Product Manager at Kubecost. In this post we show you how to use the Kubecost Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (Amazon EKS) add-on to lower infrastructure costs and boost Kubernetes efficiency. The Container Request Right Sizing feature allows you to find how container requests are configured, look for inefficiencies, and fix them either manually or through automated remediation. Specifically, we cover how to review Kubecost’s right sizing recommendations and take action on them using one-time updates or scheduled, automated resizing within your Amazon EKS environment to continuously optimize resource usage. Over-requested containers are one of the most common sources of cloud resource waste in Kubernetes environments. Without visibility and automation, development teams can request far more resources than their applications use, which leads to overprovisioned nodes and higher costs. In Kubernetes, a container request is a declared amount of CPU and memory that a workload needs. It plays a crucial role in how workloads are scheduled and how nodes are used. When a container specifies a CPU or memory request, the scheduler looks for a node that has at least that amount of unallocated capacity. When a pod is placed on a node, the requested resources are essentially reserved, regardless of whether the container uses them in practice. Although this reservation behavior makes sure that workloads have access to the resources they need, it can also lead to inefficient resource usage if requests are set too high. For example, if a container requests 1 CPU but only uses 200 millicores (0.2 CPU), then that added 0.8 CPU goes unused, yet the node capacity is still reserved and charged for.</description></item><item><title>Kubernetes v1.34: Service Account Token Integration for Image Pulls Graduates to Beta</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-09-03-kubernetes-v1-34-service-account-token-integration-for-image-pulls-graduates-to-/</link><pubDate>Wed, 03 Sep 2025 10:30:00 -0800</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-09-03-kubernetes-v1-34-service-account-token-integration-for-image-pulls-graduates-to-/</guid><description>Kubernetes v1.34: Service Account Token Integration for Image Pulls Graduates to Beta What&amp;rsquo;s new in beta? Required cacheType field Isolated image pull credentials How it works Configuration Image pull flow Audience restriction Getting started with beta Prerequisites Migration from alpha Example setup What&amp;rsquo;s next? Call to action How to get involved The Kubernetes community continues to advance security best practices by reducing reliance on long-lived credentials. Following the successful alpha release in Kubernetes v1.33 , Service Account Token Integration for Kubelet Credential Providers has now graduated to beta in Kubernetes v1.34, bringing us closer to eliminating long-lived image pull secrets from Kubernetes clusters. This enhancement allows credential providers to use workload-specific service account tokens to obtain registry credentials, providing a secure, ephemeral alternative to traditional image pull secrets. The beta graduation brings several important changes that make the feature more robust and production-ready: cacheType Breaking change from alpha : The cacheType field is required in the credential provider configuration when using service account tokens. This field is new in beta and must be specified to ensure proper caching behavior. cacheType # CAUTION: this is not a complete configuration example, just a reference for the &amp;rsquo;tokenAttributes. cacheType&amp;rsquo; field. tokenAttributes : serviceAccountTokenAudience : &amp;ldquo;my-registry-audience&amp;rdquo; cacheType : &amp;ldquo;ServiceAccount&amp;rdquo; # Required field in beta requireServiceAccount : true # CAUTION: this is not a complete configuration example, just a reference for the &amp;rsquo;tokenAttributes. cacheType&amp;rsquo; field. tokenAttributes : serviceAccountTokenAudience : &amp;ldquo;my-registry-audience&amp;rdquo; cacheType : &amp;ldquo;ServiceAccount&amp;rdquo; # Required field in beta requireServiceAccount : true Choose between two caching strategies: Token : Cache credentials per service account token (use when credential lifetime is tied to the token). This is useful when the credential provider transforms the service account token into registry credentials with the same lifetime as the token, or when registries support Kubernetes service account tokens directly. Note: The kubelet cannot send service account tokens directly to registries; credential provider plugins are needed to transform tokens into the username/password format expected by registries.</description></item><item><title>Securing the Node: A Primer on Cilium’s Host Firewall</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-09-03-securing-the-node-a-primer-on-cilium-s-host-firewall/</link><pubDate>Wed, 03 Sep 2025 14:02:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-09-03-securing-the-node-a-primer-on-cilium-s-host-firewall/</guid><description>The Node as a Blind Spot How Cilium’s Host Firewall Works Enabling Host Firewall Audit Mode Observe Network Traffic with Hubble Writing Host Network Policies Enforcing the Policy Best Practices and Troubleshooting Tips Conclusion Additional Resources: Posted on September 3, 2025 by Paul Arah, Isovalent @ Cisco When discussing Kubernetes network security, much of the attention focuses on pod-to-pod traffic, ingress controllers, and service meshes. But what about the underlying nodes themselves, the very foundation on which our workloads run? The attack surface that Kubernetes nodes expose is vast and, if left unprotected, can become a golden ticket for malicious actors. Cilium host firewall is built to lock down the host network namespace with precision, visibility, and control, extending the same familiar declarative Kubernetes network policy model to the underlying host. In this blog post, we’ll explore what Cilium Host Firewall is, how it works, and why it should be a core part of your Kubernetes security. Kubernetes native network policies don’t apply to host-level traffic. This means any communication that enters or leaves the host directly (for example, SSH, kubelet, or external monitoring agents) is largely invisible to traditional Kubernetes policy enforcement. While some firewalling is possible via firewalld or external systems, managing those rules is brittle and lacks integration with Kubernetes. At its core, this is the problem Cilium Host Firewall solves. Leveraging eBPF, Cilium introduces host firewalling directly into the fabric of the cluster. Cilium treats the node as a special type of endpoint with the label reserved:host. This lets us apply policies just like we would for pods, except these apply to traffic to and from the node(s) themselves. Cilium host firewall operates at the interface level.</description></item><item><title>Sharks of DigitalOcean: Archana Kamath, Senior Director, IaaS</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-09-03-sharks-of-digitalocean-archana-kamath-senior-director-iaas/</link><pubDate>Wed, 03 Sep 2025 04:09:34 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-09-03-sharks-of-digitalocean-archana-kamath-senior-director-iaas/</guid><description>Sharks of DigitalOcean: Archana Kamath, Senior Director, IaaS What makes DigitalOcean the right place for you?

It&amp;rsquo;s an end-to-end solution that provides data confidentiality on cloud platforms by isolating a cluster from its underlying infrastructure. In a confidential cluster, all nodes run on top of confidential virtual machines (cVM). Before a node can join the cluster and access secrets, the platform and environment&amp;rsquo;s authenticity are verified through remote attestation. This process involves communication with a trusted remote server. Confidential Clusters enables you to use Red Hat OpenShift, a trusted platform to develop, modernize, and deploy applications at scale and leverage the convenience and flexibility of the cloud services without compromising on data security. This is critical for industries such as financial services, health care, and government that need to adhere to the regulatory requirements such as the European Digital Operational Resiliency Act (DORA). The general availability of OpenShift confidential nodes on cVM is now offered with AMD SEV-SNP and Intel TDX integration on Google Cloud Platform (GCP), as well as with AMD SEV-SNP on Azure in OpenShift version 4.19. Support for Intel TDX on Azure will be available in version 4.20 and above. Additionally, the integration of remote attestation is currently under development and will be included in future OpenShift releases. It’s a complex technology, but that doesn&amp;rsquo;t mean it&amp;rsquo;s complex to set up.

Generative AI (gen AI) models are now smaller, faster, and cheaper to run. They can solve mathematical problems, analyze situations, and even reason about cause‑and‑effect relationships to generate insights that once required human expertise. On its own, an AI model is merely a set of trained weights and mathematical operations, an impressive engine, but one sitting idle on a test bench. Business value only emerges when that model is embedded within a complete AI system: data pipelines feed it clean, context‑rich inputs, application logic orchestrates pre‑ and post‑processing, guardrails and monitoring enforce safety, security, and compliance, and user interfaces deliver insights through chatbots, dashboards, or automated actions. In practice, end users engage with systems, not raw models, which is why a single foundational model can power hundreds of tailored solutions across domains. Without the surrounding infrastructure of an AI system, even the most advanced model remains untapped potential rather than a tool that solves real‑world problems. AI model cards are files that accompany and describe the model, helping AI system developers make informed decisions about which model to choose for their applications. Model cards present a concise, standardized snapshot of each model’s strengths, limitations, and training information, summarizing performance metrics across key benchmarks, detailing the data and methodology used for training and evaluation, highlighting known biases and failure modes, and spelling out licensing terms and governance contacts. With this information in one place, it&amp;rsquo;s easier to assess whether a model aligns with accuracy targets, fairness requirements, deployment constraints, and compliance obligations, reducing integration risk and accelerating responsible adoption. In November 2024, we authored a paper addressing the rapidly evolving ecosystem of publicly available AI models and their potential implications for security and safety. In this paper we proposed standardization of model cards and extensions to include safety, security, and data governance and pedigree information.</description></item><item><title>Understanding AI agent types: A guide to categorizing complexity</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-09-03-understanding-ai-agent-types-a-guide-to-categorizing-complexity/</link><pubDate>Wed, 03 Sep 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-09-03-understanding-ai-agent-types-a-guide-to-categorizing-complexity/</guid><description>Understanding AI agent types: A guide to categorizing complexity 1.

Organizations developing applications for natural language processing, scientific simulations, 3D content generation, and multimodal inference need infrastructure that can scale from today’s billion-parameter models to tomorrow’s trillion-parameter frontiers while maintaining performance. In this post, we explore how the new Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) P6e-GB200 UltraServers are transforming distributed AI workload through seamless Kubernetes integration. Amazon Web Services (AWS) introduced the EC2 P6e-GB200 UltraServers to meet the growing demand for large-scale AI model training and inference. They represent a significant architectural breakthrough for distributed AI workloads. Furthermore, the EC2 P6e-GB200 UltraServer launch includes support for Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (Amazon EKS) , providing a Kubernetes-native environment for deploying and scaling from hundreds-of-billions to trillion-parameter models as the AI landscape continues to evolve. At the heart of EC2 P6e-GB200 UltraServers is the NVIDIA GB200 Grace Blackwell Superchip , which integrates two NVIDIA Blackwell GPUs with a NVIDIA Grace CPU. Furthermore, it provides NVLink-Chip-to-Chip (C2C) connection between these components, delivering 900 GB/s of bidirectional bandwidth, which is substantially faster than traditional PCIe interfaces. When deployed at rack scale, EC2 P6e-GB200 UltraServers participate in NVIDIA’s GB200 NVL72 architecture , creating memory-coherent domains of up to 72 GPUs. Fifth-generation NVLink technology enables GPU-to-GPU communication across discrete servers within the same domain at up to 1.8 TB/s per GPU. Critical to this performance is Elastic Fabric Adapter (EFAv4) networking, which delivers up to 28.8 Tbps of total network bandwidth per UltraServer.</description></item><item><title>What's New on DigitalOcean App Platform</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-09-02-what-s-new-on-digitalocean-app-platform/</link><pubDate>Tue, 02 Sep 2025 23:01:24 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-09-02-what-s-new-on-digitalocean-app-platform/</guid><description>What&amp;rsquo;s New on DigitalOcean App Platform Week of September 1st About the author Try DigitalOcean for free Related Articles Single Sign-On is Now Available, Strengthening Security and Simplifying Authentication Announcing OpenAI gpt-oss Models on the DigitalOcean Gradientâ¢ AI Platform Build smarter AI agents: new tools now available for the DigitalOcean Gradientâ¢ AI Platform By Waverly Swinton Published: September 2, 2025 1 min read Welcome to Whatâs New on DigitalOcean App Platform â your weekly roundup of the latest updates for App Platform.

It monitors, manages, and optimizes IT operations by collecting data using management packs. VCF Operations includes built-in packs for components like vCenter and VCF. Additionally, it provides tools—a management pack builder and an Integration SDK—that enable users to develop custom management packs for monitoring applications and infrastructure components not covered by the built-in options. These user-developed management packs can be uploaded and deployed to specific environments, allowing organizations to tailor their monitoring capabilities and integrate diverse technologies within their VCF ecosystem. The Integration SDK provides tools and libraries in Python and Java to aid in development of management packs to add custom objects, data, and relationships from an endpoint into VCF Operations. The Integration SDK generates containerized management packs and hence requires a container registry for its storage and retrieval. This container registry must be accessible by the VCF Operations Cloud Proxies to download the container. By default, the Integration SDK’s build environment’s container registry must be accessible by the VCF Operations Cloud proxies in the intended deployment environment. In most scenarios, the container registry used by the Integration SDK’s build environment is accessible by the VCF Operations Cloud Proxies in the deployed environment. However, in the following situations, Integration SDKs build environment’s container registry may not be accessible by the VCF Operations Cloud proxies in the intended deployment environment: VCF Operations has been deployed in an air-gapped environment and there is no connectivity to the internet to access public container registry. The VCF Operations Integration SDK’s build environment has used a private container registry and there is no connectivity from the customer’s infrastructure to this private container registry.</description></item><item><title>Kubernetes v1.34: Introducing CPU Manager Static Policy Option for Uncore Cache Alignment</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-09-02-kubernetes-v1-34-introducing-cpu-manager-static-policy-option-for-uncore-cache-a/</link><pubDate>Tue, 02 Sep 2025 10:30:00 -0800</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-09-02-kubernetes-v1-34-introducing-cpu-manager-static-policy-option-for-uncore-cache-a/</guid><description>Kubernetes v1.34: Introducing CPU Manager Static Policy Option for Uncore Cache Alignment Understanding the feature What is uncore cache? Cache-aware workload placement Use cases Enabling the feature Further reading Getting involved A new CPU Manager Static Policy Option called prefer-align-cpus-by-uncorecache was introduced in Kubernetes v1.32 as an alpha feature, and has graduated to beta in Kubernetes v1.34. This CPU Manager Policy Option is designed to optimize performance for specific workloads running on processors with a split uncore cache architecture. In this article, I&amp;rsquo;ll explain what that means and why it&amp;rsquo;s useful. prefer-align-cpus-by-uncorecache Until relatively recently, nearly all mainstream computer processors had a monolithic last-level-cache cache that was shared across every core in a multiple CPU package. This monolithic cache is also referred to as uncore cache (because it is not linked to a specific core), or as Level 3 cache. As well as the Level 3 cache, there is other cache, commonly called Level 1 and Level 2 cache, that is associated with a specific CPU core. In order to reduce access latency between the CPU cores and their cache, recent AMD64 and ARM architecture based processors have introduced a split uncore cache architecture, where the last-level-cache is divided into multiple physical caches, that are aligned to specific CPU groupings within the physical package. The shorter distances within the CPU package help to reduce latency. Kubernetes is able to place workloads in a way that accounts for the cache topology within the CPU package(s). The matrix below shows the CPU-to-CPU latency measured in nanoseconds (lower is better) when passing a packet between CPUs, via its cache coherence protocol on a processor that uses split uncore cache. In this example, the processor package consists of 2 uncore caches. Each uncore cache serves 8 CPU cores.</description></item><item><title>Beyond Terraform Modules: Infrastructure Design by Contract</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-09-02-beyond-terraform-modules-infrastructure-design-by-contract/</link><pubDate>Tue, 02 Sep 2025 17:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-09-02-beyond-terraform-modules-infrastructure-design-by-contract/</guid><description>The Hidden Tax of Module Stitching Four Pillars of Infrastructure Design by Contract 1.

You’re staring at a failed deployment pipeline, trying to figure out why your EKS cluster can’t find the right subnets. You’ve checked the variables, verified the outputs, and triple-checked your depends_on statements. Everything looks correct, yet it still fails. This scenario plays out daily across organizations that have adopted Terraform. While modules promised composable, reusable infrastructure, the reality has become a complex web of string-matching, implicit dependencies, and tribal knowledge. How much of your team’s time is spent debugging module connections rather than delivering value? Every time a team provisions infrastructure for a new service or application, they pay an invisible tax in cognitive overhead: For each input a module needs, someone must make critical decisions: Is this value a hard-coded constant? A data lookup? An output from another module? The answer differs for every project and environment, so this decision tree must be rebuilt from scratch each time.</description></item><item><title>Single Sign-On is Now Available, Strengthening Security and Simplifying Authentication</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-09-02-single-sign-on-is-now-available-strengthening-security-and-simplifying-authentic/</link><pubDate>Tue, 02 Sep 2025 15:43:19 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-09-02-single-sign-on-is-now-available-strengthening-security-and-simplifying-authentic/</guid><description>Single Sign-On is Now Available, Strengthening Security and Simplifying Authentication Single Sign-On is Now Available, Strengthening Security and Simplifying Authentication Why Single Sign-On matters How Single Sign-On can benefit your business How SSO on DigitalOcean works Get started with SSO on DigitalOcean About the author Try DigitalOcean for free Related Articles Announcing OpenAI gpt-oss Models on the DigitalOcean Gradientâ¢ AI Platform Build smarter AI agents: new tools now available for the DigitalOcean Gradientâ¢ AI Platform Introducing GPU Droplets accelerated by NVIDIA HGX H200 By Nicole Ghalwash Published: September 2, 2025 3 min read Good news: Single Sign-On (SSO) is now available for all DigitalOcean customers via Okta OpenID Connect (OIDC). Single Sign-On represents a major step forward in strengthening security, simplifying user management, and empowering teams to be more productive on DigitalOcean. For growing teams, managing user accounts across multiple platforms can quickly become a challenge. Password resets, manual onboarding, and offboarding all add up, not just for the IT teamâbut developers feel it too in terms of lost productivity. That means: No more juggling multiple usernames and passwords. No more juggling multiple usernames and passwords. Centralized access management that scales with your team. No more wasting time being locked out of critical apps. Stronger, consistent security across your entire toolchain. As organizations grow, managing user access across multiple tools and platforms can become complex, time-consuming, and costly. Single Sign-On solves this problem by allowing employees to securely access all their applications with a single set of credentials. By centralizing authentication, SSO not only strengthens security but also streamlines onboarding, reduces IT workload, and gives teams a seamless login experience that helps them stay focused on building and innovating.</description></item><item><title>EMEA’s cloud sovereignty puzzle takes shape</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-09-02-emea-s-cloud-sovereignty-puzzle-takes-shape/</link><pubDate>Tue, 02 Sep 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-09-02-emea-s-cloud-sovereignty-puzzle-takes-shape/</guid><description>EMEA’s cloud sovereignty puzzle takes shape More like this Blog post Blog post Blog post Keep exploring Browse by channel Automation Artificial intelligence Open hybrid cloud Security Edge computing Infrastructure Applications Virtualization Share Digital sovereignty is not a new topic, but recent events on the world stage have catapulted it to the top of the top of boardroom agendas and government priorities alike. According to a 2025 BARC study , 84% of surveyed companies view data sovereignty as a central point of their strategy, and 70 percent report significantly increased relevance in the past one to two years. Meanwhile, industry analyst firm Gartner forecasts the sovereign cloud IaaS market will be worth $169 billion in 2028 , up from $37 billion last year. Different countries and organisations are adopting different approaches to digital and cloud sovereignty, some are cautiously waiting and watching to see how things shake out, others are acting fast. While there remains a certain degree of uncertainty over exactly what digital and cloud sovereignty looks like, most industry watchers agree that it will be ‘need to have’ rather than ‘nice to have. ’ For a broader perspective on digital sovereignty, we caught up with Red Hat country and regional leaders across Europe to test the waters in local markets. Gregor von Jagow, Country Manager, Germany: “We’re seeing demand across all sectors. ” Germany has long prioritized digital sovereignty, partly due to the cautious nature of its businesses. With geopolitical tensions and market consolidation, local cloud providers play a vital role. We partner with local players like IONOS and StackIT (a subsidiary of Schwarz Group) that are driving the sovereignty conversation in Germany. These providers are often best positioned to deliver the level of control and adherence to local regulations that truly define sovereign cloud solutions for customers. We’re seeing demand across all sectors, not just government.</description></item><item><title>Protect and unify with Commvault and Red Hat OpenShift: A modern approach to disaster recovery for VMs and containers</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-09-02-protect-and-unify-with-commvault-and-red-hat-openshift-a-modern-approach-to-disa/</link><pubDate>Tue, 02 Sep 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-09-02-protect-and-unify-with-commvault-and-red-hat-openshift-a-modern-approach-to-disa/</guid><description>Protect and unify with Commvault and Red Hat OpenShift: A modern approach to disaster recovery for VMs and containers A unified approach to backup and recovery Take the next step in your modernization journey Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform | Product Trial About the author Dan Bettinger More like this Blog post Blog post Blog post Keep exploring Browse by channel Automation Artificial intelligence Open hybrid cloud Security Edge computing Infrastructure Applications Virtualization Share The path to modernization isn&amp;rsquo;t always the least distance between two points. As enterprises embrace containerization for speed and scalability, a significant number of business-critical workloads continue to run on virtual machines (VM). Managing these two distinct environments is complex enough as it is, but then there&amp;rsquo;s also disaster recovery. How do you ensure rapid, reliable recovery for both platforms without doubling complexity and cost? What if you could unify your virtualized and containerized workloads on a single, modern platform with a more consistent, effective strategy for backup and disaster recovery? Red Hat OpenShift Virtualization enables organizations to do just that. It&amp;rsquo;s an included feature of Red Hat OpenShift that allows you to run and manage VMs and containers on the same Kubernetes-based platform. This modern approach streamlines IT infrastructure, but it&amp;rsquo;s the ability to protect it that brings peace of mind. Commvault has long supported container backup and disaster recovery on Red Hat OpenShift. Now Commvault is extending its support for Red Hat OpenShift to include Red Hat OpenShift Virtualization so that the same unified platform now also protects VMs running alongside containers. Specifically Commvault Long-Term Support Release 11.40 and Commvault Innovation Release 11.42 will support the versions of OpenShift Virtualization that are part of Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 4.18 and 4.19. For years, IT leaders have struggled with a fragmented approach to disaster recovery. Using separate backup tools for VMs and containers creates operational silos, increases the risk of data loss, and complicates recovery efforts when a disaster (such as a ransomware attack) occurs. With Commvault’s enterprise-grade data protection now extended to VMs running on Red Hat OpenShift Virtualization, you can finally implement a single, cohesive backup and recovery strategy.</description></item><item><title>The Metadata Assistant: How Red Hat is using generative AI to make web content easier to find and use</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-09-02-the-metadata-assistant-how-red-hat-is-using-generative-ai-to-make-web-content-ea/</link><pubDate>Tue, 02 Sep 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-09-02-the-metadata-assistant-how-red-hat-is-using-generative-ai-to-make-web-content-ea/</guid><description>The Metadata Assistant: How Red Hat is using generative AI to make web content easier to find and use Facing challenges with metadata accuracy How Red Hat&amp;rsquo;s Metadata Assistant helps How it works: Relieving Red Hatters from long forms and tedious tasks Conclusion Get started with AI Inference About the authors Anna McHugh Gail Vadia More like this Blog post Blog post Blog post Keep exploring Browse by channel Automation Artificial intelligence Open hybrid cloud Security Edge computing Infrastructure Applications Virtualization Share Most of us rely on good web metadata every day, perhaps hundreds of times a day, without ever realizing it. While we don’t all see metadata, it’s present on every webpage, providing details for categorizing content. Search and information retrieval software—from content management systems and search engines to generative AI (gen AI) chatbots—all depend on metadata to categorize, interpret, and display content to users. In some ways, metadata is like the classification system librarians use to place books on shelves so that visitors can find them. Much like a library catalog, good web metadata makes content easier to find and use because it has consistent, meaningful labels. At Red Hat, we maintain dozens of websites with tens of thousands of pages and millions of metadata selections. To help manage it all, we’ve developed a new internal generative AI (gen AI) tool: the Metadata Assistant. Despite our best efforts to stay organized, we struggle to make accurate and consistent tags. The overwhelming amount of content to classify can feel like a messy, towering pile of books instead of an organized library where you can browse the shelves by meaningful categories. Red Hatters must consider more than 150 taxonomy choices across several parent categories, like products, topics, industries, regions, and partners when classifying their content. Our product portfolio is complex, with products frequently being added, discontinued, or renamed. Metadata best practices can be tricky for teams to keep up with.</description></item><item><title>What’s new with data science pipelines in Red Hat OpenShift AI</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-09-02-what-s-new-with-data-science-pipelines-in-red-hat-openshift-ai/</link><pubDate>Tue, 02 Sep 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-09-02-what-s-new-with-data-science-pipelines-in-red-hat-openshift-ai/</guid><description>What’s new with data science pipelines in Red Hat OpenShift AI So, what exactly are data science pipelines in OpenShift AI? Creating a pipeline (and then what?)

Many teams hit roadblocks when trying to automate, scale, or manage their ML pipelines—especially as projects grow, scope creeps, and requirements inevitably change. Red Hat OpenShift AI now brings a set of updates to data science pipelines, making it easier than ever to control and optimize your ML processes. These improvements aren’t just about new features, they’re also about helping you optimize resource consumption and minimize the 2am on-call page-outs by building workflows you can trust in production. Think of a data science pipeline in OpenShift AI as the navigation system for your entire ML workflow. You can visually build this pipeline, which is powered by a structure called a directed acyclic graph (DAG). A DAG acts as the blueprint for your process, from data prep to deployment, by mapping out each task in a clear, one-way workflow. This structure is what makes sure that every step runs in the correct order and your pipeline doesn&amp;rsquo;t get stuck in an infinite loop. This blueprint or map is technically a graph where each component (a node) runs inside of a container on Red Hat OpenShift. These nodes are connected by edges (think of this as the arrows on a flow chart), which define their dependencies, so a task only runs after its prerequisites are met and the appropriate outputs go to the right places (the inputs of the next steps). The graph is &amp;ldquo;directed&amp;rdquo; because the workflow only moves forward and &amp;ldquo;acyclic&amp;rdquo; because it can&amp;rsquo;t circle back on itself. This workflow gives you precise control over your ML operations, making more efficient use of cluster resources.</description></item><item><title>Why defence organisations need resilience beyond sovereignty</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-09-02-why-defence-organisations-need-resilience-beyond-sovereignty/</link><pubDate>Tue, 02 Sep 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-09-02-why-defence-organisations-need-resilience-beyond-sovereignty/</guid><description>Why defence organisations need resilience beyond sovereignty Why autonomy matters The three pillars of autonomy Open source is the foundation of autonomy Beyond sovereignty to resilience Learn more Red Hat Learning Subscription | Product Trial About the author Giuseppe Magnotta More like this Blog post Blog post Blog post Keep exploring Browse by channel Automation Artificial intelligence Open hybrid cloud Security Edge computing Infrastructure Applications Virtualization Share Amid rising geopolitical tensions, digital sovereignty has become a focal point for governments and enterprises alike. However, for defence organisations, sovereignty alone is not enough. The ability to maintain operational resilience in the face of conflict or severe geopolitical disruption requires the capacity to act independently when cooperation is impossible. Only true autonomy can provide that ability. Digital sovereignty , whether cloud, data, or total sovereignty, refers to control over digital assets, so data, hardware, people, and software remain within a specific jurisdiction. While sovereignty addresses regulatory and jurisdictional concerns, it does not guarantee operational continuity in crisis scenarios. Strategic autonomy, however, goes further. It means maintaining the ability to collaborate with international partners when possible, while retaining the independence to operate alone when necessary. For defence organisations, this is a matter of mission survival. In peacetime, reliance on hyperscale cloud providers and distributed IT infrastructure is manageable. But in conflict, the landscape shifts dramatically. Physical destruction can render data centres inoperable, while internet outages cripple cloud-dependent operations.</description></item><item><title>Kubernetes v1.34: DRA has graduated to GA</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-09-01-kubernetes-v1-34-dra-has-graduated-to-ga/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Sep 2025 10:30:00 -0800</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-09-01-kubernetes-v1-34-dra-has-graduated-to-ga/</guid><description>Kubernetes v1.34: DRA has graduated to GA The core of DRA is now GA Features promoted to beta New alpha features What’s next?

This release marks a major milestone with many APIs in the resource. k8s. io group graduating to General Availability (GA), unlocking the full potential of how you manage devices on Kubernetes. On top of that, several key features have moved to beta, and a fresh batch of new alpha features promise even more expressiveness and flexibility. resource. k8s. io Let&amp;rsquo;s dive into what&amp;rsquo;s new for DRA in Kubernetes 1.34! The headline feature of the v1.34 release is that the core of DRA has graduated to General Availability. Kubernetes Dynamic Resource Allocation (DRA) provides a flexible framework for managing specialized hardware and infrastructure resources, such as GPUs or FPGAs. DRA provides APIs that enable each workload to specify the properties of the devices it needs, but leaving it to the scheduler to allocate actual devices, allowing increased reliability and improved utilization of expensive hardware. With the graduation to GA, DRA is stable and will be part of Kubernetes for the long run. The community can still expect a steady stream of new features being added to DRA over the next several Kubernetes releases, but they will not make any breaking changes to DRA. So users and developers of DRA drivers can start adopting DRA with confidence.</description></item><item><title>Jaeger at 10: Forged in Community, Reborn in OpenTelemetry</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-09-01-jaeger-at-10-forged-in-community-reborn-in-opentelemetry/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Sep 2025 14:57:18 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-09-01-jaeger-at-10-forged-in-community-reborn-in-opentelemetry/</guid><description>Most Challenging Part of Tracing Journey to v2 Fueling the Future: The Mentorship Pipeline Mature Ecosystem of Tracing Recognition of the Community Posted on September 1, 2025 by Yuri Shkuro and Jonah Kowall, Jaeger Maintainers In the fast-paced world of software, reaching 10 years is a testament to a project’s resilience, utility, and community strength. Half a decade ago, we celebrated Jaeger’s fifth anniversary , marveling at its growth from a nascent idea to a critical component in the observability stack. Today, as we mark 10 years, we’re not just celebrating longevity; we’re celebrating a profound evolution. Jaeger has been reborn, embracing a future built on collaboration, standardization, and the incredible momentum of OpenTelemetry. For years, the most significant barrier to adopting distributed tracing wasn’t the backend. It was instrumentation. Getting telemetry data out of applications was a complex, often proprietary, and labor-intensive process. Every tracing system had its own SDKs, its own agents, and its own way of doing things. This fragmentation created vendor lock-in and a steep learning curve, hindering widespread adoption. This is where OpenTelemetry changed everything. It didn’t just offer another SDK; it advanced the entire practice of instrumentation. By providing a single, vendor-neutral standard, OpenTelemetry unified both manual instrumentation (SDKs) and automatic instrumentation (agents).</description></item><item><title>Announcing Kyverno Release 1.15!</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-08-30-announcing-kyverno-release-1-15/</link><pubDate>Sat, 30 Aug 2025 13:31:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-08-30-announcing-kyverno-release-1-15/</guid><description>TL;DR New Policy Types MutatingPolicy: Flexible Resource Transformation GeneratingPolicy: Intelligent Resource Creation DeletingPolicy: Controlled Cleanup Made Easy Pod Security Standard(PSS) Policy Performance: ClusterPolicy vs ValidatingPolicy Key Performance Improvements Why It Matters New OpenReports API Group Support Community &amp;amp; Contributions Getting Started What’s Next? Conclusion Posted on August 30, 2025 by The Kyverno Team CNCF projects highlighted in this post Kyverno 1.15 makes Kubernetes policy management more powerful, extensible, and user-friendly. We are thrilled to announce the release of Kyverno 1.15.0, continuing our mission to make policy management in Kubernetes environments more modular, performant, and user-friendly. This release introduces new capabilities across multiple policy types, enhances testing and CLI functionality, and brings many improvements that a vibrant community has contributed. New MutatingPolicy for dynamic resource transformation with native Kubernetes integration New GeneratingPolicy for intelligent resource creation and synchronization using CEL expressions New DeletingPolicy resource for controlled cleanup of Kubernetes resources Advanced CEL functions and enhanced policy exception support for fine-grained control Community milestone: over 850 changes merged from 70+ contributors, including many first-timers! Building on the foundation of ValidatingPolicy and ImageValidatingPolicy from previous releases, Kyverno 1.15 introduces three new CEL-based policy types that complete our comprehensive policy ecosystem. While Kyverno, created by Nirmata, maintains its traditional policy engine capabilities, these new policy types provide native Kubernetes integration by automatically converting to Kubernetes admission controllers – MutatingPolicy converts to MutatingAdmissionPolicy (MAP) and ValidatingPolicy converts to ValidatingAdmissionPolicy (VAP). This hybrid approach gives users the flexibility to choose between Kyverno’s rich policy engine features and native Kubernetes performance. The new MutatingPolicy type provides native Kubernetes integration through MutatingAdmissionPolicy, offering: Full support for all functions that a mutate rule of a traditional policy supports Easier for each loop iteration with CEL’s map() and filter() functions Full support of advanced custom CEL libraries for complex policy logic CLI support for offline resources mutation in CI/CD pipelines Here is an example of adding default labels to deployments.

With the release of Kubernetes 1.34, a new alpha feature is introduced that gives you more granular control over container restarts within a Pod. This feature, named Container Restart Policy and Rules , allows you to specify a restart policy for each container individually, overriding the Pod&amp;rsquo;s global restart policy. In addition, it also allows you to conditionally restart individual containers based on their exit codes. This feature is available behind the alpha feature gate ContainerRestartRules. ContainerRestartRules This has been a long-requested feature. Let&amp;rsquo;s dive into how it works and how you can use it. Before this feature, the restartPolicy was set at the Pod level. This meant that all containers in a Pod shared the same restart policy ( Always , OnFailure , or Never ). While this works for many use cases, it can be limiting in others. restartPolicy Always OnFailure Never For example, consider a Pod with a main application container and an init container that performs some initial setup. You might want the main container to always restart on failure, but the init container should only run once and never restart. With a single Pod-level restart policy, this wasn&amp;rsquo;t possible.</description></item><item><title>From VLAN Tag to Segment: Using Guest VLAN Tagging in NSX</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-08-29-from-vlan-tag-to-segment-using-guest-vlan-tagging-in-nsx/</link><pubDate>Fri, 29 Aug 2025 18:16:13 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-08-29-from-vlan-tag-to-segment-using-guest-vlan-tagging-in-nsx/</guid><description>Guest VLAN Tagging alone… not great with NSX Mapping VLAN Tags to NSX Segments Step 1 – Attach the VM to a segment Step 2 – Convert the VM’s port into a parent port Step 3 – Create child ports for each VLAN Notes Configuration steps VM Configuration Creation of a child port using API Step 1 – Retrieve the VM’s Port Step 2 – Convert the Port into a Parent Port Step 3 – Create a Child Port for VLAN 10 Creation of a Child Port for via UI Related Articles From VLAN Tag to Segment: Using Guest VLAN Tagging in NSX Save Costs and Scale Efficiently with vSAN Deduplication in VMware Cloud Foundation 9.0 How to Connect your VMware Private AI Services Agents to OpenWeb UI By default, a virtual machine sends traffic to its vNIC untagged. The virtual switch then receives that traffic into a single VLAN or NSX segment. This model limits a VM to connecting to at most 10 networks directly. But what if we need to connect the VM to more than 10 networks? With VLAN-backed networking, this is where Guest VLAN Tagging (GVT) comes in. When Guest VLAN Tagging is enabled on a port group, the VM itself is responsible for inserting VLAN tags (802. 1Q C-TAGs) into the frames it transmits. The virtual switch then uses the tag to direct the frame to the correct VLAN. With this approach, a single vNIC can access up to 4,094 VLAN-backed networks , dramatically increasing connectivity without adding more virtual NICs. Guest VLAN Tagging is enabled by specifying a VLAN ID range on the port group. For example, if you configure a range of 10–20, the vNIC will accept traffic tagged with VLAN IDs from 10 to 20, while dropping traffic tagged with IDs outside that range. The VM’s operating system must, of course, be configured to generate the appropriate VLAN-tagged subinterfaces. Guest VLAN Tagging can also be configured on NSX segments in a similar way, but there is an important difference: NSX segments are not identified by VLAN IDs.</description></item><item><title>The Signal in the Storm: Why Chasing More Data Misses the Point</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-08-29-the-signal-in-the-storm-why-chasing-more-data-misses-the-point/</link><pubDate>Fri, 29 Aug 2025 17:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-08-29-the-signal-in-the-storm-why-chasing-more-data-misses-the-point/</guid><description>Posted on August 29, 2025 by Endre Sara, Co-Founder at Causely CNCF projects highlighted in this post As OpenTelemetry adoption has exploded, so has the volume of telemetry data moving through modern observability pipelines. But despite collecting more logs, metrics, and traces than ever before, teams are still struggling to answer the most basic questions during incidents: What broke? Where? And why? In my recent talk at OpenTelemetry Community Day, “ T he Signal in the Storm: Practical Strategies for Managing Telemetry Overload ,” I laid out a different path forward, one focused not on volume, but on meaning. More telemetry doesn’t guarantee more understanding. In many cases, it gives you the illusion of control while silently eroding your ability to reason about the system. That illusion becomes expensive, especially when telemetry pipelines are optimized for ingestion, not insight. Observability Needs a Better Model Traditional observability relies on emitting and aggregating raw signals (spans, logs, and metrics), then querying across that pile post-hoc. That model assumes the data will be useful after something goes wrong. But today’s distributed, dynamic, multi-tenant AI-driven systems don’t give you that luxury. The cost of collecting all raw signals without semantics and without context is too high. We need a shift: from streams of telemetry to structured, semantic representations of how systems behave. That starts by modeling the actual components of the system (entities) and the relationships between them. Not as metadata bolted onto spans, but as first-class signals.</description></item><item><title>VMware Cloud Foundation – Cloud on Your Terms</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-08-29-vmware-cloud-foundation-cloud-on-your-terms/</link><pubDate>Fri, 29 Aug 2025 16:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-08-29-vmware-cloud-foundation-cloud-on-your-terms/</guid><description>Related Articles VMware Cloud Foundation - Cloud on Your Terms VMware Cloud Services Portal migration to the Broadcom Cloud Console Broadcom and Canonical Partner to Fast-track and Secure Containerized Workload Deployments on VMware Cloud Foundation At Broadcom, we are committed to empowering our customers to build and manage modern private clouds on their own terms.

A very impressive goal, but this purist vision can alienate traditional developers and slow innovation. It’s time to expand the definition, and embrace a broader perspective: AI agents don’t always need to self-learn or chase lofty goals. Functional agents —a new term—that connect large language models (LLMs) to APIs, physical devices, or event-driven systems can be just as impactful. By prioritizing function over form, we enable a broader pool of developers to engage in building AI agents, empower both AI and traditional developers to collaborate, and build practical solutions that drive real-world value. Let’s make progress without always demanding perfection. The traditional definition of an AI agent—rooted in significant AI research—demands autonomy, reasoning, learning, and goal-oriented behavior. These agents, like those powering autonomous vehicles or reinforcement learning models, are impressive but complex. They require deep expertise in machine learning (ML), which can feel like a barrier to traditional developers skilled in APIs, databases, or event-driven architectures. This purist stance risks gatekeeping, sidelining practical agents that don’t learn, but still solve critical problems. Why should an agent that wraps an API call or responds to a sensor be considered inferior? Not every challenge needs a self-evolving neural network—sometimes, a reliable, lightweight solution is enough.</description></item><item><title>Friday Five — August 29, 2025</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-08-29-friday-five-august-29-2025/</link><pubDate>Fri, 29 Aug 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-08-29-friday-five-august-29-2025/</guid><description>Friday Five — August 29, 2025 Edge Industry Review : Orbital data center heads to ISS to test real-time edge computing in space Financial services giant strengthens DR through automation What is AI security?

By applying digital signatures to software artifacts, trust can be established to verify that assets have not been substituted or tampered with through the software development and delivery process. Red Hat Trusted Artifact Signer , a key component of Red Hat’s Trusted Software Supply Chain portfolio , provides a suite of tools that supports signing and verifying assets from first commit to deployment. Since Trusted Artifact Signer was first released, it has been available as a Day-2 operator on Red Hat OpenShift. With the release of version 1.2, you can now also deploy the entire Trusted Artifact Signer suite onto a Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) machine, providing another option for where to run the service. An installation of Trusted Artifact Signer within an RHEL environment will feel familiar to those who have previously deployed the service on OpenShift. Linux containers continue to be the primary delivery vehicle and it relies on the same content source, enabling a consistent experience wherever the service is deployed. One of the goals associated with the design and implementation of Trusted Artifact Signer on RHEL was to include the same core components and to remain as feature-compatible as possible with the existing OpenShift-based deployment. This includes: The entire suite of Trusted Artifact Signer based services, including Fulcio, Rekor, TUF, and a Timestamp Authority The ability to expose each of the services using a set of provided TLS certificates The ability to utilize external instances of MySQL and/or Redis You can also now use Cockpit to monitor the deployment of Trusted Artifact Signer on RHEL. Once enabled, the management of container instances can all be governed within a single console using tooling that is familiar with most RHEL administrators.

This type of deployment is often referred to as air-gapped. Common air-gapped environments include ships, vehicles, aircraft, remote industrial sites, nuclear facilities, and emergency field operations. These are locations where traditional network connectivity is unavailable or undesired, but where critical decision-making, predictive maintenance, resource estimation, safety monitoring, intrusion detection, and anomaly detection are essential. To address the challenges of operating in air-gapped environments (including lack of connectivity, limited hardware resources, manual update procedures, and the need for secure, autonomous systems) where agility in deployment and redeployment is critical, a portable edge zero touch provisioning (ZTP) solution can be adopted. Across various industry use cases, several essential requirements consistently emerge, which can be integrated into the ZTP solution: Self-contained: No dependency on cloud API or external data sources Long-lived: Must run for weeks or months without updates Secure by default: Threat models assume local tampering or sabotage Hardware-aware: Limited compute, storage, power, and rugged devices Manually updatable: Updates over USB, SD cards, or other physical media Network-constrained: Low, intermittent, or no connectivity (GSM, satellite, or fully offline) With common characteristics of air-gapped and resource-constrained environments identified, a portable edge ZTP architecture pattern can now be defined: Immutable infrastructure Description: The system, including operating system and services, is deployed as read-only, signed images.

Your architecture is the key to mastering it. As generative AI (GenAI) becomes foundational to modern software products, developers face a chaotic new reality, juggling different APIs from various providers while also attempting to deploy self-hosted open-source models. This leads to credential sprawl, inconsistent security policies, runaway costs, and an infrastructure that is difficult to scale and govern. Your architecture doesn’t have to be this complex. Platform engineering teams need a secure, scalable way to serve both internal and external LLMs to their users. That’s where tools such as Envoy AI Gateway come in. This reference architecture outlines how to build a flexible GenAI platform using the open source solutions Envoy AI Gateway, KServe, and complementary tools. Whether you’re self-hosting models or integrating with model-serving services on cloud providers, such as OpenAI and Anthropic, this architecture enables a unified, governable interface for LLM traffic.

However, handling diverse security data sources such as software bill of materials (SBOMs), critical vulnerabilities and exploits (CVEs), and vendor advisories remains a major challenge due to inconsistent formats, varying levels of detail, and the lack of standardized integration points. Addressing this challenge requires not only better tools, but also open collaboration across the entire ecosystem, demanding transparency and trust. In an effort to create a more unified and scalable solution for managing security metadata, Red Hat is proud to contribute Trustify to the Graph for Understanding Artifact Composition (GUAC), an Open Source Security Foundation (OpenSSF) incubating project. This contribution reflects Red Hat’s belief that transparent, upstream-first innovation is essential to building security solutions that are more scalable, interoperable, and community-driven. Under the OpenSSF umbrella, end-users will be able to contribute and collaborate to Trustify, helping to grow the project adoption and mature the technology. Trustify is an open source project, developed by Red Hat, that provides a high-performance, searchable backend for software supply chain metadata. It supports SBOM and advisory formats such as SPDX, CycloneDX, and OSV, and is designed for integration into modern continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) workflows. The GUAC open source project aggregates and connects software security metadata into a unified graph. It enables developers and security teams to answer complex questions about software provenance, vulnerability impact, and supply chain integrity at scale. Both Trustify and GUAC are designed to tackle the overwhelming challenge of managing vast amounts of software security data that can lead to unmanageable vulnerability handling for security engineers (also known as “alert fatigue”). While Trustify focuses on providing a single, searchable database for SBOMs, CVEs and advisories, GUAC&amp;rsquo;s strength lies in its ability to normalize data from multiple sources into a rich graph database, providing deeper insights and actionable intelligence.</description></item><item><title>Extreme Performance Series 2025: VMware Cloud Foundation 9.0 in the Hands-On Labs</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-08-27-extreme-performance-series-2025-vmware-cloud-foundation-9-0-in-the-hands-on-labs/</link><pubDate>Wed, 27 Aug 2025 21:29:32 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-08-27-extreme-performance-series-2025-vmware-cloud-foundation-9-0-in-the-hands-on-labs/</guid><description>Related Articles Extreme Performance Series 2025: VMware Cloud Foundation 9.0 in the Hands-On Labs Extreme Performance Series 2025: vSAN ESA vs Traditional Storage Array Extreme Performance Video Blog Series 2025 The Extreme Performance Series is back for 2025!

Containers provide integrated dependency management and enable a standard distribution and deployment model for any workload. With Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (Amazon EKS), Kubernetes has emerged as a go-to solution for customers running large-scale containerized workloads that need to efficiently scale to meet evolving needs. However, one persistent challenge continues to impact specific deployment and scaling aspects of Kubernetes workload operations. Container image pulls, particularly when working with large and complex container images, can directly impact the responsiveness and agility of your systems. With the growth of AI/ML workloads, where we see particularly large images, this directly impacts operations as images may take several minutes to pull and prepare. In our recent Under the Hood post for EKS Ultra Scale Clusters, we briefly touched on our evolving solution for this problem, Seekable OCI (SOCI) Parallel Pull. In this post, we’ll explain how container image pulls work and how they impact deployment and scaling operations, we’ll dive deeper into how SOCI parallel pull works, and finally show how it can help you improve image pull performance with your workloads on Amazon EKS. As average container image sizes have grown in recent years, container startup performance has become a critical element of modern cloud native system performance. Image pull and preparation can account for more than 75% of total startup time for new and scaling workloads. This challenge is particularly acute with the rise of AI/ML workloads on Amazon EKS. These workloads have driven significant growth in container image sizes, where images are commonly tens of gigabytes in size.</description></item><item><title>Metal3.io becomes a CNCF incubating project</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-08-27-metal3-io-becomes-a-cncf-incubating-project/</link><pubDate>Wed, 27 Aug 2025 19:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-08-27-metal3-io-becomes-a-cncf-incubating-project/</guid><description>What is Metal3. io?

While a variety of high level tools like Large Language Models (LLMs) already exist to support generic use cases, many domain specific solutions are either not yet available or come with significant development costs and risks, particularly when targeting more niche problems. This raises an important challenge: how can we avoid building a fragmented AI tooling landscape with limited real world applicability? To truly support the next wave of AI innovation, especially in cloud native environments, we need to rethink and reinforce our software component foundation. This includes standardizing formats, improving cross platform interoperability, and evolving Kubernetes with AI native features in mind. One of the most promising developments in this space revolves around Open Container Initiative (OCI) artifacts. OCI artifacts enable users to store and distribute arbitrary files and metadata using OCI compliant container registries. While originally used for generic purposes (like ORAS supports them), they’re now finding critical roles in AI/ML workflows, especially with the rise of specifications like the CNCF ModelPack. The CNCF ModelPack Specification builds on top of OCI artifacts and aims to standardize the packaging, distribution, and execution of AI models in cloud native environments. By moving away from proprietary formats, ModelPack facilitates reproducibility, portability, and vendor neutrality in machine learning workflows. This opens the door to several important use cases: Standardized AI/ML model packaging : With OCI artifacts, models can be versioned, distributed, and tracked like container images. This promotes consistency and traceability across environments. Secure model delivery : Well established solutions like sigstore signatures offer mechanisms to sign and verify OCI artifacts, improving model integrity and trustworthiness.</description></item><item><title>Simplify Linux management across your systems’ lifecycles with Red Hat Insights</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-08-27-simplify-linux-management-across-your-systems-lifecycles-with-red-hat-insights/</link><pubDate>Wed, 27 Aug 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-08-27-simplify-linux-management-across-your-systems-lifecycles-with-red-hat-insights/</guid><description>Simplify Linux management across your systems’ lifecycles with Red Hat Insights Build more robust systems from the start Move away from a &amp;ldquo;break-fix&amp;rdquo; approach Simplify day-to-day operations About the authors Mary Mackey McKibbin Brady More like this Blog post Blog post Blog post Browse by channel Automation Artificial intelligence Open hybrid cloud Security Edge computing Infrastructure Applications Virtualization Share As a system administrator, keeping a Linux fleet running efficiently and securely can feel like you’re constantly putting out fires. Just when you address one issue, another one pops up, often because of a lack of visibility across your environment and too many manual, repetitive tasks. But what if you could spend less time reacting to problems and more time on the work that drives your business forward? That&amp;rsquo;s why we&amp;rsquo;re committed to building and improving new capabilities in Red Hat Insights for Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) to help you stay ahead of the curve. Insights for RHEL helps you proactively manage your environment across the entire system lifecycle. With exciting new features – some you may have already heard about at Red Hat Summit this past May - you can make better decisions, access targeted information when you need it, and automate repetitive tasks to increase efficiency. Planning for new systems can be difficult when you don&amp;rsquo;t have a clear, centralized view of the future. The new Insights planning for RHEL capability provides a centralized view of future roadmap details, package lifecycle information, and deprecations. This helps you proactively plan system builds, anticipate potential impacts of updates, and align your infrastructure with your long-term strategy. You can build new images with confidence, avoiding last-minute scrambling and unexpected issues. We&amp;rsquo;re also making it easier to create more complete and functional images with package recommendations in image builder. This new feature provides proactive package recommendations based on user inputs and real-world usage patterns, helping you discover valuable components you might otherwise overlook. This is like having a second set of eyes on your work, helping to minimize post-deployment headaches.</description></item><item><title>Use Envoy Gateway as the Unified Ingress Gateway and Waypoint Proxy for Ambient Mesh</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-08-26-use-envoy-gateway-as-the-unified-ingress-gateway-and-waypoint-proxy-for-ambient-/</link><pubDate>Tue, 26 Aug 2025 13:09:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-08-26-use-envoy-gateway-as-the-unified-ingress-gateway-and-waypoint-proxy-for-ambient-/</guid><description>Why use Envoy Gateway with Ambient Mesh? How Envoy Gateway Works in Ambient Mesh? Setting Up Envoy Gateway as the Ingress Gateway Enabling Envoy Gateway as the Waypoint Proxy Should You Use Envoy Gateway with Ambient Mesh? What’s Next? References Posted on August 26, 2025 by Huabing (Robin) Zhao, Software Engineer &amp;amp; Ric Hincapié, DevOps and Support Engineer at Tetrate In this article, we’ll look at how you can use Envoy Gateway , an Envoy project open source solution, together with Istio when running in Ambient mode. This allows you to easily leverage the power of Envoy’s L7 capabilities for Ingress and east-west traffic in your mesh with easy-to-use CRDs. To understand how this integration works, let’s first take a quick look at Ambient Mesh itself. Also known as Istio Ambient mode , it’s a sidecar-less service mesh architecture that aims to simplify deployments and can boost efficiency for specific use cases. Unlike sidecar-based meshes, Ambient splits the data plane into two key components: the ztunnel , which secures service-to-service communication, and the Waypoint Proxy , which handles Layer 7 traffic routing and policy enforcement. On the other side, Envoy Gateway is a Kubernetes-native API gateway built on top of Envoy Proxy. It’s designed to work seamlessly with the Kubernetes Gateway API and takes a batteries-included approach—offering built-in support for authentication, authorization, rate limiting, CORS handling, header manipulation, and more. These capabilities are exposed through familiar Kubernetes-style APIs, letting you fully tap into Envoy’s power without needing complex configurations. Because both Ambient Mesh and Envoy Gateway are built on top of Envoy, they share a common foundation. This makes integration straightforward and allows Envoy Gateway to act as both the Ingress Gateway and Waypoint Proxy —giving you a consistent and powerful way to manage traffic and apply Layer 7 policies across your mesh. While Ambient Mesh simplifies service mesh operations by removing sidecars, its feature set doesn’t yet match the maturity of the sidecar-based model. Some advanced Layer 7 capabilities are either missing, considered experimental, or require extra complexity to configure in native Ambient mode.</description></item><item><title>Broadcom and Canonical Partner to Fast-track and Secure Containerized Workload Deployments on VMware Cloud Foundation</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-08-26-broadcom-and-canonical-partner-to-fast-track-and-secure-containerized-workload-d/</link><pubDate>Tue, 26 Aug 2025 12:35:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-08-26-broadcom-and-canonical-partner-to-fast-track-and-secure-containerized-workload-d/</guid><description>Related Articles Broadcom and Canonical Partner to Fast-track and Secure Containerized Workload Deployments on VMware Cloud Foundation Strengthened Cyber-Risk Management and Compliance for Large-Scale VMware Cloud Foundation Environments Building your GenAI Agents on VCF with Private AI Services A survey on the State of Developers found that most developers spend roughly one day each week tackling development and IT inefficiencies 1.

Related Articles Broadcom and Canonical Partner to Fast-track and Secure Containerized Workload Deployments on VMware Cloud Foundation Strengthened Cyber-Risk Management and Compliance for Large-Scale VMware Cloud Foundation Environments Building your GenAI Agents on VCF with Private AI Services Today at VMware Explore’s general session you saw Chris Wolf demonstrate Intelligent Assist for VMware Cloud Foundation, providing AI-powered assistance for our users. In this blog, we’ll take a step behind the curtain to see how these capabilities are running in VCF, using AI features that our customers can also use to build their own AI experiences with their own private data. VMware Private AI services enable administrators to safely and securely import and share approved AI models (Model Gallery and Model Governance); scale and run Models as a Service for their organization (Model Runtime and ML API gateway); create Knowledge bases and regularly refresh data in a fully supported vector database for creating RAG applications (Data Indexing and Retrieval Service in partnership with Data Services Manager); and provide developers a UI where they can compose models, knowledge bases, and tools together to create Agents (Agent Builder). The Intelligent Assist service is using these capabilities to run the Intelligent Assist agent, and VCF engineering teams are using these services as a common AI platform to deliver joint services and AI workflows. Customers can also use these same capabilities for their own teams. These features give private cloud administrators what they need to safely download, validate, and share models with teams across their cloud. Learn about how to safely onboard popular models from upstream and ensure the model’s behavior meets your enterprises’ expectations and requirements – and behavior doesn’t drift over time in this blog post. Now that you have models securely imported and shared with the right folks in your organization, you will want to run them in an efficient and scalable way. Gone are the days of every division running their own separate copies of the same popular models – instead your team can provide Models as a Service using the Model Runtime. Deploy models on a fully maintained runtime stack from directly within VCF, and then horizontally scale them as they come under load with no end user impact, as users broker their requests via the ML API gateway. This also gives you flexibility to do rolling upgrades of models with zero end user impact. This method of deploying models allows separate lines of business or tenants within a Cloud Service Provider to keep their data separate from each other while ensuring high GPU utilization.</description></item><item><title>Engineering the Next Generation of VMware Cloud Foundation</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-08-26-engineering-the-next-generation-of-vmware-cloud-foundation/</link><pubDate>Tue, 26 Aug 2025 12:30:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-08-26-engineering-the-next-generation-of-vmware-cloud-foundation/</guid><description>VMware Cloud Foundation – The Platform For What’s Next Infrastructure at the Speed of the Developer Private AI as a Service Taking It Further with VCF Advanced Cyber Compliance The Path Forward Related Articles Broadcom and Canonical Partner to Fast-track and Secure Containerized Workload Deployments on VMware Cloud Foundation Strengthened Cyber-Risk Management and Compliance for Large-Scale VMware Cloud Foundation Environments Building your GenAI Agents on VCF with Private AI Services The private cloud is entering a new era. The workloads our infrastructure must serve have shifted from traditional applications only to also include distributed systems, data-intensive analytics, and AI-driven models that demand unprecedented agility and scale. VMware Cloud Foundation (VCF) has always been about giving customers a single, integrated platform to build and operate their private cloud with consistency. But the requirements are evolving—and so must the platform. And VMware Cloud Foundation isn’t just adapting to enterprise transformation – it’s leading it. VCFis the engine driving how modern businesses reimagine their infrastructure, applications, and data strategies. Each new innovation isn’t a reaction to where the industry is going—it sets the pace for what’s possible in the private cloud – whether it’s in a central datacenter, edge or in the hyperscaler environment. VCF 9.0 set the benchmark for the modern private cloud: Sovereign by Design – Data residency tags, geo-fencing, and automated certificate rotation to embed compliance into the platform. Operational Simplicity – New installer, unified fleet management, and streamlined lifecycle operations reduce deployment and maintenance overhead. Modern App Platform – vSphere Kubernetes Service and VM Service deliver VMs and containers side by side with GitOps-driven automation. Performance &amp;amp; Efficiency – NVMe memory tiering and global vSAN deduplication boost scale and flash efficiency at lower cost.

The ever-evolving risks presented by today’s modern threat landscape pose unprecedented challenges that most today are ill-equipped to address. With ransomware attacks becoming increasingly sophisticated and regulatory guidelines more stringent, cyber-risk management and compliance lie at the core of every strategic IT decision made by C-Suite executives and board members. 51% of leaders reported security, data protection and privacy as key priorities to enable compliant operations 1. However, the path to achieve successful outcomes is beset with obstacles. Why Organizations Struggle to Manage Cyber-Risk and Maintain Compliance Reactive vs. Proactive Response: data is scattered across different applications in multiple geographic locations, each with its own rules and regulations. 63% of organizations report that complexity from the disaggregated nature of data as the main challenge to maintain compliance 2. Policy monitoring for virtual machines (VMs), containers, databases, infrastructure and technology stack components is siloed, which hinders early detection of drifts and leads to a reactive versus proactive response. Manual Remediation and Recovery: policy management and recovery lack automation, which directly impacts an organization’s ability to scale operations and preserve compliance as applications are changed, moved or deleted. Intense manual intervention inevitably delays time to audit-readiness and leaves unaddressed gaps that could expose critical workloads to increased damage. Stitching of Multiple Tools: consolidation of cyber-risk management, resilience and recovery is easier said than done. Most organizations rely on a piecemeal approach, plagued with operational complexity and inefficiencies that increase chances of human error.</description></item><item><title>Unleashing the Power of Private AI: New Innovations from Broadcom with NVIDIA</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-08-26-unleashing-the-power-of-private-ai-new-innovations-from-broadcom-with-nvidia/</link><pubDate>Tue, 26 Aug 2025 12:30:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-08-26-unleashing-the-power-of-private-ai-new-innovations-from-broadcom-with-nvidia/</guid><description>VMware Private AI Services Now Included in VCF Subscription New Capabilities Supported now NVIDIA Blackwell Architecture Support Future Releases Enable Privacy and Security Multi-tenant models as a service Simplify Infrastructure Management DirectPath enablement for GPUs with VMware Private AI Foundation with NVIDIA Intelligent Assist with VCF Streamline Model Deployment Model Context Protocol (MCP) High-Speed Networking with Enhanced DirectPath I/O VCF Support for NVIDIA HGX Platform with Blackwell GPUs and NVSwitch VCF Support for NVIDIA HGX B200 New Partners in the VMware Private AI Ecosystem Related Articles Broadcom and Canonical Partner to Fast-track and Secure Containerized Workload Deployments on VMware Cloud Foundation Strengthened Cyber-Risk Management and Compliance for Large-Scale VMware Cloud Foundation Environments Building your GenAI Agents on VCF with Private AI Services Enterprises can get tremendous productivity and business transformation from AI.

Read about the challenges associated with 5G core lifecycle management, software versioning, and its impact on testing and verification. Find out how Red Hat and Rebaca’s autonomous continuous testing framework helps service providers with the consistent delivery of compliant and interoperable 5G core cloud-native network functions (CNFs). Deploying a 5G core network involves several key components, including the Access and Mobility Management Function (AMF) for connection and mobility management, the Session Management Function (SMF) for managing user data sessions, the User Plane Function (UPF) for service delivery, the Network Repository Function (NRF) for service discovery, and the Policy Control Function (PCF) for policy enforcement among others. A significant challenge for telecommunication (telco) service providers is the management of different software versions of these network functions, especially in a multivendor environment. A particular version may include new features, bug fixes, or require specific configurations. Consequently, testing of the network functions is complex, going beyond the verification of each component&amp;rsquo;s functionality to ensure that various versions of these network functions can interoperate. Dealing with this complexity necessitates extensive testing automation to guarantee streamlined operations across the service provider’s network. Adopting a cloud-native design for the 5G core gives service providers a competitive edge in building networks that easily scale and adapt. A distributed and disaggregated 5G core network introduces additional challenges, particularly around ensuring that all the different components can work together. As 5G core cloud-native network functions (CNFs) are made up of microservices that are constantly being updated and deployed in a dynamic environment, keeping tabs on security and adherence to standards becomes an overwhelming task. To ensure that all independently developed components of the 5G core operate effectively, the various network functions within the 5G core must interoperate efficiently, adhering to 3GPP standards.</description></item><item><title>What’s New in Calico – Summer 2025</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-08-25-what-s-new-in-calico-summer-2025/</link><pubDate>Mon, 25 Aug 2025 22:17:49 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-08-25-what-s-new-in-calico-summer-2025/</guid><description>Security at Scale with a Unified Platform Calico Ingress Gateway with Integrated WAF Granular Dashboard access with new RBAC and UI enhancements Simplified Operations for Kubernetes, VM, and bare metal workloads Policy Recommendations Now Available in Calico Cloud Free Tier Centralized log forwarding for VM and bare metal hosts Improved visualization of VM and bare metal hosts in Calico Service Graph Summary As Kubernetes adoption scales across enterprise architectures, platform architects face mounting pressure to implement consistent security guardrails across distributed, multi-cluster environments while maintaining operational velocity. Modern infrastructure demands a security architecture that can adapt without introducing complexity or performance penalties. Traditional approaches force architects to cobble together separate solutions for ingress protection, network policies, and application-layer security, creating operational friction and increasing attack surface. Today, we’re announcing significant enhancements to Calico that eliminate this architectural complexity. This release introduces native Web Application Firewall (WAF) capabilities integrated directly into Calico’s Ingress Gateway, enabling platform architects to deploy a single technology stack for both ingress management and HTTP-layer threat protection. Combined with enhanced Role-Based Access Controls (RBAC) controls, and centralized observability across heterogeneous workloads, platform architects can now design and implement comprehensive security all within a unified platform. The new features in this release can be grouped under two main categories: Security at Scale with a Unified Platform: This release introduces critical security features that make it easier to secure and scale Kubernetes workloads. Simplified Operations for Kubernetes, VM, and bare metal workloads: Reducing complexity is key to scaling Kubernetes, VM, and bare metal workloads, and this release introduces features that make security management more automated and scalable. Ingress traffic into a Kubernetes cluster is a common entry point for attacks, so it’s critical to inspect and proactively secure it. Since clusters often receive traffic directly from the public internet, analyzing application-layer protocols like HTTP and gRPC for threats is a fundamental security requirement. While there are options to deploy a standalone Web Application Firewall (WAF) with your ingress controller, using an integrated WAF simplifies operations and can reduce both complexity and cost. Calico Ingress Gateway , our implementation of the Kubernetes Gateway API, now includes a built-in WAF that allows you to inspect, authorize, and secure ingress traffic at runtime.</description></item><item><title>Extreme Performance Series 2025: vSAN ESA vs Traditional Storage Array</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-08-25-extreme-performance-series-2025-vsan-esa-vs-traditional-storage-array/</link><pubDate>Mon, 25 Aug 2025 20:34:53 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-08-25-extreme-performance-series-2025-vsan-esa-vs-traditional-storage-array/</guid><description>Related Articles Extreme Performance Series 2025: VMware Cloud Foundation 9.0 in the Hands-On Labs Extreme Performance Series 2025: vSAN ESA vs Traditional Storage Array Extreme Performance Video Blog Series 2025 The Extreme Performance Series is back for 2025!

My project focused on understanding how Prometheus handles OpenTelemetry resource attributes and how that experience could be improved for users. My job was to conduct user research to get the user perspective on this challenge. In three months, I conducted user and stakeholder interviews, ran a survey, and analyzed the findings. In this article, I’ll share how I conducted the research, what I uncovered and where the communities involved could go from here. OpenTelemetry (OTel) has something called a resource attribute, which is extra information about the source of a metric, like the service, host, or environment that generated it. Prometheus, a time-series database, uses labels to identify and query metrics. If resource attributes are converted to labels, they can cause what’s known as “a cardinality explosion”, essentially creating too many unique combinations that overwhelm the system. This usually happens if the attributes change often or include a lot of unique values, like user IDs or pod names. Currently, there are three main approaches to handling this challenge: Map all resource attributes to labels: This creates cardinality explosion problems, especially for applications with large numbers of attributes or frequently changing attribute values. Selective promotion: Users manually choose which resource attributes are important enough to be converted to labels in Prometheus. Target info pattern: Put all resource attributes in a separate metric called target_info.</description></item><item><title>VCF Breakroom Chats Episode 56: FinOps in VMware Cloud Foundation</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-08-25-vcf-breakroom-chats-episode-56-finops-in-vmware-cloud-foundation/</link><pubDate>Mon, 25 Aug 2025 04:32:39 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-08-25-vcf-breakroom-chats-episode-56-finops-in-vmware-cloud-foundation/</guid><description>Related Articles Broadcom and Canonical Partner to Fast-track and Secure Containerized Workload Deployments on VMware Cloud Foundation Strengthened Cyber-Risk Management and Compliance for Large-Scale VMware Cloud Foundation Environments Building your GenAI Agents on VCF with Private AI Services Welcome to the next episode of the VCF Breakroom Chats.

Military organizations are increasingly operating across a hybrid infrastructure, spanning the strategic core, deployed edge, and tactical edge, while maintaining absolute control over their systems. However, this evolution presents significant challenges, from siloed technologies to cybersecurity threats. Defence organizations must navigate these obstacles by adopting a unified platform approach, leveraging an open framework based on open standards to strengthen autonomy, security, and seamless operations across all environments. Traditionally, defence operations began in the strategic core, which were large, on-premise data centers disconnected from the internet. These handled everything from mission planning to logistics. The first wave of transformation introduced private cloud solutions, allowing military organizations to scale infrastructure dynamically while maintaining digital sovereignty. Many defence entities remain cautious about using the public cloud due to security concerns, opting instead for air-gapped private clouds—physically isolated environments within their facilities—so only screened personnel and verified secure networks have access. Today, the focus has shifted to edge computing, highlighting the need for smarter, real-time, and autonomous decision-making in the field. Defence organizations now operate across two key edge environments, the deployed edge and the tactical edge. The deployed edge consists of mini data centres, capable of running mission-critical applications, processing intelligence and supporting AI workloads. Meanwhile, the tactical edge encompasses lightweight, ruggedized devices such as drones, autonomous vehicles, and soldier-worn systems that can collect, analyse, and act on data in real time, often completely disconnected from central networks.</description></item><item><title>How I Team Up with GenAI to Craft Conference Talk Proposals</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-08-22-how-i-team-up-with-genai-to-craft-conference-talk-proposals/</link><pubDate>Fri, 22 Aug 2025 20:09:07 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-08-22-how-i-team-up-with-genai-to-craft-conference-talk-proposals/</guid><description>An Incomplete List of GenAI Tells My Process Step One: Brainstorm Buddy Step Two: Shape the Story Step Three: Write the Abstract Prompt 1: Brainstorm Buddy Prompt 2: Shape the Story Prompt 3: Write the Abstract Enjoy the Result!

References Posted on August 22, 2025 by Whitney Lee, CNCF Ambassador and Senior Technical Advocate at Datadog TL;DR: GenAI can help you write conference abstracts, but if you use it without injecting your own curiosity and humanness, reviewers can tell. This post walks through my personal process for co-writing abstracts with GenAI in a way that preserves my voice and experience. I developed this process for technical talks, but it adapts well to other formats too. I’ve spoken at a lot of conferences, big and small. I’ve given keynotes. Breakouts. Workshops. I’ve been around the block and written many conference talk proposals. I’ve also been on program committees and reviewed others’ proposals. There’s always room for improvement, but I like to think I know what good is. In my view, here are some elements of a good talk proposal: – A clear, engaging idea (or a run-of-the-mill idea with a compelling angle) – Some clear details about the talk, like concrete examples or stories, or talk format and tools covered – Clear audience – Clear takeaways As you can imagine, the widespread use of GenAI to generate talk proposals has changed the game for both submitters and reviewers. As a submitter, you can type just one line into ChatGPT, for example: Write me a KubeCon + CloudNativeCon talk abstract on Validating Admission Policy And it produces something that, on the surface, looks pretty good!* Title: Enforcing What Matters: Building Safer Kubernetes with Validating Admission Policies Abstract: As Kubernetes adoption continues to grow across organizations, ensuring workloads meet security, compliance, and operational standards before hitting the cluster is more critical than ever.</description></item><item><title>Virtually Speaking Podcast: Explore Las Vegas 2025 Preview</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-08-22-virtually-speaking-podcast-explore-las-vegas-2025-preview/</link><pubDate>Fri, 22 Aug 2025 14:20:04 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-08-22-virtually-speaking-podcast-explore-las-vegas-2025-preview/</guid><description>Get ready for VMware Explore 2025 in Las Vegas!

Driving this technological evolution within DenizBank is Intertech, DenizBank&amp;rsquo;s IT subsidiary, which has played a key role in redefining what&amp;rsquo;s possible in banking. Before this modernization, DenizBank&amp;rsquo;s data science teams faced significant hurdles that hindered their ability to innovate quickly. Their workflows were characterized by: Manual and inflexible environments : Over 120 data scientists were using a Virtual Desktop Infrastructure (VDI) for model development. This VDI-based environment was not only slow and resource-intensive, but it also made lifecycle management of continuously changing Python libraries incredibly difficult. It forced them to rely on cumbersome digital workstations where each new model required a complex, manual setup. A lack of standardization : Without a unified platform, consistency was a major issue. Data access methods, model environments, database integrations, and code repositories varied from one data scientist to another, making collaboration and management difficult. Slow time-to-market and deployment : The manual processes created a development bottleneck. It was also taking a significant amount of time to decide which model to deploy, as business teams struggled to understand and compare which models performed better.

The assessment phase involves evaluating technical feasibility for Amazon EKS workloads, analyzing current Kubernetes environments, identifying compatibility issues, estimating costs, and determining timelines with business impact considerations. During the mobilize phase, organizations create detailed migration plans, establish EKS environments with proper networking and security, train teams, and develop testing procedures. The final migrate and modernize phase involves transferring applications and data, validating functionality, implementing cloud-centered features, optimizing resources and costs, and enhancing observability to fully use AWS capabilities. One of the most significant challenges organizations face during the process is cost estimation, which happens in the assessment phase. Karpenter is an open source Kubernetes node autoscaler that efficiently provisions just-in-time compute resources to match workload demands. Unlike traditional autoscalers, Karpenter directly integrates with cloud providers to make intelligent, real-time decisions about instance types, availability zones, and capacity options. It evaluates pod requirements and constraints to select optimal instances, considering factors such as CPU, memory, price, and availability. Karpenter can consolidate workloads for cost efficiency and rapidly scale from zero to handle sudden demand spikes. It supports both spot and on-demand instances, and automatically terminates nodes when they’re no longer needed, optimizing cluster resource utilization and reducing cloud costs. Karpenter uses the concept of Providers to interact with different infrastructure platforms for provisioning and managing compute resources. KWOK (Kubernetes WithOut Kubelet) is a toolkit that simulates data plane nodes without allocating actual infrastructure, and can be used as a provider to create lightweight testing environments that enable developers to validate provisioning decisions, try various (virtual) instance types, and debug scaling behaviors.</description></item><item><title>Stop Building SaaS from Scratch: Meet the SeaNotes Starter Kit</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-08-21-stop-building-saas-from-scratch-meet-the-seanotes-starter-kit/</link><pubDate>Thu, 21 Aug 2025 14:20:21 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-08-21-stop-building-saas-from-scratch-meet-the-seanotes-starter-kit/</guid><description>Stop Building SaaS from Scratch: Meet the SeaNotes Starter Kit What is SeaNotes?

This week, the founders and core team behind Styra announced that they are joining Apple. I first met the Styra team at KubeCon 2017 in Austin, when Brian Grant saw an early demo of what we were building, and suggested that I talk to them. Although we have significantly different approaches to PaC, one of my favorite moments at each KubeCon since has been catching up with folks from Styra and exchanging notes on the space. We here at Nirmata, want to take a moment to recognize and thank the entire Styra team – their founders Teemu, Tim, Torin, along with Anders, Charlie and many others – for their pioneering work. Without their vision and drive, there would be no PaC ecosystem as we know it today. At Nirmata, we know that Kyverno’s journey, and our own, would not have been possible without the foundation laid by the OPA community. The early adoption of OPA proved the need for declarative policies and automated governance. It set the standard for how organizations think about declarative policies across cloud and infrastructure environments and it will continue to play an important role in the CNCF landscape. We are also encouraged that the Styra team has found a great home at Apple. With such a strong technology leader supporting them, the OPA community can look forward to ongoing innovation, stability, and new opportunities for growth. We are excited to see what comes next in the OPA roadmap and how the project continues to evolve as a critical part of the cloud native landscape.</description></item><item><title>Announcing OpenAI gpt-oss Models on the DigitalOcean Gradient™ AI Platform</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-08-20-announcing-openai-gpt-oss-models-on-the-digitalocean-gradient-ai-platform/</link><pubDate>Wed, 20 Aug 2025 16:21:33 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-08-20-announcing-openai-gpt-oss-models-on-the-digitalocean-gradient-ai-platform/</guid><description>Announcing OpenAI gpt-oss Models on the DigitalOcean Gradientâ¢ AI Platform Whatâs new How to get started What you can build Deploy now About the author Try DigitalOcean for free Related Articles Build smarter AI agents: new tools now available for the DigitalOcean Gradientâ¢ AI Platform Introducing GPU Droplets accelerated by NVIDIA HGX H200 Now Live: GPT-5 on the DigitalOcean Gradientâ¢ AI Platform By Grace Morgan Updated: August 20, 2025 2 min read OpenAIâs first open-source GPT models (20b and 120b) are now available on the Gradient AI Platform.

Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform | Product Trial About the author Derrick Sutherland More like this Blog post Blog post Blog post Keep exploring Browse by channel Automation Artificial intelligence Open hybrid cloud Security Edge computing Infrastructure Applications Virtualization Share The biggest challenge for disaster recovery in traditional environments is that every environment looks and feels different. If you&amp;rsquo;re moving from a colo that someone manages to VMware, the cloud, or a different VMware data center, they all look and feel different. Even if you&amp;rsquo;re using the same virtualization provider, storage is probably handled differently. There has to be a lot of planning and strategy around how to copy data from one area to another since that’s not something natively built into your virtualization provider. You also have to figure out networking, DNS, routing, etc. With Red Hat OpenShift , all of these components are software-defined. You get software-defined DNS, networking, and storage layers all because it’s based on Kubernetes. Out-of-the-box OpenShift won’t “automagically” failover without additional levels of configuration, much like VMware or other traditional infrastructure environments. But the tools required are mostly there for you, either pre-packaged and open-source or robustly tested and a standard in the space.</description></item><item><title>Tuning Linux Swap for Kubernetes: A Deep Dive</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-08-19-tuning-linux-swap-for-kubernetes-a-deep-dive/</link><pubDate>Tue, 19 Aug 2025 10:30:00 -0800</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-08-19-tuning-linux-swap-for-kubernetes-a-deep-dive/</guid><description>Tuning Linux Swap for Kubernetes: A Deep Dive Introduction to Linux swap Anonymous vs File-backed memory Key kernel parameters for swap tuning Swap tests and results Test setup Test methodology Findings Risks and recommendations Kubernetes context Recommended starting point The Kubernetes NodeSwap feature , likely to graduate to stable in the upcoming Kubernetes v1.34 release, allows swap usage: a significant shift from the conventional practice of disabling swap for performance predictability. This article focuses exclusively on tuning swap on Linux nodes, where this feature is available. By allowing Linux nodes to use secondary storage for additional virtual memory when physical RAM is exhausted, node swap support aims to improve resource utilization and reduce out-of-memory (OOM) kills. However, enabling swap is not a &amp;ldquo;turn-key&amp;rdquo; solution. The performance and stability of your nodes under memory pressure are critically dependent on a set of Linux kernel parameters. Misconfiguration can lead to performance degradation and interfere with Kubelet&amp;rsquo;s eviction logic. In this blogpost, I&amp;rsquo;ll dive into critical Linux kernel parameters that govern swap behavior. I will explore how these parameters influence Kubernetes workload performance, swap utilization, and crucial eviction mechanisms. I will present various test results showcasing the impact of different configurations, and share my findings on achieving optimal settings for stable and high-performing Kubernetes clusters. At a high level, the Linux kernel manages memory through pages, typically 4KiB in size. When physical memory becomes constrained, the kernel&amp;rsquo;s page replacement algorithm decides which pages to move to swap space. While the exact logic is a sophisticated optimization, this decision-making process is influenced by certain key factors: Page access patterns (how recently pages are accessed) Page dirtyness (whether pages have been modified) Memory pressure (how urgently the system needs free memory) It is important to understand that not all memory pages are the same.</description></item><item><title>Introducing langchain-gradient: Seamless LangChain Integration with DigitalOcean Gradient™ AI Platform</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-08-19-introducing-langchain-gradient-seamless-langchain-integration-with-digitalocean-/</link><pubDate>Tue, 19 Aug 2025 17:37:45 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-08-19-introducing-langchain-gradient-seamless-langchain-integration-with-digitalocean-/</guid><description>Introducing langchain-gradient: Seamless LangChain Integration with DigitalOcean Gradientâ¢ AI Platform Why langchain-gradient?

This matters because while GenAI can generate content, ideas, or responses, it can’t act on them. However, when combined with Agentic AI, your systems shift from being reactive and prompt-driven to autonomous and outcome-oriented. This article aims to help senior technology leaders better understand the value Agentic AI can add to existing AI infrastructure, while outlining key considerations to determine whether its implementation aligns with your business needs. Image caption: Core components of an Agentic AI Architecture from Markovate. Agentic AI systems are designed to operate autonomously, perceiving their environment, making decisions, and executing actions without continuous human oversight. This autonomy enables businesses to streamline operations, reduce costs, and enhance scalability. The image above illustrates how the following systems function: Perception layer: This layer involves collecting data from various sources i. e. sensors, cameras, microphones, and digital inputs, to understand the current state of the environment. For businesses, this means real-time monitoring of operations, customer interactions, and market trends, facilitating proactive decision-making and rapid response to changing conditions.

Progressive delivery strategies, such as canary deployments, allow organizations to release new features by shifting traffic incrementally between old and new versions of a service. This allows organizations to first release features to a small subset of users, monitor system behavior and performance in real time, and automatically roll back if anomalies are detected. This is particularly valuable in modern microservices environments running on platforms such as Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (Amazon EKS) , where service meshes and traffic routers provide the necessary infrastructure for fine-grained control over traffic routing. This post explores an architectural approach to implementing progressive delivery using Amazon VPC Lattice, Amazon CloudWatch Synthetics , and Argo Rollouts. The solution uses VPC Lattice for enhanced traffic control across microservices, CloudWatch Synthetics for real-time health and validation monitoring, and Argo Rollouts for orchestrating canary updates. The content in this post addresses readers who are already familiar with networking constructs on Amazon Web Services (AWS), such as Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon VPC) , CloudWatch Synthetics and Amazon EKS. Instead of defining these services, we focus on their capabilities and integration with VPC Lattice. We also build upon your existing understanding of VPC Lattice concepts and Argo Rollouts. For more background on Amazon VPC Lattice, we recommend that you review the post, Build secure multi-account multi-VPC connectivity for your applications with Amazon VPC Lattice , and the collection of resources in the VPC Lattice Getting started guide. The architecture integrates multiple AWS services and Kubernetes-native components, providing a comprehensive solution for progressive delivery: Amazon EKS : A fully managed Kubernetes service to host microservices. VPC Lattice : A service networking layer that enables consistent traffic routing, authentication, and observability across services.</description></item><item><title>Red Hat Named a Leader in 2025 Gartner® Magic Quadrant™ for Container Management for the Third Consecutive Year</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-08-11-red-hat-named-a-leader-in-2025-gartner-magic-quadrant-for-container-management-f/</link><pubDate>Mon, 11 Aug 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-08-11-red-hat-named-a-leader-in-2025-gartner-magic-quadrant-for-container-management-f/</guid><description>Red Hat Named a Leader in 2025 Gartner® Magic Quadrant™ for Container Management for the Third Consecutive Year What is the Gartner Magic Quadrant?

In this post, we guide you through integrating Tailscale with your Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS) Hybrid Nodes environment. Amazon EKS Hybrid Nodes is a feature of Amazon EKS that enables you to streamline your Kubernetes management by connecting on-premises and edge infrastructure to an EKS cluster running in Amazon Web Services (AWS). This unified approach allows AWS to manage the Kubernetes control plane in the cloud while you maintain your hybrid nodes in on-premises or edge locations. We demonstrate how to configure a remote pod network and node address space. Install Tailscale on your hybrid nodes, set up a subnet router within your Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon VPC) , and update your AWS routes accordingly. This integration provides direct, encrypted connections that streamline the network architecture needed for EKS Hybrid Nodes. Although EKS Hybrid Nodes streamlines the Kubernetes management challenge, network connectivity between your on-premises infrastructure and AWS remains a critical requirement. Tailscale can help streamline this network connectivity between your EKS Hybrid Nodes data plane and Amazon EKS Kubernetes control plane. Unlike traditional VPNs, which tunnel all network traffic through a central gateway server, Tailscale creates a peer-to-peer mesh network (known as a tailnet ). It enables encrypted point-to-point connections using the open source WireGuard protocol, connecting devices and services across different networks with enhanced security features. However, you can still use Tailscale like a traditional VPN.</description></item><item><title>How 1&amp;1 Mail &amp; Media Scaled Kubernetes Networking with eBPF and Calico</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-08-05-how-1-1-mail-media-scaled-kubernetes-networking-with-ebpf-and-calico/</link><pubDate>Tue, 05 Aug 2025 16:12:16 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-08-05-how-1-1-mail-media-scaled-kubernetes-networking-with-ebpf-and-calico/</guid><description>Challenge Solution Results What’s Next “We started in 2017 with Calico and never regretted it!” —Stephan Fudeus, Product Owner/Lead Architect, 1&amp;amp;1 Mail &amp;amp; Media 1&amp;amp;1 Mail &amp;amp; Media, part of the United Internet, powers popular European internet brands including GMX and Web. de, serving more than 50% of Germany’s population with critical identity and email infrastructure. With roughly 45 to 50 million users, network reliability is non-negotiable. Any downtime could affect millions. By 2022, the company had containerized 80% of its workloads on Kubernetes across three self-managed data centers. While the platform, backed by bare metal nodes and custom network layers, was highly scalable, network throughput bottlenecks began to emerge. Pods were limited to 2.5 Gbps of bandwidth due to IP encapsulation overhead, despite 10 Gbps network interfaces. The team needed a solution that: Improved pod-to-pod network performance Maintained strong network policy isolation across up to 40 tenants per cluster Scaled to millions of network connections and 1.4 million HTTP requests per second 1&amp;amp;1 Mail &amp;amp; Media had adopted Calico back in 2017, largely for its unique Kubernetes NetworkPolicy standard support. As their Kubernetes platform evolved, with clusters scaling to 300 bare metal nodes, 16,000 pods, and over 4 million conntrack entries, the team turned to Calico’s eBPF data plane to unlock performance gains. Following successful initial trials of eBPF in development and integration environments, the team moved forward with production migrations in 2023. While early versions of Calico on older Linux kernel versions presented some limitations, these challenges were quickly addressed with proactive collaboration between the Calico maintainers and the team. The Calico team introduced key improvements such as auto-scaling of connection tracking tables, which enhanced resilience under load.</description></item><item><title>Introducing OpenShift Service Mesh 3.1</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-08-05-introducing-openshift-service-mesh-3-1/</link><pubDate>Tue, 05 Aug 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-08-05-introducing-openshift-service-mesh-3-1/</guid><description>Introducing OpenShift Service Mesh 3.1 Upgrading to OpenShift Service Mesh 3.1 Kubernetes Gateway API support in OCP 4.19+ Generally available dual-stack support for x86 clusters Moving to UBI Micro containers Toward a sidecar-less service mesh: Istio&amp;rsquo;s ambient mode Kiali updates Mesh Page Updates Performance and scalability with large meshes Get started with OpenShift Service Mesh Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform | Product Trial About the author Jamie Longmuir More like this Blog post Blog post Blog post Keep exploring Browse by channel Automation Artificial intelligence Open hybrid cloud Security Edge computing Infrastructure Applications Virtualization Share Red Hat OpenShift Service Mesh 3.1 has been released and is included with the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform and Red Hat OpenShift Platform Plus. Based on the Istio, Envoy, and Kiali projects, this release updates the version of Istio to 1.26 and Kiali to 2.11 , and is supported on OpenShift Container Platform 4.16 and above. This is the first minor release following Red Hat OpenShift Service Mesh 3.0, a major update to converge OpenShift Service Mesh with the community Istio project, with installation and management using the Sail operator. This change helps ensure that OpenShift Service Mesh can offer the latest stable Istio features with Red Hat support. If you are running OpenShift Service Mesh 2.6 or earlier releases, you must upgrade to OpenShift Service Mesh 3.0 before upgrading to 3.1. We recommend migrating to OpenShift Service Mesh 3.0 promptly, because version 2.6 reaches its end of life on March 12, 2026. An in-depth migration guide is provided in the OpenShift Service Mesh 3.0 documentation , including an analysis of the differences between OpenShift Service Mesh 2.6 and 3.0. We&amp;rsquo;ve also recently published an article that describes how to use the Kiali console for migrating between OpenShift Service Mesh 2.6 and 3.0. For an example of OpenShift Service Mesh 3.0 in action, with fully configured metrics and the Kiali console, see this solution pattern. Kubernetes Gateway API is the next generation of Kubernetes Ingress, load balancer, and service mesh APIs. Istio plans to make it the default set of APIs for creating and managing traffic using a service mesh, and it is required for using Istio&amp;rsquo;s ambient mode. Note that there are no plans to remove the stable Istio APIs, such as VirtualService, DestinationRule, and others.</description></item><item><title>Top 5 Kubernetes Network Issues You Can Catch Early with Calico Whisker</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-07-29-top-5-kubernetes-network-issues-you-can-catch-early-with-calico-whisker/</link><pubDate>Tue, 29 Jul 2025 18:54:43 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-07-29-top-5-kubernetes-network-issues-you-can-catch-early-with-calico-whisker/</guid><description>&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Policy Misconfigurations 2. Misconfigured ServiceAccount Trust Boundaries 3. Asymmetric or One-Sided Flow Patterns 4. Traffic to “Private Network” Destinations Without Explicit Source Policies 5. Zombie Connections and Stale Pod Traffic 🧠 Bonus: Why Whisker Stands Apart from Traditional Logs 🧪 Ready to Try It? Kubernetes networking is deceptively simple on the surface, until it breaks, silently leaks data, or opens the door to a full-cluster compromise. As modern workloads become more distributed and ephemeral, traditional logging and metrics just can’t keep up with the complexity of cloud-native traffic flows. That’s where Calico Whisker comes in. Whisker is a lightweight Kubernetes-native observability tool created by Tigera. It offers deep insights into real-time traffic flow patterns, without requiring you to deploy heavyweight service meshes or packet sniffer. And here’s something you won’t get anywhere else: Whisker is data plane-agnostic. Whether you run Calico eBPF data plane, nftables, or iptables, you’ll get the same high-fidelity flow logs with consistent fields, format, and visibility.&lt;/li&gt;

The following list highlights some of the notable enhancements likely to be included in the v1.34 release, but is not an exhaustive list of all planned changes. This is not a commitment and the release content is subject to change. Dynamic Resource Allocation (DRA) provides a flexible way to categorize, request, and use devices like GPUs or custom hardware in your Kubernetes cluster. Since the v1.30 release, DRA has been based around claiming devices using structured parameters that are opaque to the core of Kubernetes. The relevant enhancement proposal, KEP-4381 , took inspiration from dynamic provisioning for storage volumes.

It gives us the ability to spin up a virtual data center in minutes, scaling infrastructure with ease. But with great power comes great complexities, and in the case of Kubernetes, that complexity is security. By default, Kubernetes permits all traffic between workloads in a cluster. This “allow by default” stance is convenient during development, and testing but it’s dangerous in production. It’s up to DevOps, DevSecOps, and cloud platform teams to lock things down. To improve the security posture of a Kubernetes cluster, we can use microsegmentation , a practice that limits each workload’s network reach so it can only talk to the specific resources it needs. This is an essential security method in today’s cloud-native environments. We all understand that network policies can achieve microsegmentation; or in other words, it can divide our Kubernetes network model into isolated pieces. This is important since Kubernetes is usually used to provide multiple teams with their infrastructural needs or host multiple workloads for different tenants. With that, you would think network policies are first citizens of clusters. However, when we dig into implementing them, three operational challenges make most practitioners reluctant about implementing policies.</description></item><item><title>Scaling beyond IPv4: integrating IPv6 Amazon EKS clusters into existing Istio Service Mesh</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-07-22-scaling-beyond-ipv4-integrating-ipv6-amazon-eks-clusters-into-existing-istio-ser/</link><pubDate>Tue, 22 Jul 2025 18:54:25 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-07-22-scaling-beyond-ipv4-integrating-ipv6-amazon-eks-clusters-into-existing-istio-ser/</guid><description>Scaling beyond IPv4: integrating IPv6 Amazon EKS clusters into existing Istio Service Mesh Amazon EKS IPv6 interoperability with IPv4 in Istio Service Mesh Solution overview Istio Multi-Primary Multicluster deployment model on a single network Istio Multi-Primary Multicluster deployment model on multi-network Walkthrough Initial setup Conclusion About the authors Organizations are increasingly adopting IPv6 for their Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (Amazon EKS) deployments, driven by three key factors: depletion of private IPv4 addresses, the need to streamline or eliminate overlay networks, and improved network security requirements on Amazon Web Services (AWS). In IPv6-enabled EKS clusters, each pod receives a unique IPv6 address from the Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon VPC) IPv6 range, with seamless compatibility facilitated by the Amazon EKS VPC Container Network Interface (CNI). This solution effectively addresses two major IPv4 limitations: the scarcity of private addresses and the security vulnerabilities created by overlapping IPv4 spaces that need Network Address Translation (NAT) at the node level. When transitioning to IPv6, you likely need to run both IPv4 and IPv6 EKS clusters simultaneously. This is particularly important for organizations using Istio Service Mesh with Amazon EKS, because IPv6 clusters must integrate with the existing Service Mesh and work smoothly alongside IPv4 clusters. To streamline this transition, you can configure your Istio Service Mesh to support both your current IPv4 EKS clusters and your new IPv6 EKS clusters. If Istio Service Mesh isn’t part of your infrastructure, then we suggest exploring Amazon VPC Lattice as an alternative solution to speed up your IPv6 implementation on AWS. This post provides a step-by-step guide for combining IPv6-enabled EKS clusters with your existing Istio Service Mesh and IPv4 workloads, enabling a graceful transition to IPv6 on AWS. This guide covers detailed instructions for enabling communication between IPv6 and IPv4 EKS clusters, along with recommended practices for implementing IPv6 across both single and multiple VPC configurations. The functionality of Amazon EKS IPv6 builds on the native dual-stack capabilities of VPC. When you enable IPv6 in your VPC, it receives both IPv4 prefixes and a /56 IPv6 prefix. This IPv6 prefix can come from three sources: Amazon’s Global Unicast Address (GUA) space, your own IPv6 range (BYOIPv6), or a Unique Local Address (ULA) space.</description></item><item><title>Four Powerful, New Features to Help You Build and Deploy More Efficient Apps On DigitalOcean Kubernetes</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-07-22-four-powerful-new-features-to-help-you-build-and-deploy-more-efficient-apps-on-d/</link><pubDate>Tue, 22 Jul 2025 16:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-07-22-four-powerful-new-features-to-help-you-build-and-deploy-more-efficient-apps-on-d/</guid><description>Four Powerful, New Features to Help You Build and Deploy More Efficient Apps On DigitalOcean Kubernetes DigitalOcean Managed Kubernetes support for new GPU Droplets types Nodepool Scale-to-zero DigitalOcean Kubernetes now available in our new, AI-optimized Atlanta data center (ATL1) DigitalOcean Kubernetes Routing Agent now generally available (GA) Get started About the author Try DigitalOcean for free Related Articles Announcing OpenAI gpt-oss Models on the DigitalOcean Gradientâ¢ AI Platform Build smarter AI agents: new tools now available for the DigitalOcean Gradientâ¢ AI Platform Introducing GPU Droplets accelerated by NVIDIA HGX H200 By Nicole Ghalwash Published: July 22, 2025 4 min read Weâre adding to Marchâs updates with even more Managed Kubernetes features that will help you get even more utility out of the productâincluding newly supported Droplet types, the ability to automatically scale nodes to zero when youâre not using them, and more.

EKS Hybrid Nodes provides you with the flexibility to run your containerized applications wherever needed, while maintaining standardized Kubernetes management practices and addressing latency, compliance, and data residency needs. EKS Hybrid Nodes accelerates infrastructure modernization by repurposing existing hardware investments. Organizations can harness the elastic scalability, high availability, and fully managed advantages of Amazon EKS, while making sure of operational consistency through unified workflows and toolsets across hybrid environments. One of the key aspects of the EKS Hybrid Nodes solution is the hybrid network architecture between the cloud-based Amazon EKS control plane and your on-premises nodes. This post dives deep into the cluster networking configurations, guiding you through the process of integrating an EKS cluster with hybrid nodes in your existing infrastructure. In this walkthrough, we set up different Container Network Interface (CNI) options and load balancing solutions on EKS Hybrid Nodes to meet your networking requirements. EKS Hybrid Nodes needs private network connectivity between the cloud-hosted Amazon EKS control plane and the hybrid nodes running in your on-premises environment. This connectivity can be established using either Amazon Web Services (AWS) Direct Connect or AWS Site-to-Site VPN , through an AWS Transit Gateway or the Virtual Private Gateway into your Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon VPC). For an optimal experience, AWS recommends reliable network connectivity with at least 100 Mbps bandwidth, and a maximum of 200ms round-trip latency, for hybrid nodes connecting to the AWS Region. This is general guidance rather than a strict requirement, and specific bandwidth and latency requirements may differ based on the quantity of hybrid nodes and your application’s unique characteristics. The node and pod Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR) blocks for your hybrid nodes and container workloads must be within the IPv4 RFC-1918 ranges.</description></item><item><title>Democratizing AI Model Training on Kubernetes: Introducing Kubeflow Trainer V2</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-07-21-democratizing-ai-model-training-on-kubernetes-introducing-kubeflow-trainer-v2/</link><pubDate>Mon, 21 Jul 2025 00:00:00 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-07-21-democratizing-ai-model-training-on-kubernetes-introducing-kubeflow-trainer-v2/</guid><description>Background and Evolution User Personas Python SDK Simplified API Extensibility and Pipeline Framework LLMs Fine-Tuning Support Dataset and Model Initializers Use of JobSet API Kueue Integration MPI Support Gang-Scheduling Fault Tolerance Improvements What’s Next?

Migration from Training Operator v1 Resources and Community Running machine learning workloads on Kubernetes can be challenging. Distributed training and LLMs fine-tuning, in particular, involves managing multiple nodes, GPUs, large datasets, and fault tolerance, which often requires deep Kubernetes knowledge. The Kubeflow Trainer v2 (KF Trainer) was created to hide this complexity, by abstracting Kubernetes from AI Practitioners and providing the easiest, most scalable way to run distributed PyTorch jobs. The main goals of Kubeflow Trainer v2 include: Make AI/ML workloads easier to manage at scale Provide a Pythonic interface to train models Deliver the easiest and most scalable PyTorch distributed training on Kubernetes Add built-in support for fine-tuning large language models Abstract Kubernetes complexity from AI Practitioners Consolidate efforts between Kubernetes Batch WG and Kubeflow community We’re deeply grateful to all contributors and community members who made the Trainer v2 possible with their hard work and valuable feedback. We’d like to give special recognition to andreyvelich , tenzen-y , electronic-waste , astefanutti , ironicbo , mahdikhashan , kramaranya , harshal292004 , akshaychitneni , chenyi015 and the rest of the contributors. We would also like to highlight ahg-g , kannon92 , and vsoch whose feedback was essential while we designed the Kubeflow Trainer architecture together with the Batch WG. See the full contributor list for everyone who helped make this release possible. Kubeflow Trainer v2 represents the next evolution of the Kubeflow Training Operator , building on over seven years of experience running ML workloads on Kubernetes. The journey began in 2017 when the Kubeflow project introduced TFJob to orchestrate TensorFlow training on Kubernetes. At that time, Kubernetes lacked many of the advanced batch processing features needed for distributed ML training, so the community had to implement these capabilities from scratch. Over the years, the project expanded to support multiple ML frameworks including PyTorch , MXNet , MPI , and XGBoost through various specialized operators.

Today, Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (Amazon EKS) announced support for clusters with up to 100,000 nodes. With Amazon EC2’s new generation accelerated computing instance types, this translates to 1. 6 million AWS Trainium chips or 800,000 NVIDIA GPUs in a single Kubernetes cluster. This unlocks ultra scale artificial intelligence (AI) and machine leaning (ML) workloads such as state-of-the-art model training, fine-tuning and agentic inference. Besides customers directly consuming Amazon EKS today, these improvements also extend to other AI/ML services like Amazon SageMaker HyperPod with EKS that leverage EKS as their compute layer, advancing AWS’s overall ultra scale computing capabilities. Our customers have made it clear that containerization of training jobs and operators such as Kubeflow, the ability to streamline resource provisioning and lifecycle through projects like Karpenter, support for pluggable scheduling strategies, and access to a vast ecosystem of cloud-native tools is critical for their success in the AI/ML domain. Kubernetes has emerged as a key enabler here due to its powerful and extensible API model along with robust container orchestration capabilities, allowing accelerated workloads to scale quickly and run reliably. Through multiple technical innovations, architectural improvements and open-source collaboration, Amazon EKS has built the next generation of its cluster control plane and data plane for ultra scale, with full Kubernetes conformance. At AWS, we recommend customers running general-purpose applications with low coupling and horizontal scalability to follow a cell-based architecture as the strategy to sustain growth.</description></item><item><title>Amazon EKS enables ultra scale AI/ML workloads with support for 100K nodes per cluster</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-07-16-amazon-eks-enables-ultra-scale-ai-ml-workloads-with-support-for-100k-nodes-per-c/</link><pubDate>Wed, 16 Jul 2025 00:14:26 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-07-16-amazon-eks-enables-ultra-scale-ai-ml-workloads-with-support-for-100k-nodes-per-c/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Open the original post ↗ &lt;a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/containers/amazon-eks-enables-ultra-scale-ai-ml-workloads-with-support-for-100k-nodes-per-cluster/"&gt;https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/containers/amazon-eks-enables-ultra-scale-ai-ml-workloads-with-support-for-100k-nodes-per-cluster/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Dry Run: Your Kubernetes network policies with Calico staged network policies</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-07-15-dry-run-your-kubernetes-network-policies-with-calico-staged-network-policies/</link><pubDate>Tue, 15 Jul 2025 14:01:01 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-07-15-dry-run-your-kubernetes-network-policies-with-calico-staged-network-policies/</guid><description>Impact Resolution Let’s Set the Scene The Power of Staged Network Policies Where to Observe Staged Policies? Go Even Further With Calico Cloud Free Tier Outcome Kubernetes Network Policies (KNP) are powerful resources that help secure and isolate workloads in a cluster. By defining what traffic is allowed to and from specific pods, KNPs provide the foundation for zero-trust networking and least-privilege access in cloud-native environments. But there’s a problem: KNPs are risky, and applying them without a clear game plan can be potentially disruptive. Without deep insight into existing traffic flows, applying a restrictive policy can instantly break connectivity killing live workloads, user sessions, or critical app dependencies. An even scarier scenario is when we implement policies that we think cover everything and workloads actually work, but after a restart or scaling operation we hit new problems. Kubernetes, with all of its features, has no built-in “dry run” mode for policies, and no first-class observability to show what would be blocked or allowed which is the right decision since Kubernetes is an orchestrator not an implementer. This forces platform teams into a difficult choice, deploy permissive or no policies and weaken security, or Risk service disruption while debugging restrictive ones. As a result, many teams delay implementing network policies entirely only to regret it after a zero-day exploit like Log4Shell, XZ backdoor, or other vulnerabilities that can impact production. The fear of breaking something becomes the top reason why Kubernetes environments go unsegmented. You can’t enforce what you can’t test safely. For instance, let’s say you want to secure a workload deployed by another team. You don’t control how it was configured.</description></item><item><title>Nirmata Teams Dashboard Gets a Makeover: A Cleaner, Smarter Experience for Managing Kubernetes and Cloud Environments</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-07-15-nirmata-teams-dashboard-gets-a-makeover-a-cleaner-smarter-experience-for-managin/</link><pubDate>Tue, 15 Jul 2025 08:00:09 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-07-15-nirmata-teams-dashboard-gets-a-makeover-a-cleaner-smarter-experience-for-managin/</guid><description>Nirmata Teams Dashboard Gets a Makeover: A Cleaner, Smarter Experience for Managing Kubernetes and Cloud Environments What’s New in the Teams Dashboard? Redesigned Team Cards Better Visibility Into Policy Assignments Pagination for Better Performance Redesigned Team Details Page Major UI Cleanup New Tabbed Layout Smarter Member Management Why It Matters We’re excited to announce a refreshed Teams Dashboard in Nirmata Control Hub. This redesign delivers a cleaner, more intuitive interface that not only looks better, it works better too. Whether you’re managing a few teams or dozens, the new dashboard streamlines how you view and interact with team-related data across your Kubernetes and cloud environments. To improve visibility and team-level accountability, the dashboard now shows how infrastructure resources are allocated across teams. You can easily see which Kubernetes clusters, namespaces, and repositories belong to each team – such as Security, Platform, or Development – and who the team members are. This makes it simpler to understand team footprints, manage access, and align infrastructure usage with organizational structure. Team cards have been completely redesigned with a cleaner layout that makes key information immediately visible. Each card now includes: Total Members in the team Total Clusters assigned Total Namespaces assigned Total Repositories assigned This update gives you a high-level snapshot of your teams’ footprint across your infrastructure , helping you stay informed at a glance. We’ve improved how policy report assignments are surfaced on each team card, offering better visibility and preparing the groundwork for even more powerful insights and statistics in future releases. Instead of listing all teams on one long scroll, we now paginate the dashboard. You’ll see 12 teams at a time, making navigation faster and more manageable, especially for larger organizations. We’ve also made significant improvements to the Team Details page, focusing on clarity and ease of use.</description></item><item><title>What Is Kubernetes?

By keeping infrastructure and cost management simple, the Hatch program enables startups to build tech solutions that make an impact. For Georgi Petrov and Mihail Stoychev, the co-founders and serial entrepreneurs behind Uxify , choosing DigitalOcean to host their startupâs infrastructure was a no-brainer. They built their previous ventures NitroPack, SMSBump, and iSenseLabs on DigitalOcean and could trust the platformâs simplicity, reliability, and user experience. When it came time to power Uxifyâs AI-enabled website performance solution and AI agent Uxi, they opted for DigitalOcean again With Hatch program benefits like cloud credits and GPU Droplet discounts, Uxify could focus on building and scaling their underlying AI infrastructure. Uxifyâs story begins over a decade ago with iSenseLabs, an agency that provided services but also built and sold its own products. One of those products was NitroPack, a performance optimization tool designed to help websites load faster. As NitroPack gained traction, the team began seeing possibilities beyond their current solution. Fast forward to 2024, the team behind NitroPack reached a pivotal moment. They began rethinking web performance and userâs perception of site responsivenessâ¦ This new philosophy led them to develop Navigation AI, a performance solution focused on user experience rather than purely technical metrics. Around the same time, NitroPack was acquired by WP Engine. As part of that acquisition, the emerging Navigation AI project was spun out into a new company: Uxify.</description></item><item><title>Sharks of DigitalOcean: Laura Schaffer, VP, Growth</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-07-10-sharks-of-digitalocean-laura-schaffer-vp-growth/</link><pubDate>Thu, 10 Jul 2025 15:25:33 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-07-10-sharks-of-digitalocean-laura-schaffer-vp-growth/</guid><description>Sharks of DigitalOcean: Laura Schaffer, VP, Growth What makes DigitalOcean a unique place to work?

This blog post dives into the challenges of managing failure modes when operating pods with devices in Kubernetes, based on insights from Sergey Kanzhelev and Mrunal Patel&amp;rsquo;s talk at KubeCon NA 2024. You can follow the links to slides and recording. The rise of AI/ML workloads has brought new challenges to Kubernetes. These workloads often rely heavily on specialized hardware, and any device failure can significantly impact performance and lead to frustrating interruptions. As highlighted in the 2024 Llama paper , hardware issues, particularly GPU failures, are a major cause of disruption in AI/ML training. You can also learn how much effort NVIDIA spends on handling devices failures and maintenance in the KubeCon talk by Ryan Hallisey and Piotr Prokop All-Your-GPUs-Are-Belong-to-Us: An Inside Look at NVIDIA&amp;rsquo;s Self-Healing GeForce NOW Infrastructure ( recording ) as they see 19 remediation requests per 1000 nodes a day! We also see data centers offering spot consumption models and overcommit on power, making device failures commonplace and a part of the business model. However, Kubernetes’s view on resources is still very static. The resource is either there or not. And if it is there, the assumption is that it will stay there fully functional - Kubernetes lacks good support for handling full or partial hardware failures. These long-existing assumptions combined with the overall complexity of a setup lead to a variety of failure modes, which we discuss here. Generally, all AI/ML workloads require specialized hardware, have challenging scheduling requirements, and are expensive when idle.</description></item><item><title>A Detailed Look at Calico Cloud Free Tier</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-07-02-a-detailed-look-at-calico-cloud-free-tier/</link><pubDate>Wed, 02 Jul 2025 20:23:35 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-07-02-a-detailed-look-at-calico-cloud-free-tier/</guid><description>Why Calico Cloud Free Tier? What is Calico Cloud Free Tier? Enhanced Observability Simplified Microsegmentation Intuitive Dashboards Intelligent Policy Recommendations Seamless Path to Calico Cloud Free Tier How Calico Cloud Free Tier Enhances Calico Open Source Conclusion As Kubernetes environments grow in scale and complexity, platform teams face increasing pressure to secure workloads without slowing down application delivery. But managing and enforcing network policies in Kubernetes is notoriously difficult—especially when visibility into pod-to-pod communication is limited or nonexistent. Teams are often forced to rely on manual traffic inspection, standalone logs, or trial-and-error policy changes, increasing the risk of misconfiguration and service disruption. Safe policy management and microsegmentation becomes a daunting task without clear knowledge or insight into which services should communicate with each other. In this detailed look, we’ll explore how Calico Cloud Free Tier builds upon Calico Open Source , and helps platform teams visualize traffic with a dynamic service graph, simplifies policy management, and even analyzes actual traffic to recommend policies. Calico Cloud Free Tier is a managed SaaS, no-cost offering that extends the capabilities of Calico Open Source 3.30 and higher to help Kubernetes teams improve network visibility, simplify policy management, and improve security by simplifying microsegmentation. Designed for single-cluster environments, it provides platform engineers and operators with powerful observability and policy management tools. With a seamless onboarding experience for users already running Calico Open Source 3.30 or higher, Calico Cloud Free Tier empowers teams to take control of their Kubernetes traffic—without additional cost or vendor lock-in.

With custom roles, teams can now assign permissions to individuals that are precisely aligned with their operational and security requirements, reinforcing the principle of least privilege. This allows for more precise permission management, which helps to enhance overall infrastructure security by reducing the risk of over-privileged accounts. Custom roles give you full control over who can do what on your projects, improving the overall security of your cloud resources. In this blog post, we will walk through what custom roles are, how they work, key features, when to use them, and how they can help your team. Custom roles are user-defined sets of permissions that allow organizations to tailor access control to their specific needs, beyond whatâs available in predefined roles. In other words, custom roles let you create your own set of permissions instead of relying only on default, predefined roles (like Viewer, Billing Viewer, etc. ) that may not work for you. Now, users can define more detailed custom permissions that target specific resources and needs. For example, a user may only need read access to Droplets, but write access to Kubernetes.

As a platform engineer or administrator, you might look at your cluster or namespace and find hundreds or even thousands of violations. But not all violations are created equal. Some are critical security risks that demand immediate attention, while others are best practices that can be addressed later. The problem? Without clear guidance, most teams end up doing nothing. Not because they don’t care – but because they don’t know where to start. That’s exactly the problem we solve with Violation Summarization and Prioritization in Nirmata Control Hub. With Nirmata Control Hub, you don’t have to dig through pages of findings and all the time spent therein. With a timely glance, you get a summary report for your entire cluster or specific namespaces, showing: Total number of violations Affected namespaces Top security risks Recommended actions Nirmata Control Hub won’t just tell you what’s wrong. We prioritize violations into clear buckets: 🔥 Priority 1: Immediate Attention High-impact misconfigurations that expose your workloads to real risk – fix these ASAP. 🚨 Priority 2: Important but Not Urgent Still important, but can be queued up for your next sprint. ℹ️ Priority 3: Minor / Best Practices Clean-up tasks and optimizations – ideal for long-term hygiene.</description></item><item><title>More resilient, flexible networking for the cloud workloads that matter</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-06-26-more-resilient-flexible-networking-for-the-cloud-workloads-that-matter/</link><pubDate>Thu, 26 Jun 2025 16:50:42 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-06-26-more-resilient-flexible-networking-for-the-cloud-workloads-that-matter/</guid><description>More resilient, flexible networking for the cloud workloads that matter Partner Network Connect now supports high availability and DOKS Reserved IPv6 on Droplets Bring Your Own IP (BYOIP) Public preview Watch the webinar to scale smarter with all Q2 2025 IaaS updates About the author(s) Try DigitalOcean for free Related Articles Announcing OpenAI gpt-oss Models on the DigitalOcean Gradientâ¢ AI Platform Build smarter AI agents: new tools now available for the DigitalOcean Gradientâ¢ AI Platform Introducing GPU Droplets accelerated by NVIDIA HGX H200 By Anantha Ramachandran and Udhay Ravindran Published: June 26, 2025 5 min read Building and scaling cloud infrastructure often means navigating fragile network configurations, unpredictable IP behavior, and rigid networking provider limitations. Whether itâs dealing with flaky multi-cloud connections, scrambling to update IP allow-lists after a restart, or hesitating to migrate workloads due to reputation-bound IPs, these challenges add unnecessary risk and complexity to modern deployments. Weâre excited to announce three new updates designed to simplify cloud networking and enhance deployment flexibility: Partner Network Connect supports high availability and DOKS, general availability of Reserved IPv6 on Droplets, and public preview of Bring Your Own IP (BYOIP). These improvements address real-world infrastructure challenges and are built with simplicity, scalability, and reliability in mind. Multi-cloud architectures are great, until the private links between them become a single point of failure. For teams routing traffic between multiple cloud providers like DigitalOcean, AWS, Microsoft Azure, or Google Cloud Platform, even brief disruptions can stall ML pipelines, gaming platforms, or analytics services. Traditional setups offer limited redundancy, and recovering from outages usually involves manual intervention or rerouting traffic over public networks. High Availability for Partner Network Connect helps solve this by letting you provision redundant links across two separate DigitalOcean gateway routers. Traffic automatically fails over if one link goes down, with no manual steps required and no impact to your customers. With fully managed failover, this update removes operational overhead while helping meet the needs of latency-sensitive or distributed systems. Key benefits include: Automatic failover: Eliminate downtime from single link failures.

This is done by dynamically mapping domain names to IP addresses and matching the egress traffic against these IPs. We have discussed this feature in detail when we introduced the Inline mode for the eBPF data plane in Calico Enterprise 3.20 release! It addresses the latency and performance issues of the various modes used by Calico in iptables/nftables data planes. It is a shame that Calico users who are not yet ready to switch completely to eBPF would miss out on this big DNS policy improvement. Don’t worry! We found a way to port it to iptables to enhance our users’ experience without forcing users to make a huge leap. In Calico Enterprise v3.21, we have extended the Inline DNS policy mode to iptables. In this mode, DNS policies are updated in real time as DNS responses are parsed by eBPF within the data plane, thus improving the performance. In all the existing modes in the iptables data plane, the DNS response packets are sent to Felix – Calico’s userspace agent. It parses the packets and updates the data plane since advanced packet parsing is not feasible with standard iptables rules. However, iptables has an xt_bpf extension which lets us process and match the packets by an eBPF program the same way we do that in the eBPF data plane! xt_bpf An iptables rule that allows it may look something like this: iptables -A INPUT -m bpf –object-pinned /sys/fs/bpf/dns_parser -j ACCEPT The iptables rule calls the eBPF DNS parser program on the response packet and updates the data plane inline. When the client connects for the first time, the policy is enforced without any delays, thus avoiding any retransmits or any impact on application performance. The parser program is the exact same as in the case of the eBPF data plane and is called in the exact spot in which the packets were formerly sent to userspace.</description></item><item><title>Image Compatibility In Cloud Native Environments</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-06-25-image-compatibility-in-cloud-native-environments/</link><pubDate>Wed, 25 Jun 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-06-25-image-compatibility-in-cloud-native-environments/</guid><description>Image Compatibility In Cloud Native Environments The need for image compatibility specification Dependencies between containers and host OS Multi-cloud and hybrid cloud challenges Image compatibility initiative Implementation in Node Feature Discovery Compatibility specification Client implementation for node validation Examples of usage Conclusion Get involved In industries where systems must run very reliably and meet strict performance criteria such as telecommunication, high-performance or AI computing, containerized applications often need specific operating system configuration or hardware presence. It is common practice to require the use of specific versions of the kernel, its configuration, device drivers, or system components. Despite the existence of the Open Container Initiative (OCI) , a governing community to define standards and specifications for container images, there has been a gap in expression of such compatibility requirements. The need to address this issue has led to different proposals and, ultimately, an implementation in Kubernetes&amp;rsquo; Node Feature Discovery (NFD). NFD is an open source Kubernetes project that automatically detects and reports hardware and system features of cluster nodes. This information helps users to schedule workloads on nodes that meet specific system requirements, which is especially useful for applications with strict hardware or operating system dependencies. A container image is built on a base image, which provides a minimal runtime environment, often a stripped-down Linux userland, completely empty or distroless. When an application requires certain features from the host OS, compatibility issues arise. These dependencies can manifest in several ways: Drivers : Host driver versions must match the supported range of a library version inside the container to avoid compatibility problems. Examples include GPUs and network drivers. Libraries or Software : The container must come with a specific version or range of versions for a library or software to run optimally in the environment. Examples from high performance computing are MPI, EFA, or Infiniband.</description></item><item><title>See More, Worry Less: Managed Database Observability, Monitoring, and Hardening Advancements</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-06-24-see-more-worry-less-managed-database-observability-monitoring-and-hardening-adva/</link><pubDate>Tue, 24 Jun 2025 17:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-06-24-see-more-worry-less-managed-database-observability-monitoring-and-hardening-adva/</guid><description>See More, Worry Less: Managed Database Observability, Monitoring, and Hardening Advancements Whatâs new?

What makes Gateway API different? The Ingress Rut The purpose of this blog post Requirements Spin up a Kubernetes Cluster Install Calico with Operator Deploy a Demo Application Enable Calico Ingress Gateway Deploy Gateway API Resources Gateway HTTPRoute SSL Certificate and Automated Certification Process with Cert-Manager Gateway API integration ClusterIssuer Enabling HTTPS using Calico Ingress Gateway Force Redirect to HTTPS Clean up Conclusion If you’ve managed traffic in Kubernetes, you’ve likely navigated the world of Ingress controllers. For years, Ingress has been the standard way of getting our HTTP/S services exposed. But let’s be honest, it often felt like a compromise. We wrestled with controller-specific annotations to unlock critical features, blurred the lines between infrastructure and application concerns, and sometimes wished for richer protocol support or a more standardized approach. This “pile of vendor annotations,” while functional, highlighted the limitations of a standard that struggled to keep pace with the complex demands of modern, multi-team environments and even led to security vulnerabilities. Yes, and it’s a crucial one. The Kubernetes Gateway API isn’t just an Ingress v2; it’s a fundamental redesign, the “future” of Kubernetes ingress, built by the community to address these very challenges head-on. There are three main points that I came across while evaluating GatewayAPI and Ingress controllers: Standardization &amp;amp; Portability: It aims to provide a core, standard way to manage ingress, reducing reliance on vendor-specific hacks and making it easier to switch implementations – change the class, and it should “just work. ” Role-Based Architecture: Its biggest win is arguably the separation of concerns. Infrastructure teams can manage the Gateway (the entry point, TLS, ports), while application teams manage their HTTPRoutes (or TCPRoutes, etc. ), defining where their specific traffic should go.</description></item><item><title>The Definitive Guide to Microservices</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-06-16-the-definitive-guide-to-microservices/</link><pubDate>Mon, 16 Jun 2025 04:23:11 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-06-16-the-definitive-guide-to-microservices/</guid><description>Key Takeaways Understanding Microservices How Microservices Operate Key Components of Microservices Architecture Advantages of Microservices Common Design Patterns in Microservices Challenges and Criticisms of Microservices Microservices vs. Monolithic Architectures Migrating from Monolithic to Microservices Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA) vs. Microservices Real-World Examples and Case Studies Tools and Technologies for Microservices Best Practices for Building Microservices Summary Frequently Asked Questions What are microservices, and how do they differ from monolithic architectures?

In this guide, we will break down what microservices are, how they operate, their advantages, key components, and best practices, offering a comprehensive overview for anyone looking to understand this modern architectural approach. Microservices architecture allows applications to be built as a collection of independent, modular services that enhance scalability and flexibility. Key components of microservices include API gateways, service registries, and individual data stores for each service, which streamline communication and data management. While microservices offer advantages like fault isolation and faster development cycles, they also introduce complexity and require robust tools for management and orchestration. Microservices are an architectural style that organizes an application as a collection of small, independently deployable services. Unlike traditional monolithic architectures, where a single service encapsulates all functionalities, microservices based applications break down applications into individual services, each focusing on a specific business capability. This modularity allows for independent deployment and scaling, making microservice architecture a popular choice for modern applications, particularly when considering internal microservices. One of the key characteristics of microservices is their cloud-native approach. Each service operates independently but is part of a larger application framework, often utilizing cloud resources to ensure scalability and fault tolerance.</description></item><item><title>Blog: Changes to Kubernetes Slack</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-06-16-blog-changes-to-kubernetes-slack/</link><pubDate>Mon, 16 Jun 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-06-16-blog-changes-to-kubernetes-slack/</guid><description>Changes to Kubernetes Slack UPDATE : We’ve received notice from Salesforce that our Slack workspace WILL NOT BE DOWNGRADED on June 20th.

What Is Kubernetes? Finally, a Simple Explanation! This capability ensures your application remains responsive and performs well under varying traffic loads. In this article, we will cover the basics of Kubernetes HPA, how it works, best practices, and a hands-on example to help you master this critical Kubernetes feature. The Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA) automatically adjusts the number of pod replicas in Kubernetes based on CPU and memory metrics, ensuring stable application performance under varying loads. Proper setup of the Metrics Server is essential, as it provides the necessary resource metrics for HPA to make informed scaling decisions; accurate HPA configuration specifies minimum and maximum replicas along with target utilization. Integrating HPA with other autoscalers such as the Vertical Pod Autoscaler (VPA) and Cluster Autoscaler enhances scaling strategies, allowing for efficient resource management and responsiveness to varying application demands. At its core, the Kubernetes Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA) is a Kubernetes resource that automatically adjusts the number of pod replicas based on observed CPU and memory usage metrics. This dynamic adjustment ensures your application maintains stable performance even as traffic fluctuates, making it a critical component for production workloads. Horizontal pod autoscaling HPA operates by continuously monitoring specified metrics and making scaling decisions to match the demand. The HPA utilizes resource metrics like CPU and memory, as well as custom metrics and cpu metrics, to determine the appropriate number of replicas needed. For example, if the average CPU utilization exceeds a predefined threshold, HPA will increase the number of replicas to distribute the load. Conversely, when the demand decreases, HPA reduces the number of replicas, optimizing resource usage and reducing costs. Additionally, the custom metrics api can be leveraged to enhance monitoring capabilities.</description></item><item><title>kubectl logs: How to Get Pod Logs in Kubernetes (With Examples)</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-06-14-kubectl-logs-how-to-get-pod-logs-in-kubernetes-with-examples/</link><pubDate>Sat, 14 Jun 2025 14:09:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-06-14-kubectl-logs-how-to-get-pod-logs-in-kubernetes-with-examples/</guid><description>Prerequisites Create a Pod How to View Pod Logs View Pod logs in real time Fetch a specific number of lines of Pod logs View logs of an exited container Fetch Pod logs from a specific time period Fetch the logs of a specific container in a multi-container Pod Conclusion Exploring System Architecture for DevOps Engineers Why KubeCon India 2025 Meant More to KodeKloud Linux: List Disks Linux: &amp;ldquo;cat&amp;rdquo; Command Linux Made Easy for DevOps Beginners From CFP to Stage: Win Your Tech Talk Slot MCP Explained Simply: How AI Can Actually Do Things Now Still Not Job-Ready After Learning DevOps?

What starts as a manageable cluster or two can quickly balloon into a sprawling, multi-cluster architecture spanning public clouds, private data centers, or a bit of both. And with that growth comes a whole new set of headaches. How do you keep tabs on compliance across wildly different configurations? When a service goes down across multiple clusters, how do you pinpoint the cause amidst the chaos? And what about those hard-to-diagnose latency issues that seem to crop up between regions? The truth is, achieving secure and scalable multi-cluster Kubernetes isn’t about throwing more tools at the problem. It’s about having the right tools and adopting the right best practices. This is where a solution like Calico Cluster Mesh shines, offering those essential capabilities for a seamless multi-cluster experience without the complexity or overhead that you expect with traditional service meshes. So, why are so many organizations finding themselves in this multi-cluster maze? Often, it’s driven by solid business reasons: High Availability and Disaster Recovery: Spreading workloads across multiple regions or clusters means that if one goes down, your users shouldn’t notice. Performance Optimization: Shifting compute resources to take advantage of lower pricing or bringing processing closer to the data at the edge can make a big difference. Regulatory and Compliance Requirements: Sometimes, data simply has to reside in specific geographies. Hybrid Cloud Strategies: The reality is, not everything can or should move to the cloud. A hybrid approach allows organizations to keep sensitive or legacy systems on-premises while still leveraging the flexibility and scalability of public cloud. While these motivations are sound, the challenges that emerge in these multi-cloud environments are remarkably consistent: Inter-cluster communication is a beast.</description></item><item><title>K3s vs K8s: What are the Differences &amp; Use Cases</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-06-10-k3s-vs-k8s-what-are-the-differences-use-cases/</link><pubDate>Tue, 10 Jun 2025 07:48:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-06-10-k3s-vs-k8s-what-are-the-differences-use-cases/</guid><description>What is K8s?

This blog post explores how to build custom event aggregation systems that help engineering teams better understand cluster behavior and troubleshoot issues more effectively. In a Kubernetes cluster, events are generated for various operations - from pod scheduling and container starts to volume mounts and network configurations. While these events are invaluable for debugging and monitoring, several challenges emerge in production environments: Volume : Large clusters can generate thousands of events per minute Retention : Default event retention is limited to one hour Correlation : Related events from different components are not automatically linked Classification : Events lack standardized severity or category classifications Aggregation : Similar events are not automatically grouped To learn more about Events in Kubernetes, read the Event API reference. Consider a production environment with tens of microservices where the users report intermittent transaction failures: Traditional event aggregation process: Engineers are wasting hours sifting through thousands of standalone events spread across namespaces. By the time they look into it, the older events have long since purged, and correlating pod restarts to node-level issues is practically impossible. With its event aggregation in its custom events: The system groups events across resources, instantly surfacing correlation patterns such as volume mount timeouts before pod restarts. History indicates it occurred during past record traffic spikes, highlighting a storage scalability issue in minutes rather than hours. The beneﬁt of this approach is that organizations that implement it commonly cut down their troubleshooting time significantly along with increasing the reliability of systems by detecting patterns early. This post explores how to build a custom event aggregation system that addresses these challenges, aligned to Kubernetes best practices. I&amp;rsquo;ve picked the Go programming language for my example. This event aggregation system consists of three main components: Event Watcher : Monitors the Kubernetes API for new events Event Processor : Processes, categorizes, and correlates events Storage Backend : Stores processed events for longer retention Here&amp;rsquo;s a sketch for how to implement the event watcher: package main import ( &amp;ldquo;context&amp;rdquo; metav1 &amp;ldquo;k8s.</description></item><item><title>Introducing Serverless Inference on the GenAI Platform</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-06-09-introducing-serverless-inference-on-the-genai-platform/</link><pubDate>Mon, 09 Jun 2025 17:48:18 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-06-09-introducing-serverless-inference-on-the-genai-platform/</guid><description>Introducing Serverless Inference on the GenAI Platform A simpler way to integrate AI Ideal use cases Start building today About the author Try DigitalOcean for free Related Articles Announcing OpenAI gpt-oss Models on the DigitalOcean Gradientâ¢ AI Platform Build smarter AI agents: new tools now available for the DigitalOcean Gradientâ¢ AI Platform Introducing GPU Droplets accelerated by NVIDIA HGX H200 By Grace Morgan Updated: June 9, 2025 2 min read DigitalOceanâs GenAI Platform is now DigitalOcean Gradient Platform.

What Is Kubernetes? Finally, a Simple Explanation! Since its debut in 2014, Kubernetes has seen a meteoric rise in its adoption and popularity. Despite being a relatively new technology, it is now used by a vast number of organizations, from small start-ups to large enterprises, so much so that it has become a standard in the industry. Kubernetes benefits from strong community support and boasts a rich ecosystem of tools and extensions. It is continuously being developed and improved, and judging by the current trends, Kubernetes is only going to get stronger in the future. In this blog post, we’ll discuss why you should consider using Kubernetes , scenarios where Kubernetes might not be the ideal solution, and explore some of its alternatives. Let’s get started! Kubernetes offers several key features that cater to a wide range of application deployment and management needs. Here are the top three features of Kubernetes that make it particularly suitable for modern software development: In recent years, the microservices approach ( where software systems are developed as a collection of small, independent services ) has become increasingly popular in software development. Kubernetes provides many abstractions and APIs that are particularly well-suited to the requirements and characteristics of a microservices architecture. Here&amp;rsquo;s how Kubernetes simplifies the deployment and management of microservices: Containerization support : Kubernetes is designed to manage containers, which are ideal for microservices. Each microservice can be packaged into its own container, encapsulating its dependencies and runtime environment. This makes it easy to deploy and manage microservices consistently and reliably.</description></item><item><title>Sharks of DigitalOcean: Ali Munir, Staff Technical Account Manager</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-06-06-sharks-of-digitalocean-ali-munir-staff-technical-account-manager/</link><pubDate>Fri, 06 Jun 2025 04:14:12 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-06-06-sharks-of-digitalocean-ali-munir-staff-technical-account-manager/</guid><description>Sharks of DigitalOcean: Ali Munir, Staff Technical Account Manager Why did you choose DigitalOcean?

Unlike typical short-lived, stateless web requests, LLM inference sessions are often long-running, resource-intensive, and partially stateful. For example, a single GPU-backed model server may keep multiple inference sessions active and maintain in-memory token caches. Traditional load balancers focused on HTTP path or round-robin lack the specialized capabilities needed for these workloads. They also don’t account for model identity or request criticality (e. g. , interactive chat vs. batch jobs). Gateway API Inference Extension was created to address this gap by building on the existing Gateway API , adding inference-specific routing capabilities while retaining the familiar model of Gateways and HTTPRoutes. By adding an inference extension to your existing gateway, you effectively transform it into an Inference Gateway , enabling you to self-host GenAI/LLMs with a “model-as-a-service” mindset. The project’s goal is to improve and standardize routing to inference workloads across the ecosystem. Key objectives include enabling model-aware routing, supporting per-request criticalities, facilitating safe model roll-outs, and optimizing load balancing based on real-time model metrics.</description></item><item><title>Is It Time to Migrate?

For years, Ingress has been the standard way of getting HTTP/S services exposed. But let’s be honest, it often felt like a compromise. We wrestled with controller-specific annotations to unlock critical features, blurred the lines between infrastructure and application concerns, this complexity didn’t just make portability more difficult, it sometimes led to security vulnerabilities and other complications. As part of Calico Open Source v3.30 , we have released a free and open source Calico Ingress Gateway that implements a custom built Envoy proxy with the Kubernetes Gateway API standard to help you navigate Ingress complexities with style. This blog post is designed to get you up to speed on why such a change might be the missing link in your environment. The challenge with traditional Ingress wasn’t a lack of effort, since the landscape is full of innovative solutions. However, the problem was the lack of a unified, expressive, and role-aware standard. Existing ingress controllers were capable, implemented advanced features, however at the same time tied you to a specific project/vendor. This meant: Vendor Lock-In: Migrating from one ingress controller to another became a painful exercise in translating a web of custom annotations. Configurations were tied to the implementation, not the intent.</description></item><item><title>Introducing ATL1: DigitalOcean’s new AI-optimized data center in Atlanta</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-06-03-introducing-atl1-digitalocean-s-new-ai-optimized-data-center-in-atlanta/</link><pubDate>Tue, 03 Jun 2025 12:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-06-03-introducing-atl1-digitalocean-s-new-ai-optimized-data-center-in-atlanta/</guid><description>Introducing ATL1: DigitalOceanâs new AI-optimized data center in Atlanta Built to power the future of AI/ML Bringing Cloud and AI infrastructure closer to the Southern U.

We are also pleased to announce that there are already a number of conformant implementations to try, made possible by postponing this blog announcement. Version 1.3.0 of the API was released about a month ago on April 24, 2025. Gateway API v1.3.0 brings a new feature to the Standard channel (Gateway API&amp;rsquo;s GA release channel): percentage-based request mirroring , and introduces three new experimental features: cross-origin resource sharing (CORS) filters, a standardized mechanism for listener and gateway merging, and retry budgets. Also see the full release notes and applaud the v1.3.0 release team next time you see them. Graduation to the Standard channel is a notable achievement for Gateway API features, as inclusion in the Standard release channel denotes a high level of confidence in the API surface and provides guarantees of backward compatibility. Of course, as with any other Kubernetes API, Standard channel features can continue to evolve with backward-compatible additions over time, and we (SIG Network) certainly expect further refinements and improvements in the future. For more information on how all of this works, refer to the Gateway API Versioning Policy. Leads: Lior Lieberman , Jake Bennert GEP-3171: Percentage-Based Request Mirroring Percentage-based request mirroring is an enhancement to the existing support for HTTP request mirroring , which allows HTTP requests to be duplicated to another backend using the RequestMirror filter type. Request mirroring is particularly useful in blue-green deployment. It can be used to assess the impact of request scaling on application performance without impacting responses to clients. The previous mirroring capability worked on all the requests to a backendRef. Percentage-based request mirroring allows users to specify a subset of requests they want to be mirrored, either by percentage or fraction.</description></item><item><title>Leveling Up Policy Enforcement in Kubernetes: A Look at Kyverno 1.14 and CEL</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-05-29-leveling-up-policy-enforcement-in-kubernetes-a-look-at-kyverno-1-14-and-cel/</link><pubDate>Thu, 29 May 2025 17:37:06 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-05-29-leveling-up-policy-enforcement-in-kubernetes-a-look-at-kyverno-1-14-and-cel/</guid><description>Leveling Up Policy Enforcement in Kubernetes: A Look at Kyverno 1.14 and CEL What is Kyverno? Evolving Challenges and the Rise of CEL Introducing New Policy Types in Kyverno 1.14 Validating Policy Image Validating Policy Future Directions Kyverno’s Strengths Recently, Cloud Native Live featured a session diving into the powerful integration of Common Expression Language (CEL) in Kyverno 1.14. Hosted by Eric Durmishi and presented by Kyverno maintainers Mariam Fahmy and Charles Edward, the session introduced exciting new capabilities that enhance Kyverno’s flexibility and consistency as a policy engine for Kubernetes. At its core, Kyverno is a policy engine for Kubernetes. It enables you to define policies for validating, mutating, generating, or verifying images for resources within your cluster. When an API request, like creating a Pod, is sent to the Kubernetes API server, it passes through several stages, including authentication and authorization. Kyverno integrates as an admission webhook. The API request is forwarded to the Kyverno server, which fetches relevant policies, applies them to the resource, and then either accepts or rejects the request based on whether the resource violates the policy. Kyverno also includes components such as the Reports Controller, which generates policy reports to visualize policy results, and a Cleanup Controller, which manages unused resources based on cleanup policies. Traditionally, Kyverno used a single policy type with different rule types nested within it, such as validate, mutate, generate, and verifyImages. Policies could define rules to match or exclude specific resources. For validation, you could use patterns, deny rules, Pod Security subrules, or assertion trees. If a resource violated a policy, Kyverno’s action was determined by the failureAction field, which could be set to enforce (reject the request) or audit (allow the request, generating a warning and a policy report).</description></item><item><title>No More kubectl Commands — Just Talk to Your Kubernetes Cluster in Natural Language</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-05-28-no-more-kubectl-commands-just-talk-to-your-kubernetes-cluster-in-natural-languag/</link><pubDate>Wed, 28 May 2025 17:52:01 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-05-28-no-more-kubectl-commands-just-talk-to-your-kubernetes-cluster-in-natural-languag/</guid><description>Getting Started Install kubectl-ai in Seconds Example 1: Get the Pod Count — Just Ask Example 2: Launch an Nginx Pod in Seconds Example 3: Ask for Nginx Pod Details—No Commands Needed Why This Changes the Game Key Takeaway Exploring System Architecture for DevOps Engineers Why KubeCon India 2025 Meant More to KodeKloud Linux: List Disks Linux: &amp;ldquo;cat&amp;rdquo; Command Linux Made Easy for DevOps Beginners From CFP to Stage: Win Your Tech Talk Slot MCP Explained Simply: How AI Can Actually Do Things Now Still Not Job-Ready After Learning DevOps?

Leveraging multiple technologies for networking and security for in-cluster, ingress, egress, and traffic across clusters creates challenges, including operational complexities and increased costs. For example, to manage ingress traffic for Kubernetes clusters, users cobble together multiple solutions from different providers such as ingress controllers or gateways and load balancers for routing traffic, as well as Web Application Firewalls (WAFs) for enhanced security. Despite the challenges it brings, deploying disparate technologies has been a “necessary evil” for organizations to get all the capabilities needed for holistic Kubernetes networking. Here, we’ll explore challenges this proliferation of tooling introduces, and provide actionable tips for today’s platform and security teams to overcome these issues. The fragmented approach to networking and network security in Kubernetes leads to challenges and inefficiencies, including: Operational overhead: Each technology comes with its own learning curve, setup, configuration, integration, and maintenance requirements. This leads to a challenging user experience. Increased costs: Licensing and operational costs accumulate as more tools are deployed. Scaling challenges: As clusters grow or spread across diverse environments, ensuring consistent and secure networking becomes harder. Security gaps: Disjointed solutions impair visibility and may create security gaps. Troubleshooting issues: Without a single pane of glass, troubleshooting and understanding latency issues across clusters is a common problem operators face. Take managing ingress traffic, and everything that goes with it.</description></item><item><title>What’s New in Calico: Spring 2025</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-05-21-what-s-new-in-calico-spring-2025/</link><pubDate>Wed, 21 May 2025 21:52:07 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-05-21-what-s-new-in-calico-spring-2025/</guid><description>Introducing Calico Cloud Free Tier Why Calico Cloud Free Tier?

The launch of ChatGPT was a seminal moment in the evolution of AI, and since then, AIâs adoption has accelerated. According to â The rapid adoption of Generative AI. Bick, Blandin, &amp;amp; Deming (2024 )â, AI is being adopted at twice the rate of the PC and internet at a similar point in their evolution. Not just adoption, the rate of innovation in AI has been faster than anything we have seen before. So where is AI headed? To answer this question, let us start by looking at how other transformational technologies have evolved throughout history. Take the Internet for example â it started with the infrastructure - with routers and network switches. But the true inflection point came with the emergence of platform capabilities, such as web browsers and HTML, which allowed people to build and use applications like search engines, e-commerce, and social media. If you look at the PC, microprocessors and memory and other infrastructure components came first. But what triggered the massive adoption was the creation of a platform â WinTel, which provided a standardized environment for developing and running PC applications. Same with the smartphones; the infrastructure started first with modems and cell towers, but it really took off when a platform enabled the creation and use of applications. AI will follow a similar IPA ( I nfrastructure -&amp;gt; P latform -&amp;gt; A pplication) model, with the innovation moving from Infrastructure (e.</description></item><item><title>Kubernetes v1.33: In-Place Pod Resize Graduated to Beta</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-05-16-kubernetes-v1-33-in-place-pod-resize-graduated-to-beta/</link><pubDate>Fri, 16 May 2025 10:30:00 -0800</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-05-16-kubernetes-v1-33-in-place-pod-resize-graduated-to-beta/</guid><description>Kubernetes v1.33: In-Place Pod Resize Graduated to Beta What is in-place Pod resize?

Getting started and providing feedback On behalf of the Kubernetes project, I am excited to announce that the in-place Pod resize feature (also known as In-Place Pod Vertical Scaling), first introduced as alpha in Kubernetes v1.27, has graduated to Beta and will be enabled by default in the Kubernetes v1.33 release! This marks a significant milestone in making resource management for Kubernetes workloads more flexible and less disruptive. Traditionally, changing the CPU or memory resources allocated to a container required restarting the Pod. While acceptable for many stateless applications, this could be disruptive for stateful services, batch jobs, or any workloads sensitive to restarts. In-place Pod resizing allows you to change the CPU and memory requests and limits assigned to containers within a running Pod, often without requiring a container restart. Here&amp;rsquo;s the core idea: The spec. containers[&lt;em&gt;]. resources field in a Pod specification now represents the desired resources and is mutable for CPU and memory. spec. containers[&lt;/em&gt;]. resources The status. containerStatuses[*]. resources field reflects the actual resources currently configured on a running container.</description></item><item><title>Announcing etcd v3.6.0</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-05-15-announcing-etcd-v3-6-0/</link><pubDate>Thu, 15 May 2025 16:00:00 -0800</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-05-15-announcing-etcd-v3-6-0/</guid><description>Announcing etcd v3.6.0 Security Features Migration to v3store Downgrade Feature gates livez / readyz checks v3discovery Performance Memory Throughput Breaking changes Peer endpoints no longer serve client requests Clear boundary between etcdctl and etcdutl Critical bug fixes Upgrade issue Testing Platforms Dependencies Dependency bumping guide Core Dependency Updates grpc-gateway@v2 grpc-ecosystem/go-grpc-middleware/providers/prometheus Community etcd Becomes a Kubernetes SIG New contributors, maintainers, and reviewers Introducing the etcd Operator Working Group Future Development This announcement originally appeared on the etcd blog.

In batch workloads, you might want to use leader-follower patterns like MPI , in which the leader controls the execution, including the followers&amp;rsquo; lifecycle. In this case, you might want to mark it as succeeded even if some of the indexes failed. Unfortunately, a leader-follower Kubernetes Job that didn&amp;rsquo;t use a success policy, in most cases, would have to require all Pods to finish successfully for that Job to reach an overall succeeded state. For Kubernetes Jobs, the API allows you to specify the early exit criteria using the. spec. successPolicy field (you can only use the. spec. successPolicy field for an indexed Job ).

Kubernetes v1.33 introduces a few updates to the lifecycle of containers. The Sleep action for container lifecycle hooks now supports a zero sleep duration (feature enabled by default). There is also alpha support for customizing the stop signal sent to containers when they are being terminated. This blog post goes into the details of these new aspects of the container lifecycle, and how you can use them. Kubernetes v1.29 introduced the Sleep action for container PreStop and PostStart Lifecycle hooks. The Sleep action lets your containers pause for a specified duration after the container is started or before it is terminated. This was needed to provide a straightforward way to manage graceful shutdowns. Before the Sleep action, folks used to run the sleep command using the exec action in their container lifecycle hooks. If you wanted to do this you&amp;rsquo;d need to have the binary for the sleep command in your container image. This is difficult if you&amp;rsquo;re using third party images.

With Nirmata Control Hub’s Jira integration, you can automatically or manually create Jira tickets for policy violations directly from the platform. This ensures accountability, reduces MTTR (mean time to resolution), and improves team productivity by embedding policy compliance into your teams’ tools. Every misconfiguration or policy violation is a potential security or compliance risk. However, identifying issues is only the first step. The real value is in closing the loop—from detection to resolution. Traditionally, teams rely on Slack alerts, dashboards, or Excel exports to track violations. But these quickly fall out of sync with what’s happening in the cluster or Git. Hira is where real work happens, and that’s where Nirmata Control Hub (NCH) now meets your team. From any Policy Reports page, users can instantly generate a Jira issue for violations. Simply click “Create Jira Issue” and fill in the ticket details, such as project, title, issue type, priority, and assignee. This creates traceability right at the source of the ossie, whether it;s a misconfigured deployment, a missing securityContext, or a policy deviation.</description></item><item><title>Why Policy as Code is a Game Changer for Platform Engineers</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-05-13-why-policy-as-code-is-a-game-changer-for-platform-engineers/</link><pubDate>Tue, 13 May 2025 20:07:21 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-05-13-why-policy-as-code-is-a-game-changer-for-platform-engineers/</guid><description>Why Policy as Code is a Game Changer for Platform Engineers Empower Developers with Faster Feedback Enable Secure Self-Service Achieve Unprecedented Transparency Boost Efficiency and Scalability Ensure Consistent and Standardized Environments Automate Governance and Security Fortify Your Security Posture Streamline Compliance Effortlessly The Future of Platforms is Policy as Code Explore More About Platform Engineering Trends and Best Practices Platform engineers, let’s talk about a fundamental shift that’s revolutionizing how we build and manage internal developer platforms: Policy as Code (PaC). This isn’t just another buzzword; it’s the key to creating scalable, secure, and efficient operations that empower developers. Let’s dive in! Platform engineers, let’s talk about a fundamental shift that’s revolutionizing how we build and manage internal developer platforms: Policy as Code (PaC). This isn’t just another buzzword; it’s the key to creating scalable, secure, and efficient operations that empower developers. Let’s dive in! Policy as Code drastically improves developer experience. By implementing policy checks early in the development process (“shifting left”), developers get instant feedback on potential issues. This prevents problems from reaching production and reduces mental load, allowing them to focus on innovation, not compliance headaches. Platform engineering is about giving developers self-service capabilities. Infrastructure as Code (IaC) provides automation, but Policy as Code (PaC) provides the critical guardrails. Developers can provision resources and deploy applications within defined “golden paths,” ensuring agility without compromising security or compliance. Policies written as code are stored in version control, creating a clear history of changes. This auditability is essential for troubleshooting and demonstrating compliance.</description></item><item><title>Kubernetes v1.33: Job's Backoff Limit Per Index Goes GA</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-05-13-kubernetes-v1-33-job-s-backoff-limit-per-index-goes-ga/</link><pubDate>Tue, 13 May 2025 10:30:00 -0800</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-05-13-kubernetes-v1-33-job-s-backoff-limit-per-index-goes-ga/</guid><description>Kubernetes v1.33: Job&amp;rsquo;s Backoff Limit Per Index Goes GA About backoff limit per index How backoff limit per index works Example Learn more Get involved In Kubernetes v1.33, the Backoff Limit Per Index feature reaches general availability (GA). This blog describes the Backoff Limit Per Index feature and its benefits. When you run workloads on Kubernetes, you must consider scenarios where Pod failures can affect the completion of your workloads. Ideally, your workload should tolerate transient failures and continue running. To achieve failure tolerance in a Kubernetes Job, you can set the spec. backoffLimit field. This field specifies the total number of tolerated failures. spec. backoffLimit However, for workloads where every index is considered independent, like embarassingly parallel workloads - the spec. backoffLimit field is often not flexible enough. For example, you may choose to run multiple suites of integration tests by representing each suite as an index within an Indexed Job. In that setup, a fast-failing index (test suite) is likely to consume your entire budget for tolerating Pod failures, and you might not be able to run the other indexes.</description></item><item><title>Kubernetes v1.33: Image Pull Policy the way you always thought it worked!</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-05-12-kubernetes-v1-33-image-pull-policy-the-way-you-always-thought-it-worked/</link><pubDate>Mon, 12 May 2025 10:30:00 -0800</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-05-12-kubernetes-v1-33-image-pull-policy-the-way-you-always-thought-it-worked/</guid><description>Kubernetes v1.33: Image Pull Policy the way you always thought it worked!

How to get involved Some things in Kubernetes are surprising, and the way imagePullPolicy behaves might be one of them. Given Kubernetes is all about running pods, it may be peculiar to learn that there has been a caveat to restricting pod access to authenticated images for over 10 years in the form of issue 18787 ! It is an exciting release when you can resolve a ten-year-old issue. imagePullPolicy The gist of the problem is that the imagePullPolicy: IfNotPresent strategy has done precisely what it says, and nothing more. Let&amp;rsquo;s set up a scenario. To begin, Pod A in Namespace X is scheduled to Node 1 and requires image Foo from a private repository. For it&amp;rsquo;s image pull authentication material, the pod references Secret 1 in its imagePullSecrets. Secret 1 contains the necessary credentials to pull from the private repository. The Kubelet will utilize the credentials from Secret 1 as supplied by Pod A and it will pull container image Foo from the registry. This is the intended (and secure) behavior. imagePullPolicy: IfNotPresent imagePullSecrets But now things get curious. If Pod B in Namespace Y happens to also be scheduled to Node 1 , unexpected (and potentially insecure) things happen. Pod B may reference the same private image, specifying the IfNotPresent image pull policy.</description></item><item><title>How to optimize your cloud architecture for business growth</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-05-09-how-to-optimize-your-cloud-architecture-for-business-growth/</link><pubDate>Fri, 09 May 2025 23:25:48 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-05-09-how-to-optimize-your-cloud-architecture-for-business-growth/</guid><description>How to optimize your cloud architecture for business growth How cloud architecture reviews can benefit you Tips to boost cloud performance and security Tips to save money and grow efficiently How DigitalOcean experts help: A real-world example Optimize your cloud to empower your business About the author Try DigitalOcean for free Related Articles Introducing langchain-gradient: Seamless LangChain Integration with DigitalOcean Gradientâ¢ AI Platform Agentic Cloud: Reinventing the Cloud with AI Agents Choosing the Right DigitalOcean Offering for Your AI/ML Workload By Anantha Ramachandran Principal Product Marketing Manager Published: May 9, 2025 5 min read Your cloud setup is like a ship on the ocean.

One of the most challenging aspects of operating large-scale clusters has been handling List requests that fetch substantial datasets - a common operation that could unexpectedly impact your cluster&amp;rsquo;s stability. Today, the Kubernetes community is excited to announce a significant architectural improvement: streaming encoding for List responses. Current API response encoders just serialize an entire response into a single contiguous memory and perform one ResponseWriter. Write call to transmit data to the client. Despite HTTP/2&amp;rsquo;s capability to split responses into smaller frames for transmission, the underlying HTTP server continues to hold the complete response data as a single buffer. Even as individual frames are transmitted to the client, the memory associated with these frames cannot be freed incrementally. When cluster size grows, the single response body can be substantial - like hundreds of megabytes in size. At large scale, the current approach becomes particularly inefficient, as it prevents incremental memory release during transmission. Imagining that when network congestion occurs, that large response body’s memory block stays active for tens of seconds or even minutes. This limitation leads to unnecessarily high and prolonged memory consumption in the kube-apiserver process. If multiple large List requests occur simultaneously, the cumulative memory consumption can escalate rapidly, potentially leading to an Out-of-Memory (OOM) situation that compromises cluster stability.</description></item><item><title>Kubernetes 1.33: Volume Populators Graduate to GA</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-05-08-kubernetes-1-33-volume-populators-graduate-to-ga/</link><pubDate>Thu, 08 May 2025 10:30:00 -0800</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-05-08-kubernetes-1-33-volume-populators-graduate-to-ga/</guid><description>Kubernetes 1.33: Volume Populators Graduate to GA What is new Populator Pod is optional Mutator functions to modify the Kubernetes resources Flexible metric handling for providers Clean up for temporary resources How to use it Future directions and potential feature requests Kubernetes volume populators are now generally available (GA)!

During the beta phase, contributors to Kubernetes identified potential resource leaks with PersistentVolumeClaim (PVC) deletion while volume population was in progress; these leaks happened due to limitations in finalizer handling. Ahead of the graduation to general availability, the Kubernetes project added support to delete temporary resources (PVC prime, etc. ) if the original PVC is deleted. To accommodate this, we&amp;rsquo;ve introduced three new plugin-based functions: PopulateFn() : Executes the provider-specific data population logic.</description></item><item><title>Expanding our GPU Droplet portfolio - NVIDIA RTX 4000 Ada Generation, NVIDIA RTX 6000 Ada Generation, and NVIDIA L40S</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-05-08-expanding-our-gpu-droplet-portfolio-nvidia-rtx-4000-ada-generation-nvidia-rtx-60/</link><pubDate>Thu, 08 May 2025 08:05:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-05-08-expanding-our-gpu-droplet-portfolio-nvidia-rtx-4000-ada-generation-nvidia-rtx-60/</guid><description>Expanding our GPU Droplet portfolio - NVIDIA RTX 4000 Ada Generation, NVIDIA RTX 6000 Ada Generation, and NVIDIA L40S About the author Try DigitalOcean for free Related Articles Announcing OpenAI gpt-oss Models on the DigitalOcean Gradientâ¢ AI Platform Build smarter AI agents: new tools now available for the DigitalOcean Gradientâ¢ AI Platform Introducing GPU Droplets accelerated by NVIDIA HGX H200 By Waverly Swinton Published: May 8, 2025 2 min read GPU Droplets are now DigitalOcean GradientAI GPU Droplets.

By keeping infrastructure and cost management simple, the Hatch program helps enable startups to build solutions that move society forward. Ontra Mobility , a Y Combinator startup, transforms communities by developing data-driven tools that help cities and transit agencies plan and operate more efficient, equitable, and sustainable transportation systems, focusing on optimizing networks and improving first-and-last mile access through on-demand ridesharing. We sat down with CTO Connor Riley, who chose DigitalOcean for its simple, managed infrastructure so they can focus on making public transit more accessible. The Hatch program provided credits and resources that helped support their mission. During their PhD programs at Georgia Institute of Technology, Riley and his co-founder Anthony Trasatti worked with their academic advisor, Pascal Van Hentenryck, to optimize public transit, which serves as a vital lifeline for many. Working closely with MARTA in Atlanta, GA, they developed techniques for network design optimization, special events scheduling, and dispatching algorithms for on-demand ridesharing. These projects powered on-demand ridesharing pilots MARTA Reach and CAT SMART in Savannah, Georgia. Getting adoption for a product that serves public agencies is as much of a battle as building the product itself. Since many residents rely on public transportation, establishing trust with transit agencies is essential before theyâll risk adopting new products that could impact municipal residents. Despite these hurdles, theyâre undeterred: theyâve already gained traction with a number of customers, including conducting a microtransit planning project in Washington D.

Service Account tokens for credential providers 2. Image registry authentication flow Benefits of this approach What&amp;rsquo;s next? Try it out How to get involved Kubernetes has steadily evolved to reduce reliance on long-lived credentials stored in the API. A prime example of this shift is the transition of Kubernetes Service Account (KSA) tokens from long-lived, static tokens to ephemeral, automatically rotated tokens with OpenID Connect (OIDC)-compliant semantics. This advancement enables workloads to securely authenticate with external services without needing persistent secrets. However, one major gap remains: image pull authentication. Today, Kubernetes clusters rely on image pull secrets stored in the API, which are long-lived and difficult to rotate, or on node-level kubelet credential providers, which allow any pod running on a node to access the same credentials. This presents security and operational challenges. To address this, Kubernetes is introducing Service Account Token Integration for Kubelet Credential Providers , now available in alpha. This enhancement allows credential providers to use pod-specific service account tokens to obtain registry credentials, which kubelet can then use for image pulls — eliminating the need for long-lived image pull secrets. Currently, Kubernetes administrators have two primary options for handling private container image pulls: Image pull secrets stored in the Kubernetes API These secrets are often long-lived because they are hard to rotate. They must be explicitly attached to a service account or pod.</description></item><item><title>Do You Need a Degree to Be a DevOps Engineer?

These new roles include the pre-defined roles of â readOnly â, â readWrite â and â dbAdmin â. Learn more about it here. This update brings greater security, efficiency, and compliance to your MongoDB clusters. With predefined roles, you can now easily manage access control, reduce security risks, and streamline database administration across your MongoDB clusters on DigitalOcean. Managing database access can be a challenge, especially as teams grow and security requirements become more complex. Without a structured approach, organizations risk unauthorized access, operational inefficiencies, and compliance gaps. With RBAC now applicable to your MongoDB environment, you can enforce clear, predefined access policiesâhelping to ensure secure, efficient, and scalable database management. Hereâs how RBAC can benefit your business: Enhanced security: RBAC protects against unauthorized access by only allowing verified users to interact with sensitive database resources. This reduces the risk of data breaches and strengthens overall security posture.

How It Works Designed for Developer Velocity and Platform Efficiency Where to Find It What’s Next Every modern enterprise strives for faster software delivery without compromising on security and compliance. As cloud-native environments grow in scale and complexity, so does the burden of identifying and fixing misconfigurations across clusters, pipelines, and cloud infrastructure. Today, we’re excited to announce a major leap forward in our mission to simplify cloud governance: AI-Powered Remediations , which is now available in preview in Nirmata Control Hub (NCH). Security and platform teams often face a growing backlog of policy violations—from missing labels to insecure container configurations to overly permissive network rules. Manually investigating each violation, understanding its root cause, and crafting a compliant fix takes time—and that time adds up. With AI Remediations, we’re dramatically reducing the Mean Time to Remediation (MTTR ). Instead of spending hours chasing down documentation or writing YAML from scratch, teams can now review and apply context-aware fixes in minutes. And the benefits go beyond speed: Dev teams are no longer blocked by vague policy errors. Instead, they receive concrete, explainable suggestions to fix issues early. Platform engineers can spend less time triaging violations and more time building scalable, reliable infrastructure. Security teams have peace of mind knowing issues aren’t just detected—they’re getting resolved faster than ever.

Protect it with Secure AI Mainframes: AI Infrastructure for Next Generation Applications AI and Containerization on the Mainframe Introducing Aqua Secure AI Bringing Aqua Security to IBM Z and IBM LinuxONE Modernize Without Compromise If your AI workloads run in containers, then securing those containers is the first and most important step in protecting your AI. And as enterprises begin to deploy containerized AI workloads on Red Hat OpenShift for mainframe environments, that priority becomes even more urgent. IBM Z and IBM LinuxONE, long trusted to power the world’s most critical business systems are now evolving into innovation hubs, supporting advanced, containerized applications. With this transformation comes a new challenge: securing the infrastructure behind your most sensitive and high-stakes workloads The rise of generative AI and large language models (LLMs) has changed how organizations build and deliver value. From real-time fraud detection to intelligent customer support, AI is becoming embedded in nearly every business function. According to a recent McKinsey study , “ 78 percent of respondents say their organizations use AI in at least one business function, up from 72 percent in early 2024. ” These AI workloads are built and deployed in containers. Why? Containers offer portability, scalability, and efficiency, which makes them ideal for AI training, inference, and everything in between. IDC projects that 1 billion new logical applications will be created by 2028, resulting in more than 10 billion container instances across enterprise environments. These billions of containers won’t just run in a general purpose cloud. They will be deployed on purpose built hardware.</description></item><item><title>Kubernetes v1.33: Prevent PersistentVolume Leaks When Deleting out of Order graduates to GA</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-05-05-kubernetes-v1-33-prevent-persistentvolume-leaks-when-deleting-out-of-order-gradu/</link><pubDate>Mon, 05 May 2025 10:30:00 -0800</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-05-05-kubernetes-v1-33-prevent-persistentvolume-leaks-when-deleting-out-of-order-gradu/</guid><description>Kubernetes v1.33: Prevent PersistentVolume Leaks When Deleting out of Order graduates to GA How did reclaim work in previous Kubernetes releases? PV reclaim policy with Kubernetes v1.33 How does it work? Important note How to enable new behavior? References How do I get involved? I am thrilled to announce that the feature to prevent PersistentVolume (or PVs for short) leaks when deleting out of order has graduated to General Availability (GA) in Kubernetes v1.33! This improvement, initially introduced as a beta feature in Kubernetes v1.31, ensures that your storage resources are properly reclaimed, preventing unwanted leaks. PersistentVolumeClaim (or PVC for short) is a user&amp;rsquo;s request for storage. A PV and PVC are considered Bound if a newly created PV or a matching PV is found. The PVs themselves are backed by volumes allocated by the storage backend. Normally, if the volume is to be deleted, then the expectation is to delete the PVC for a bound PV-PVC pair. However, there are no restrictions on deleting a PV before deleting a PVC. For a Bound PV-PVC pair, the ordering of PV-PVC deletion determines whether the PV reclaim policy is honored. The reclaim policy is honored if the PVC is deleted first; however, if the PV is deleted prior to deleting the PVC, then the reclaim policy is not exercised. As a result of this behavior, the associated storage asset in the external infrastructure is not removed. Bound With the graduation to GA in Kubernetes v1.33, this issue is now resolved. Kubernetes now reliably honors the configured Delete reclaim policy, even when PVs are deleted before their bound PVCs. This is achieved through the use of finalizers, ensuring that the storage backend releases the allocated storage resource as intended.</description></item><item><title>Nirmata Enterprise for Kyverno (N4K) Now Available on AWS Marketplace!</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-05-05-nirmata-enterprise-for-kyverno-n4k-now-available-on-aws-marketplace/</link><pubDate>Mon, 05 May 2025 17:55:11 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-05-05-nirmata-enterprise-for-kyverno-n4k-now-available-on-aws-marketplace/</guid><description>Nirmata Enterprise for Kyverno (N4K) Now Available on AWS Marketplace!

Kubernetes v1.33 introduces an alpha feature called mutable CSI node allocatable count , allowing Container Storage Interface (CSI) drivers to dynamically update the reported maximum number of volumes that a node can handle. This capability significantly enhances the accuracy of pod scheduling decisions and reduces scheduling failures caused by outdated volume capacity information. Traditionally, Kubernetes CSI drivers report a static maximum volume attachment limit when initializing. However, actual attachment capacities can change during a node&amp;rsquo;s lifecycle for various reasons, such as: Manual or external operations attaching/detaching volumes outside of Kubernetes control. Dynamically attached network interfaces or specialized hardware (GPUs, NICs, etc. ) consuming available slots. Multi-driver scenarios, where one CSI driver’s operations affect available capacity reported by another. Static reporting can cause Kubernetes to schedule pods onto nodes that appear to have capacity but don&amp;rsquo;t, leading to pods stuck in a ContainerCreating state. ContainerCreating With the new feature gate MutableCSINodeAllocatableCount , Kubernetes enables CSI drivers to dynamically adjust and report node attachment capacities at runtime. This ensures that the scheduler has the most accurate, up-to-date view of node capacity. MutableCSINodeAllocatableCount When this feature is enabled, Kubernetes supports two mechanisms for updating the reported node volume limits: Periodic Updates: CSI drivers specify an interval to periodically refresh the node&amp;rsquo;s allocatable capacity.</description></item><item><title>Kubernetes v1.33: New features in DRA</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-05-01-kubernetes-v1-33-new-features-in-dra/</link><pubDate>Thu, 01 May 2025 10:30:00 -0800</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-05-01-kubernetes-v1-33-new-features-in-dra/</guid><description>Kubernetes v1.33: New features in DRA Features promoted to beta New alpha features Preparing for general availability What’s next? Getting involved Acknowledgments Kubernetes Dynamic Resource Allocation (DRA) was originally introduced as an alpha feature in the v1.26 release, and then went through a significant redesign for Kubernetes v1.31. The main DRA feature went to beta in v1.32, and the project hopes it will be generally available in Kubernetes v1.34. The basic feature set of DRA provides a far more powerful and flexible API for requesting devices than Device Plugin. And while DRA remains a beta feature for v1.33, the DRA team has been hard at work implementing a number of new features and UX improvements. One feature has been promoted to beta, while a number of new features have been added in alpha. The team has also made progress towards getting DRA ready for GA. Driver-owned Resource Claim Status was promoted to beta. This allows the driver to report driver-specific device status data for each allocated device in a resource claim, which is particularly useful for supporting network devices. Partitionable Devices lets a driver advertise several overlapping logical devices (“partitions”), and the driver can reconfigure the physical device dynamically based on the actual devices allocated. This makes it possible to partition devices on-demand to meet the needs of the workloads and therefore increase the utilization. Device Taints and Tolerations allow devices to be tainted and for workloads to tolerate those taints. This makes it possible for drivers or cluster administrators to mark devices as unavailable.</description></item><item><title>Day 6: ConfigMaps &amp; Secrets — Managing App Settings and Sensitive Data in Kubernetes</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-05-01-day-6-configmaps-secrets-managing-app-settings-and-sensitive-data-in-kubernetes/</link><pubDate>Thu, 01 May 2025 18:11:50 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-05-01-day-6-configmaps-secrets-managing-app-settings-and-sensitive-data-in-kubernetes/</guid><description>Let’s Begin With What You Might Know What’s a ConfigMap?

This feature adds a scoring method for pod scheduling with the topology-aware volume provisioning. This feature eases to schedule pods on nodes with either the most or least available storage capacity. StorageCapacityScoring This feature extends the kube-scheduler&amp;rsquo;s VolumeBinding plugin to perform scoring using node storage capacity information obtained from Storage Capacity. Currently, you can only filter out nodes with insufficient storage capacity. So, you have to use a scheduler extender to achieve storage-capacity-based pod scheduling. This feature is useful for provisioning node-local PVs, which have size limits based on the node&amp;rsquo;s storage capacity. By using this feature, you can assign the PVs to the nodes with the most available storage space so that you can expand the PVs later as much as possible. In another use case, you might want to reduce the number of nodes as much as possible for low operation costs in cloud environments by choosing the least storage capacity node. This feature helps maximize resource utilization by filling up nodes more sequentially, starting with the most utilized nodes first that still have enough storage capacity for the requested volume size. In the alpha phase, StorageCapacityScoring is disabled by default. To use this feature, add StorageCapacityScoring=true to the kube-scheduler command line option &amp;ndash;feature-gates.</description></item><item><title>AI agent development just got easier on GenAI Platform</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-04-30-ai-agent-development-just-got-easier-on-genai-platform/</link><pubDate>Wed, 30 Apr 2025 15:30:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-04-30-ai-agent-development-just-got-easier-on-genai-platform/</guid><description>AI agent development just got easier on GenAI Platform Enhancing your AI agents Build smarter, more transparent AI agents About the author Try DigitalOcean for free Related Articles Announcing OpenAI gpt-oss Models on the DigitalOcean Gradientâ¢ AI Platform Build smarter AI agents: new tools now available for the DigitalOcean Gradientâ¢ AI Platform Introducing GPU Droplets accelerated by NVIDIA HGX H200 By Grace Morgan Published: April 30, 2025 2 min read DigitalOceanâs GenAI Platform is now DigitalOcean Gradient Platform.

What Is Kubernetes? Finally, a Simple Explanation! But here’s the next problem: You try running: kubectl get pods -o wide kubectl get pods -o wide And you see something like: NAME READY STATUS IP NODE myapp-xyz 1/1 Running 10.244.1.5 worker-node-1 NAME READY STATUS IP NODE myapp-xyz 1/1 Running 10.244.1.5 worker-node-1 Great — but: That Pod IP is internal It changes if the Pod dies and restarts And if you have 3 replicas… which IP do you even hit? That’s where Services come in. You can think of it as: A permanent IP address or DNS name inside the cluster A load balancer that routes traffic to the right Pods A gateway between your app and the outside world (if needed) You attach a Service to a set of Pods using labels The Service tracks the matching Pods — even as Pods come and go Kubernetes uses something called kube-proxy to route traffic to the correct Pod behind the scenes So even if Pods restart, the Service endpoint never changes. Let’s say you run 3 Pods of a web app with the label: app: myapp app: myapp You create a Service like this: selector: app: myapp selector: app: myapp Now, when someone accesses the Service: Kubernetes forwards the request to any of the healthy Pods It’s automatic, balanced, and reliable Imagine your app’s Pods are like food trucks moving around a festival ground. A Service is like the signpost that says: You don’t care where the trucks are parked — you just follow the sign. Kubernetes routes you to the right place, even if trucks come and go.

How do I use it? I want all the details! This post describes configurable tolerance for horizontal Pod autoscaling , a new alpha feature first available in Kubernetes 1.33. Horizontal Pod Autoscaling is a well-known Kubernetes feature that allows your workload to automatically resize by adding or removing replicas based on resource utilization. Let&amp;rsquo;s say you have a web application running in a Kubernetes cluster with 50 replicas. You configure the HorizontalPodAutoscaler (HPA) to scale based on CPU utilization, with a target of 75% utilization. Now, imagine that the current CPU utilization across all replicas is 90%, which is higher than the desired 75%. The HPA will calculate the required number of replicas using the formula: In this example: So, the HPA will increase the number of replicas from 50 to 60 to reduce the load on each pod. Similarly, if the CPU utilization were to drop below 75%, the HPA would scale down the number of replicas accordingly. The Kubernetes documentation provides a detailed description of the scaling algorithm. In order to avoid replicas being created or deleted whenever a small metric fluctuation occurs, Kubernetes applies a form of hysteresis: it only changes the number of replicas when the current and desired metric values differ by more than 10%. In the example above, since the ratio between the current and desired metric values is (90/75), or 20% above target, exceeding the 10% tolerance, the scale-up action will proceed. This default tolerance of 10% is cluster-wide; in older Kubernetes releases, it could not be fine-tuned. It&amp;rsquo;s a suitable value for most usage, but too coarse for large deployments, where a 10% tolerance represents tens of pods.</description></item><item><title>Kubernetes v1.33: User Namespaces enabled by default!</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-04-25-kubernetes-v1-33-user-namespaces-enabled-by-default/</link><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 10:30:00 -0800</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-04-25-kubernetes-v1-33-user-namespaces-enabled-by-default/</guid><description>Kubernetes v1.33: User Namespaces enabled by default! What is a user namespace? Demos Everything you wanted to know about user namespaces in Kubernetes Conclusions How do I get involved? In Kubernetes v1.33 support for user namespaces is enabled by default. This means that, when the stack requirements are met, pods can opt-in to use user namespaces. To use the feature there is no need to enable any Kubernetes feature flag anymore! In this blog post we answer some common questions about user namespaces. But, before we dive into that, let&amp;rsquo;s recap what user namespaces are and why they are important. Note: Linux user namespaces are a different concept from Kubernetes namespaces. The former is a Linux kernel feature; the latter is a Kubernetes feature. Linux provides different namespaces to isolate processes from each other. For example, a typical Kubernetes pod runs within a network namespace to isolate the network identity and a PID namespace to isolate the processes. One Linux namespace that was left behind is the user namespace. It isolates the UIDs and GIDs of the containers from the ones on the host. The identifiers in a container can be mapped to identifiers on the host in a way where host and container(s) never end up in overlapping UID/GIDs. Furthermore, the identifiers can be mapped to unprivileged, non-overlapping UIDs and GIDs on the host.</description></item><item><title>Introducing DigitalOcean Managed Caching for Valkey, The New Evolution of Managed Caching</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-04-24-introducing-digitalocean-managed-caching-for-valkey-the-new-evolution-of-managed/</link><pubDate>Thu, 24 Apr 2025 20:16:49 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-04-24-introducing-digitalocean-managed-caching-for-valkey-the-new-evolution-of-managed/</guid><description>Introducing DigitalOcean Managed Caching for Valkey, The New Evolution of Managed Caching Learn more about our new database offering: DigitalOcean Managed Caching for Valkey Benefits and features of Managed Caching for Valkey Where is Managed Caching going?

New Service features like dual-stack networking and traffic distribution are only supported via the EndpointSlice API, so all service proxies, Gateway API implementations, and similar controllers have had to be ported from using Endpoints to using EndpointSlices. At this point, the Endpoints API is really only there to avoid breaking end user workloads and scripts that still make use of it. As of Kubernetes 1.33, the Endpoints API is now officially deprecated, and the API server will return warnings to users who read or write Endpoints resources rather than using EndpointSlices. Eventually, the plan (as documented in KEP-4974 ) is to change the Kubernetes Conformance criteria to no longer require that clusters run the Endpoints controller (which generates Endpoints objects based on Services and Pods), to avoid doing work that is unneeded in most modern-day clusters. Thus, while the Kubernetes deprecation policy means that the Endpoints type itself will probably never completely go away, users who still have workloads or scripts that use the Endpoints API should start migrating them to EndpointSlices. For end users, the biggest change between the Endpoints API and the EndpointSlice API is that while every Service with a selector has exactly 1 Endpoints object (with the same name as the Service), a Service may have any number of EndpointSlices associated with it: selector $ kubectl get endpoints myservice Warning: v1 Endpoints is deprecated in v1.33+; use discovery. k8s. io/v1 EndpointSlice NAME ENDPOINTS AGE myservice 10.180.3.17:443 1h $ kubectl get endpointslice -l kubernetes. io/service-name = myservice NAME ADDRESSTYPE PORTS ENDPOINTS AGE myservice-7vzhx IPv4 443 10.180.3.17 21s myservice-jcv8s IPv6 443 2001:db8:0123::5 21s $ kubectl get endpoints myservice Warning: v1 Endpoints is deprecated in v1.33+; use discovery. k8s. io/v1 EndpointSlice NAME ENDPOINTS AGE myservice 10.180.3.17:443 1h $ kubectl get endpointslice -l kubernetes.</description></item><item><title>DigitalOcean Customers Eligible to Process DORA Workloads</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-04-24-digitalocean-customers-eligible-to-process-dora-workloads/</link><pubDate>Thu, 24 Apr 2025 12:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-04-24-digitalocean-customers-eligible-to-process-dora-workloads/</guid><description>DigitalOcean Customers Eligible to Process DORA Workloads What is DORA?

The consistent delivery of high-quality releases underscores the strength of our development cycle and the vibrant support from our community. This release consists of 64 enhancements. Of those enhancements, 18 have graduated to Stable, 20 are entering Beta, 24 have entered Alpha, and 2 are deprecated or withdrawn. There are also several notable deprecations and removals in this release; make sure to read about those if you already run an older version of Kubernetes. The theme for Kubernetes v1.33 is Octarine: The Color of Magic 1 , inspired by Terry Pratchett’s Discworld series. This release highlights the open source magic 2 that Kubernetes enables across the ecosystem. If you’re familiar with the world of Discworld, you might recognize a small swamp dragon perched atop the tower of the Unseen University, gazing up at the Kubernetes moon above the city of Ankh-Morpork with 64 stars 3 in the background. As Kubernetes moves into its second decade, we celebrate both the wizardry of its maintainers, the curiosity of new contributors, and the collaborative spirit that fuels the project. The v1.33 release is a reminder that, as Pratchett wrote, “It’s still magic even if you know how it’s done. ” Even if you know the ins and outs of the Kubernetes code base, stepping back at the end of the release cycle, you’ll realize that Kubernetes remains magical.</description></item><item><title>What’s Really Happening in Your Containers?

Aqua’s Risk Assessment Has the Answer Beyond the Static: Why Runtime Context Matters Cutting Through the Noise What You’ll Gain from CSRA Built on a Decade of Threat Research A Smarter First Step Get Started Today Containers may be mainstream, but securing them in production remains a moving target. As AI adoption scales and environments grow more complex, so too do the risks, especially at runtime, where traditional tools struggle to provide meaningful visibility. These are not legacy exploits like port scans or brute force attempts. Attackers are targeting what happens inside your environment, at runtime, where misconfigurations, unexpected behaviors, and subtle anomalies can quietly introduce business risk. Yet most security teams are flying blind in production. They have tools that check for vulnerabilities before deployment, scan code for secrets, or assess infrastructure misconfigurations. What they don’t have is visibility into what’s actually happening right now, in the workloads already running in their environment. That’s the gap Aqua is closing with the launch of the Container Security Risk Assessment (CSRA). Security tooling has largely focused on pre-production controls like image scanning, CI/CD pipeline checks, and IaC validation. It is logical, and even easier than runtime. But once containers are running, things change. Configurations drift.</description></item><item><title>Kubernetes Multicontainer Pods: An Overview</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-04-22-kubernetes-multicontainer-pods-an-overview/</link><pubDate>Tue, 22 Apr 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-04-22-kubernetes-multicontainer-pods-an-overview/</guid><description>Kubernetes Multicontainer Pods: An Overview The origins of the sidecar pattern Kubernetes implementation When to embrace (or avoid) sidecars Four essential multi-container patterns Init container pattern Ambassador pattern Configuration helper Adapter pattern Wrap-up As cloud-native architectures continue to evolve, Kubernetes has become the go-to platform for deploying complex, distributed systems. One of the most powerful yet nuanced design patterns in this ecosystem is the sidecar pattern—a technique that allows developers to extend application functionality without diving deep into source code. Think of a sidecar like a trusty companion motorcycle attachment. Historically, IT infrastructures have always used auxiliary services to handle critical tasks. Before containers, we relied on background processes and helper daemons to manage logging, monitoring, and networking. The microservices revolution transformed this approach, making sidecars a structured and intentional architectural choice. With the rise of microservices, the sidecar pattern became more clearly defined, allowing developers to offload specific responsibilities from the main service without altering its code. Service meshes like Istio and Linkerd have popularized sidecar proxies, demonstrating how these companion containers can elegantly handle observability, security, and traffic management in distributed systems. In Kubernetes, sidecar containers operate within the same Pod as the main application, enabling communication and resource sharing. Does this sound just like defining multiple containers along each other inside the Pod? It actually does, and this is how sidecar containers had to be implemented before Kubernetes v1.29.0, which introduced native support for sidecars. Sidecar containers can now be defined within a Pod manifest using the spec. initContainers field.</description></item><item><title>Smarter Knowledge Bases for Smarter AI Agents</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-04-16-smarter-knowledge-bases-for-smarter-ai-agents/</link><pubDate>Wed, 16 Apr 2025 22:09:43 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-04-16-smarter-knowledge-bases-for-smarter-ai-agents/</guid><description>Smarter Knowledge Bases for Smarter AI Agents Web crawling for knowledge bases RAG Improvements Bonus: new Anthropic model availableâClaude 3.7 Unlocking more possibilities for AI developers About the author Try DigitalOcean for free Related Articles Announcing OpenAI gpt-oss Models on the DigitalOcean Gradientâ¢ AI Platform Build smarter AI agents: new tools now available for the DigitalOcean Gradientâ¢ AI Platform Introducing GPU Droplets accelerated by NVIDIA HGX H200 By Grace Morgan Published: April 16, 2025 3 min read Weâre rolling out new features to the GenAI Platform that make it easier to build, manage, and improve the knowledge bases behind your AI agents. With web crawling, custom crawling rules, and one-click reindexing, you can keep your agents up to date with relevant, real-world information, without manual data collection or external storage. Combined with recent enhancements to our Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system, these updates can help your AI agents deliver faster, more accurate, and more context-aware responses from richer, better-organized data sources. The quality of your AI agent output depends on the data it can access. With the new web crawling feature, you can crawl publicly available websites and index content into your knowledge base , reducing the need for manual data collection. This is especially valuable for AI agents that rely on public web content to drive insights and actions. Custom crawling rules let you target specific pages or entire domains, ensuring your agent pulls data from the sites you tell it to. One-click reindexing keeps your knowledge base fresh and up to date, making it ideal for use cases like financial analysis and competitive research. No need for external storage , since crawled content is directly integrated into your knowledge base, simplifying setup and reducing overhead. With web crawling, your AI agent can stay informed by pulling in real-time information. To help your agents make the most of that knowledge, weâve significantly upgraded our Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system.

Conclusion Kubernetes, by default, adopts a permissive networking model where all pods can freely communicate unless explicitly restricted using network policies. While this simplifies application deployment, it introduces significant security risks. Unrestricted network traffic allows workloads to interact with unauthorized destinations, increasing the potential for cyberattacks such as Remote Code Execution (RCE), DNS spoofing, and privilege escalation. To better understand these problems, let’s examine a sample Kubernetes application: ANP Demo App. This application comprises a deployment that spawns pods and a service that exposes them to external users in a similar situation like any real word workload which you will encounter in your environment. If you open the application service before implementing any policies, the application reports the following messages: Container can reach the Internet – Without network policies, an attacker can use our container as an entry point by exploiting it with a vulnerability. This could allow them to exfiltrate data or establish remote control over the workload by leveraging its Internet access. Container can reach CoreDNS Pods – Kubernetes relies heavily on DNS, with records served using CoreDNS Pods. While communication between your Pods and CoreDNS is essential and not inherently a vulnerability, pairing it with unrestricted access to external DNS servers creates a significant security risk such as cluster wide DNS poisoning from a vulnerable pod or a pod with access to NET_RAW capabilities. Container can reach external DNS servers – Without restricting network policies, attackers can leverage techniques such as DNS poisoning, where they manipulate DNS responses to redirect traffic to malicious destinations. Container can reach the Kubernetes API Server – Often overlooked but without network policies all workloads can access the host via local networking addresses, or host sockets. While some applications require these communications, unrestricted access can serve as an escalation entry point for attackers to exploit internal services which are not managed by Kubernetes (e.</description></item><item><title>What's New on the GenAI Platform</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-04-14-what-s-new-on-the-genai-platform/</link><pubDate>Mon, 14 Apr 2025 19:02:28 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-04-14-what-s-new-on-the-genai-platform/</guid><description>What&amp;rsquo;s New on the GenAI Platform About the author Try DigitalOcean for free Related Articles Announcing OpenAI gpt-oss Models on the DigitalOcean Gradientâ¢ AI Platform Build smarter AI agents: new tools now available for the DigitalOcean Gradientâ¢ AI Platform Introducing GPU Droplets accelerated by NVIDIA HGX H200 By Grace Morgan Published: April 14, 2025 1 min read DigitalOceanâs GenAI Platform is now DigitalOcean Gradient Platform.

Aqua U. S. Gov: Built for the Public Sector Helping Public and Private Organizations Move Forward A More Secure Cloud Native Future Starts Here Aqua Security’s Cloud Native Application Protection Platform (CNAPP) has achieved FedRAMP® High Impact Authorization, making Aqua one of the few CNAPP providers authorized at the highest level of federal cloud security compliance. This milestone opens the door for U. S. federal agencies, commercial organizations that require FedRAMP High, and cloud service providers operating in FedRAMP-authorized environments to confidently use Aqua’s platform for securing their cloud native applications. We met more than 400 rigorous security controls, giving federal agencies and commercial organizations the peace of mind that they can adopt cloud native technologies while meeting the highest security standards. FedRAMP (Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program) is a United States government-wide program that standardizes security assessments for cloud products and services. FedRAMP High is the most stringent level, designed for cloud services that manage highly sensitive data related to national security, public health, and other sensitive government functions. Achieving this level of authorization involves an extensive review of security controls, practices, and monitoring processes. The result: confidence that the platform is built to withstand today’s complex cyber threats.

Getting started Getting involved Acknowledgments The Kubernetes Scheduler is a crucial control plane component that determines which node a Pod will run on. Thus, anyone utilizing Kubernetes relies on a scheduler. kube-scheduler-simulator is a simulator for the Kubernetes scheduler, that started as a Google Summer of Code 2021 project developed by me (Kensei Nakada) and later received a lot of contributions. This tool allows users to closely examine the scheduler’s behavior and decisions. It is useful for casual users who employ scheduling constraints (for example, inter-Pod affinity ) and experts who extend the scheduler with custom plugins. The scheduler often appears as a black box, composed of many plugins that each contribute to the scheduling decision-making process from their unique perspectives. Understanding its behavior can be challenging due to the multitude of factors it considers. Even if a Pod appears to be scheduled correctly in a simple test cluster, it might have been scheduled based on different calculations than expected. This discrepancy could lead to unexpected scheduling outcomes when deployed in a large production environment. Also, testing a scheduler is a complex challenge. There are countless patterns of operations executed within a real cluster, making it unfeasible to anticipate every scenario with a finite number of tests. More often than not, bugs are discovered only when the scheduler is deployed in an actual cluster.</description></item><item><title>Sharks of DigitalOcean: Makeissah Robinson, Senior Director, Customer Support</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-04-03-sharks-of-digitalocean-makeissah-robinson-senior-director-customer-support/</link><pubDate>Thu, 03 Apr 2025 04:15:54 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-04-03-sharks-of-digitalocean-makeissah-robinson-senior-director-customer-support/</guid><description>Sharks of DigitalOcean: Makeissah Robinson, Senior Director, Customer Support How does your team contribute to DigitalOceanâs mission?

However, connecting different cloud environments securely and efficiently is a major headache. Many businesses struggle with unpredictable latency and complex VPN setups to keep their distributed workloads running smoothly. Without a seamless solution, managing cloud connectivity becomes a costly and time-consuming burden. At DigitalOcean, weâre committed to helping to eliminate these challenges by making cloud networking simpler, more scalable, and more accessible. Today, weâre excited to introduce the general availability of DigitalOcean Partner Network Connect, a cross-cloud connectivity solution that enables more secure, high-performance networking between DigitalOcean and other cloud providers or on-premise data centers. With Partner Network Connect, growing businesses can establish direct, private connections between DigitalOcean and other cloud providers or on-premise data centers or co-location facilitiesâbypassing the public internet to help improve security, minimize latency, and increase network performance. By integrating with Megaport, a leading Network-as-a-Service (NaaS) provider, weâre helping our customers connect their distributed workloads across multiple clouds easily, reliably, and affordably.

DigitalOcean Partner Network Connect helps eliminate these challenges for cloud-to-cloud and on-premise connectivity. Key benefits include: Improved latency: Low latency, high-bandwidth private connectivity (1 Gbps to 10 Gbps) for faster, more reliable performance across cloud and on-premise environments.</description></item><item><title>Tomcat in the Crosshairs: New Research Reveals Ongoing Attacks</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-04-02-tomcat-in-the-crosshairs-new-research-reveals-ongoing-attacks/</link><pubDate>Wed, 02 Apr 2025 12:00:49 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-04-02-tomcat-in-the-crosshairs-new-research-reveals-ongoing-attacks/</guid><description>Tomcat in the Crosshairs: New Research Reveals Ongoing Attacks Tomcat Campaign 25′: Attack Flow Detecting This Malware and Protecting your Environments Mitigation of Tomcat environments Indications of Compromise (IOCs) News headlines reported that it took just 30 hours for attackers to exploit a newly discovered vulnerability in Apache Tomcat servers. But what does this mean for workloads relying on Tomcat? Aqua Nautilus researchers discovered a new attack campaign targeting Apache Tomcat. In this blog, we shed light on newly discovered malware that targets Tomcat servers to hijack resources. After gaining initial access, the attackers uploads encrypted and encoded payloads that establish backdoors and persistence mechanisms. They then deploy two binaries disguised as kernel processes to exploit the server. The attack infrastructure appears to be relatively new, and code snippets suggest possible links to a Chinese-speaking threat actor. In this blog, we break down how the attack works—and how to stop it. The campaign targets Apache Tomcat servers and deploys encrypted payloads designed to run on both Windows and Linux systems. Once executed, the attack disguises itself, steals SSH credentials to spread laterally, and ultimately hijacks resources for cryptocurrency mining. It all starts with a brute-force attempt from a remote server using a Python script, which tests commonly used usernames and weak passwords on the Tomcat management console (e. g. , username “Tomcat” and password “123456”).</description></item><item><title>Introducing AMD Instinct MI300X GPUs to the DigitalOcean Bare Metal fleet</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-04-01-introducing-amd-instinct-mi300x-gpus-to-the-digitalocean-bare-metal-fleet/</link><pubDate>Tue, 01 Apr 2025 21:42:26 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-04-01-introducing-amd-instinct-mi300x-gpus-to-the-digitalocean-bare-metal-fleet/</guid><description>Introducing AMD Instinct MI300X GPUs to the DigitalOcean Bare Metal fleet What are AMD Instinct MI300X GPUs?

However, as applications grow, so do their infrastructure and scaling requirements. Managing multiple clusters to handle large-scale workloads introduces operational complexity, increased network management, and challenges for the DevOps teams. These challenges can include greater resource fragmentation, increased latency due to inter-cluster communication, and the manual burden of maintaining security and compliance across multiple clusters. These challenges are particularly pronounced for data-intensive workloads like video streaming, large-scale data analytics, and security operations. Thatâs why weâre excited to announce a major evolution of DigitalOcean Kubernetes Service (DOKS), which consists of four features: Increased cluster capacity to 1,000 worker nodes per cluster Increased cluster capacity to 1,000 worker nodes per cluster Optimized networking with VPC-native Kubernetes Optimized networking with VPC-native Kubernetes Improved performance with eBPF-powered networking Improved performance with eBPF-powered networking Managed Cilium for high-performance networking Managed Cilium for high-performance networking These updates help to empower businesses to run larger workloads within a single DOKS cluster, reducing the need for complex multi-cluster management and unlocking new levels of performance, reliability, and simplicity.

Security incidents rarely happen because of a single weak point. Instead, they stem from toxic combinations. A misconfigured workload might seem harmless on its own, but add exposed credentials and an unpatched vulnerability, and attackers have a direct path to exploitation. Traditional vulnerability scanners surface thousands of issues, yet many tools treat vulnerabilities, misconfigurations, malware, and exposed credentials as isolated problems rather than recognizing how they can combine to create real attack scenarios Without understanding the full attack surface and how risks interact, security teams end up chasing alerts instead of preventing breaches. Instead of drowning in alerts, you need context, a way to connect security findings across the entire cloud native application lifecycle. Aqua provides that visibility, correlating risks from the first line of code to runtime so security teams can focus on what is actually exploitable, not just what is flagged. But risk prioritization is not just about what exists, it is about what an attacker can actually access and exploit. A vulnerability might seem critical, but is it isolated in a test environment, restricted within an internal network, or exposed in a production system accessible from the internet? For example, a banking application with an unpatched critical vulnerability might seem like an urgent issue, but if it is running in a segmented test environment, the risk is far lower than if the same vulnerability exists in a publicly accessible production system. Aqua assesses network exposure, identifying whether a CVE is just a theoretical risk or if it is publicly accessible and exploitable. By linking misconfigurations, exposed credentials, and network exposure with known vulnerabilities, Aqua surfaces toxic combinations that create real world attack paths. Aqua also connects these risks across hybrid and multi-cloud environments, ensuring teams have a comprehensive view of their attack surface, no matter where workloads are running.</description></item><item><title>Kubernetes v1.33 sneak peek</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-03-26-kubernetes-v1-33-sneak-peek/</link><pubDate>Wed, 26 Mar 2025 10:30:00 -0800</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-03-26-kubernetes-v1-33-sneak-peek/</guid><description>Kubernetes v1.33 sneak peek The Kubernetes API removal and deprecation process Deprecations and removals for Kubernetes v1.33 Deprecation of the stable Endpoints API Removal of kube-proxy version information in node status Removal of host network support for Windows pods Featured improvement of Kubernetes v1.33 Support for user namespaces within Linux Pods Selected other Kubernetes v1.33 improvements In-place resource resize for vertical scaling of Pods DRA’s ResourceClaim Device Status graduates to beta Ordered namespace deletion Enhancements for indexed job management Want to know more? Get involved As the release of Kubernetes v1.33 approaches, the Kubernetes project continues to evolve. Features may be deprecated, removed, or replaced to improve the overall health of the project. This blog post outlines some planned changes for the v1.33 release, which the release team believes you should be aware of to ensure the continued smooth operation of your Kubernetes environment and to keep you up-to-date with the latest developments. The information below is based on the current status of the v1.33 release and is subject to change before the final release date. The Kubernetes project has a well-documented deprecation policy for features. This policy states that stable APIs may only be deprecated when a newer, stable version of that same API is available and that APIs have a minimum lifetime for each stability level. A deprecated API has been marked for removal in a future Kubernetes release. It will continue to function until removal (at least one year from the deprecation), but usage will result in a warning being displayed. Removed APIs are no longer available in the current version, at which point you must migrate to using the replacement. Generally available (GA) or stable API versions may be marked as deprecated but must not be removed within a major version of Kubernetes. Beta or pre-release API versions must be supported for 3 releases after the deprecation. Alpha or experimental API versions may be removed in any release without prior deprecation notice; this process can become a withdrawal in cases where a different implementation for the same feature is already in place.</description></item><item><title>IngressNightmare Vulnerabilities: All You Need to Know</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-03-26-ingressnightmare-vulnerabilities-all-you-need-to-know/</link><pubDate>Wed, 26 Mar 2025 13:15:57 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-03-26-ingressnightmare-vulnerabilities-all-you-need-to-know/</guid><description>IngressNightmare Vulnerabilities: All You Need to Know What is the Ingress Controller Understanding the IngressNightmare vulnerabilities Vulnerabilities Details and Impact Are you Affected?

How do I get involved? Swap is a fundamental and an invaluable Linux feature. It offers numerous benefits, such as effectively increasing a node’s memory by swapping out unused data, shielding nodes from system-level memory spikes, preventing Pods from crashing when they hit their memory limits, and much more. As a result, the node special interest group within the Kubernetes project has invested significant effort into supporting swap on Linux nodes. The 1.22 release introduced Alpha support for configuring swap memory usage for Kubernetes workloads running on Linux on a per-node basis. Later, in release 1.28, support for swap on Linux nodes has graduated to Beta, along with many new improvements. In the following Kubernetes releases more improvements were made, paving the way to GA in the near future. Prior to version 1.22, Kubernetes did not provide support for swap memory on Linux systems. This was due to the inherent difficulty in guaranteeing and accounting for pod memory utilization when swap memory was involved. As a result, swap support was deemed out of scope in the initial design of Kubernetes, and the default behavior of a kubelet was to fail to start if swap memory was detected on a node. In version 1.22, the swap feature for Linux was initially introduced in its Alpha stage. This provided Linux users the opportunity to experiment with the swap feature for the first time. However, as an Alpha version, it was not fully developed and only partially worked on limited environments.</description></item><item><title>Ingress-nginx CVE-2025-1974: What You Need to Know</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-03-24-ingress-nginx-cve-2025-1974-what-you-need-to-know/</link><pubDate>Mon, 24 Mar 2025 12:00:00 -0800</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-03-24-ingress-nginx-cve-2025-1974-what-you-need-to-know/</guid><description>Ingress-nginx CVE-2025-1974: What You Need to Know Background Vulnerabilities Patched Today Your next steps Conclusion, thanks, and further reading Today, the ingress-nginx maintainers have released patches for a batch of critical vulnerabilities that could make it easy for attackers to take over your Kubernetes cluster: ingress-nginx v1.12.1 and ingress-nginx v1.11.5. If you are among the over 40% of Kubernetes administrators using ingress-nginx , you should take action immediately to protect your users and data. Ingress is the traditional Kubernetes feature for exposing your workload Pods to the world so that they can be useful. In an implementation-agnostic way, Kubernetes users can define how their applications should be made available on the network. Then, an ingress controller uses that definition to set up local or cloud resources as required for the user’s particular situation and needs. Many different ingress controllers are available, to suit users of different cloud providers or brands of load balancers. Ingress-nginx is a software-only ingress controller provided by the Kubernetes project. Because of its versatility and ease of use, ingress-nginx is quite popular: it is deployed in over 40% of Kubernetes clusters! Ingress-nginx translates the requirements from Ingress objects into configuration for nginx, a powerful open source webserver daemon. Then, nginx uses that configuration to accept and route requests to the various applications running within a Kubernetes cluster. Proper handling of these nginx configuration parameters is crucial, because ingress-nginx needs to allow users significant flexibility while preventing them from accidentally or intentionally tricking nginx into doing things it shouldn’t. Four of today’s ingress-nginx vulnerabilities are improvements to how ingress-nginx handles particular bits of nginx config. Without these fixes, a specially-crafted Ingress object can cause nginx to misbehave in various ways, including revealing the values of Secrets that are accessible to ingress-nginx.</description></item><item><title>How the Google-Wiz acquisition redefines cloud security</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-03-24-how-the-google-wiz-acquisition-redefines-cloud-security/</link><pubDate>Mon, 24 Mar 2025 16:36:45 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-03-24-how-the-google-wiz-acquisition-redefines-cloud-security/</guid><description>How the Google-Wiz acquisition redefines cloud security CNAPP is Dead! Long Live CNAPP! What does the future hold for our customers? Google’s acquisition of Wiz, announced last week, is a pivotal moment as it marks a strategic shift in how cyber security will evolve over the next few years. It instantly turns Google into a major player in security, adding Wiz to other building blocks Google has racked up in the past couple of years, most notably Mandiant and Google Chronicle. Google will be a new gorilla in the security market, just as Microsoft created a thriving, multi-billion dollar business out of the Defender product line. But while Microsoft has a long history of “owning” operating systems, servers, and Office applications, and is leveraging that to expand its footprint, Google is new to the enterprise security business. In the first phase of public cloud adoption, the “lift and shift” phase, CSPM (cloud security posture management) emerged to ensure proper configuration of cloud services, and CWPP (cloud workload protection platforms) to monitor and protect workloads running in the cloud. The second phase of cloud adoption, the cloud native phase, driven by technologies such as containers, serverless functions, CI/CD, and orchestration (Kubernetes), imparted an even more dramatic change in security – the integration of multiple silos of application related security information. It introduced integrated shift left capabilities , providing a broader risk-based approach to vulnerability management, hardening, and incident management. Thus CNAPP (cloud native application protection platforms) was born. In the early days of cloud services, the cloud providers adopted the shared responsibility model in which some responsibilities were borne by them (such as infrastructure and physical security), others were clearly on the shoulders of customers (configuring of services, their data, their users, their applications), and there’s been a non-negligible area of “shared responsibility” where the answer is often “it depends”. I believe that with this move, Google is shifting the borders within this model and will be offering more of the posture management and visibility to customers as part of its infrastructure. After all this is what Wiz has become famous for – agentless scanning of the cloud estate, providing broad visibility and risk assessment. And this is something a cloud provider can easily integrate into cloud operations.</description></item><item><title>Introducing JobSet</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-03-23-introducing-jobset/</link><pubDate>Sun, 23 Mar 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-03-23-introducing-jobset/</guid><description>Introducing JobSet Why JobSet? How JobSet Works Example use case Distributed ML training on multiple TPU slices with Jax Future work and getting involved Authors : Daniel Vega-Myhre (Google), Abdullah Gharaibeh (Google), Kevin Hannon (Red Hat) In this article, we introduce JobSet , an open source API for representing distributed jobs. The goal of JobSet is to provide a unified API for distributed ML training and HPC workloads on Kubernetes. The Kubernetes community’s recent enhancements to the batch ecosystem on Kubernetes has attracted ML engineers who have found it to be a natural fit for the requirements of running distributed training workloads. Large ML models (particularly LLMs) which cannot fit into the memory of the GPU or TPU chips on a single host are often distributed across tens of thousands of accelerator chips, which in turn may span thousands of hosts. As such, the model training code is often containerized and executed simultaneously on all these hosts, performing distributed computations which often shard both the model parameters and/or the training dataset across the target accelerator chips, using communication collective primitives like all-gather and all-reduce to perform distributed computations and synchronize gradients between hosts. These workload characteristics make Kubernetes a great fit for this type of workload, as efficiently scheduling and managing the lifecycle of containerized applications across a cluster of compute resources is an area where it shines. It is also very extensible, allowing developers to define their own Kubernetes APIs, objects, and controllers which manage the behavior and life cycle of these objects, allowing engineers to develop custom distributed training orchestration solutions to fit their needs. However, as distributed ML training techniques continue to evolve, existing Kubernetes primitives do not adequately model them alone anymore. Furthermore, the landscape of Kubernetes distributed training orchestration APIs has become fragmented, and each of the existing solutions in this fragmented landscape has certain limitations that make it non-optimal for distributed ML training. For example, the KubeFlow training operator defines custom APIs for different frameworks (e. g. PyTorchJob, TFJob, MPIJob, etc.</description></item><item><title>Powering AI Innovation: DigitalOcean Bare Metal GPUs in EU Data Center</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-03-20-powering-ai-innovation-digitalocean-bare-metal-gpus-in-eu-data-center/</link><pubDate>Thu, 20 Mar 2025 14:59:45 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-03-20-powering-ai-innovation-digitalocean-bare-metal-gpus-in-eu-data-center/</guid><description>Powering AI Innovation: DigitalOcean Bare Metal GPUs in EU Data Center Lower latency for inferencing in the EU Privacy at the core The benefits of bare metal for AI/ML workloads Powering European AI: DigitalOcean Bare Metal GPUs in EU data center About the author Try DigitalOcean for free Related Articles Announcing OpenAI gpt-oss Models on the DigitalOcean Gradientâ¢ AI Platform Build smarter AI agents: new tools now available for the DigitalOcean Gradientâ¢ AI Platform Introducing GPU Droplets accelerated by NVIDIA HGX H200 By DigitalOcean Published: March 20, 2025 5 min read Bare Metal GPUs are now DigitalOcean GradientAI Bare Metal GPUs.

But as workloads scale, how do you ensure your Spark jobs run efficiently without hitting bottlenecks? Managing thousands of concurrent Spark jobs can introduce severe performance challenges —from CPU saturation in the Spark Operator to Kubernetes API slowdowns and job scheduling inefficiencies. To address these challenges, we are excited to introduce the Kubeflow Spark Operator Benchmarking Results and Toolkit —a comprehensive framework to analyze performance, pinpoint bottlenecks, and optimize your Spark on Kubernetes deployments. This benchmarking effort provides three key outcomes to help you take full control of your Spark on Kubernetes deployment: ✅ Benchmarking Results – A detailed evaluation of performance insights and tuning recommendations for large-scale Spark workloads. 🛠 Benchmarking Test Toolkit – A fully reproducible test suite to help users evaluate their own Spark Operator performance and validate improvements. 📊 Open-Sourced Grafana Dashboard – A battle-tested visualization tool designed specifically to track large-scale Spark Operator deployments, providing real-time monitoring of job processing efficiency, API latencies, and system health. Running thousands of Spark jobs on Kubernetes at scale uncovers several performance roadblocks that can cripple efficiency if left unresolved: 🚦 Spark Operator Becomes CPU-Bound : When handling thousands of Spark jobs, the controller pod maxes out CPU resources, limiting job submission rates. 🐢 High API Server Latency : As workloads scale, Kubernetes API responsiveness degrades—job status updates slow down, affecting observability and scheduling efficiency. 🕒 Webhook Overhead Slows Job Starts : Using webhooks adds ~60 seconds of extra latency per job, reducing throughput in high-concurrency environments. 💥 Namespace Overload Causes Failures : Running 6,000+ SparkApplications in a single namespace resulted in pod failures due to excessive environment variables and service object overload. 💡 So, how do you fix these issues and optimize your Spark Operator deployment? That’s where our benchmarking results and toolkit come in. Based on our benchmarking findings, we provide clear, actionable recommendations for improving Spark Operator performance at scale.</description></item><item><title>DigitalOcean Managed MongoDB now supports MongoDB 8.0</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-03-13-digitalocean-managed-mongodb-now-supports-mongodb-8-0/</link><pubDate>Thu, 13 Mar 2025 17:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-03-13-digitalocean-managed-mongodb-now-supports-mongodb-8-0/</guid><description>DigitalOcean Managed MongoDB now supports MongoDB 8.0 Whatâs new in MongoDB 8.0?

Sandipan Panda ( DevZero ) had the opportunity to interview Maciej Szulik ( Defense Unicorns ) and Janet Kuo ( Google ), the chairs and tech leads of SIG Apps. They shared their experiences, challenges, and visions for the future of application management within the Kubernetes ecosystem. Sandipan: Hello, could you start by telling us a bit about yourself, your role, and your journey within the Kubernetes community that led to your current roles in SIG Apps? Maciej : Hey, my name is Maciej, and I’m one of the leads for SIG Apps. Aside from this role, you can also find me helping SIG CLI and also being one of the Steering Committee members. I’ve been contributing to Kubernetes since late 2014 in various areas, including controllers, apiserver, and kubectl. Janet : Certainly! I&amp;rsquo;m Janet, a Staff Software Engineer at Google, and I&amp;rsquo;ve been deeply involved with the Kubernetes project since its early days, even before the 1.0 launch in 2015. It&amp;rsquo;s been an amazing journey! My current role within the Kubernetes community is one of the chairs and tech leads of SIG Apps. My journey with SIG Apps started organically. I started with building the Deployment API and adding rolling update functionalities.

The attack consists of multiple stages, beginning with the download of a compressed file from a remote server. Once executed, the attacker deploys several malicious tools to exploit the server and establish persistence. This campaign poses a significant risk to cloud-native environments, as it enables unauthorized access and long-term control over compromised systems. Jupyter Notebooks In this blog, we will outline the attack stages, discuss the potential risks, and provide recommendations to strengthen security and prevent exploitation. Interactive Computing Environments or Notebook Interfaces are platforms designed for data scientists and programmers to write, execute, and analyze code interactively. There are many products available, including Jupyter Notebook , JupyterLab , Apache Zeppelin , Google Colab , Databricks Notebooks , and others. These environments are often connected to the internet and require authentication to access data or execute code. However, a simple misconfiguration can sometimes expose the server to malicious activity by hackers. Jupyter Notebook JupyterLab Apache Zeppelin Google Colab Databricks Notebooks Figure 1: Sobolan campaign attack flow The attackers gained initial access through an unauthenticated JupyterLab instance, allowing them to deploy malware and cryptominers. They first downloaded and extracted a compressed archive containing 13 malicious files, consisting of both binaries and shell scripts. Once executed, these scripts initiated multiple processes to establish persistence, hijack system resources for cryptomining, and evade detection (as shown in Figure 1).</description></item><item><title>Introducing a Managed Component for Maintaining Host Routes in Kubernetes</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-03-10-introducing-a-managed-component-for-maintaining-host-routes-in-kubernetes/</link><pubDate>Mon, 10 Mar 2025 19:39:28 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-03-10-introducing-a-managed-component-for-maintaining-host-routes-in-kubernetes/</guid><description>Introducing a Managed Component for Maintaining Host Routes in Kubernetes Key Features of the DOKS Routing Agent 1.

Part 1: data plane latency Why nftables? Part 2: control plane latency Why not nftables? Trying out nftables mode Future plans Learn more A new nftables mode for kube-proxy was introduced as an alpha feature in Kubernetes 1.29. Currently in beta, it is expected to be GA as of 1.33. The new mode fixes long-standing performance problems with the iptables mode and all users running on systems with reasonably-recent kernels are encouraged to try it out. (For compatibility reasons, even once nftables becomes GA, iptables will still be the default. ) The iptables API was designed for implementing simple firewalls, and has problems scaling up to support Service proxying in a large Kubernetes cluster with tens of thousands of Services. In general, the ruleset generated by kube-proxy in iptables mode has a number of iptables rules proportional to the sum of the number of Services and the total number of endpoints. In particular, at the top level of the ruleset, there is one rule to test each possible Service IP (and port) that a packet might be addressed to: # If the packet is addressed to 172.30.0.41:80, then jump to the chain # KUBE-SVC-XPGD46QRK7WJZT7O for further processing -A KUBE-SERVICES -m comment &amp;ndash;comment &amp;ldquo;namespace1/service1:p80 cluster IP&amp;rdquo; -m tcp -p tcp -d 172.30.0.41 &amp;ndash;dport 80 -j KUBE-SVC-XPGD46QRK7WJZT7O # If the packet is addressed to 172.30.0.42:443, then. -A KUBE-SERVICES -m comment &amp;ndash;comment &amp;ldquo;namespace2/service2:p443 cluster IP&amp;rdquo; -m tcp -p tcp -d 172.30.0.42 &amp;ndash;dport 443 -j KUBE-SVC-GNZBNJ2PO5MGZ6GT # etc. -A KUBE-SERVICES -m comment &amp;ndash;comment &amp;ldquo;namespace3/service3:p80 cluster IP&amp;rdquo; -m tcp -p tcp -d 172.30.0.43 &amp;ndash;dport 80 -j KUBE-SVC-X27LE4BHSL4DOUIK # If the packet is addressed to 172.30.0.41:80, then jump to the chain # KUBE-SVC-XPGD46QRK7WJZT7O for further processing -A KUBE-SERVICES -m comment &amp;ndash;comment &amp;ldquo;namespace1/service1:p80 cluster IP&amp;rdquo; -m tcp -p tcp -d 172.30.0.41 &amp;ndash;dport 80 -j KUBE-SVC-XPGD46QRK7WJZT7O # If the packet is addressed to 172.30.0.42:443, then. -A KUBE-SERVICES -m comment &amp;ndash;comment &amp;ldquo;namespace2/service2:p443 cluster IP&amp;rdquo; -m tcp -p tcp -d 172.30.0.42 &amp;ndash;dport 443 -j KUBE-SVC-GNZBNJ2PO5MGZ6GT # etc. -A KUBE-SERVICES -m comment &amp;ndash;comment &amp;ldquo;namespace3/service3:p80 cluster IP&amp;rdquo; -m tcp -p tcp -d 172.30.0.43 &amp;ndash;dport 80 -j KUBE-SVC-X27LE4BHSL4DOUIK This means that when a packet comes in, the time it takes the kernel to check it against all of the Service rules is O(n) in the number of Services. As the number of Services increases, both the average and the worst-case latency for the first packet of a new connection increases (with the difference between best-case, average, and worst-case being mostly determined by whether a given Service IP address appears earlier or later in the KUBE-SERVICES chain).</description></item><item><title>Optimizing RAG Pipelines with Katib: Hyperparameter Tuning for Better Retrieval &amp;amp; Generation</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-02-21-optimizing-rag-pipelines-with-katib-hyperparameter-tuning-for-better-retrieval-a/</link><pubDate>Fri, 21 Feb 2025 00:00:00 -0600</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-02-21-optimizing-rag-pipelines-with-katib-hyperparameter-tuning-for-better-retrieval-a/</guid><description>Introduction Let’s Get Started! STEP 1: Setup STEP 2: Implementing RAG pipeline Implementation Details: STEP 3: Run a Katib Experiment Define hyperparameter search space Conclusion Introduction Let’s Get Started! STEP 1: Setup STEP 2: Implementing RAG pipeline Implementation Details: STEP 3: Run a Katib Experiment STEP 1: Setup STEP 2: Implementing RAG pipeline Implementation Details: Implementation Details: STEP 3: Run a Katib Experiment Define hyperparameter search space Conclusion As artificial intelligence and machine learning models become more sophisticated, optimising their performance remains a critical challenge. Kubeflow provides a robust component, Katib , designed for hyperparameter optimization and neural architecture search. As a part of the Kubeflow ecosystem, Katib enables scalable, automated tuning of underlying machine learning models, reducing the manual effort required for parameter selection while improving model performance across diverse ML workflows. With Retrieval-Augmented Generation ( RAG ) becoming an increasingly popular approach for improving search and retrieval quality, optimizing its parameters is essential to achieving high-quality results. RAG pipelines involve multiple hyperparameters that influence retrieval accuracy, hallucination reduction, and language generation quality. In this blog, we will explore how Katib can be leveraged to fine-tune a RAG pipeline, ensuring optimal performance by systematically adjusting key hyperparameters. Since compute resources are scarcer than a perfectly labeled dataset :), we’ll use a lightweight Kind cluster (Kubernetes in Docker) cluster to run this example locally. Rest assured, this setup can seamlessly scale to larger clusters by increasing the dataset size and the number of hyperparameters to tune. To get started, we’ll first install the Katib control plane in our cluster by following the steps outlined in the documentation. In this implementation, we use a retriever model , which encodes queries and documents into vector representations to find the most relevant matches, to fetch relevant documents based on a query and a generator model to produce coherent text responses. Retriever: Sentence Transformer &amp;amp; FAISS (Facebook AI Similarity Search) Index A SentenceTransformer model (paraphrase-MiniLM-L6-v2) encodes predefined documents into vector representations. FAISS is used to index these document embeddings and perform efficient similarity searches to retrieve the most relevant documents.</description></item><item><title>Synthetic Data Generation with Kubeflow Pipelines</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-02-16-synthetic-data-generation-with-kubeflow-pipelines/</link><pubDate>Sun, 16 Feb 2025 00:00:00 -0600</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-02-16-synthetic-data-generation-with-kubeflow-pipelines/</guid><description>Synthetic Data Generation - Why and How?

But accessing real data often requires lengthy security and legal processes. The data may also be incomplete, biased, or too small, and during early exploration, we may not even know if it’s worth pursuing. While real data is essential for proper evaluation, gaps or limited access frequently hinder progress until the formal process is complete. To address these challenges, synthetic data provides an alternative. It mimics real data’s statistical properties while preserving privacy and accessibility. Synthetic data generators (synthesizers) are models trained on real data to generate new datasets that follow the same statistical distributions and relationships but do not contain real records. This allows for accelerated development, improved data availability, and enhanced privacy. Depending on the technique used, synthetic data not only mirrors statistical base properties of real data but also preserves correlations between features. These synthesizers — such as those based on Gaussian Copulas, Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), and Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) — enable the creation of high-fidelity synthetic datasets. See more description of these techniques below. While the above focuses on speed of development in general, and augmentation of data to improve performance of analytical modes, there are more motivations for creating (synthetic) data: Enhanced Privacy and Security Mimics real datasets without containing sensitive or personally identifiable information, mitigating privacy risks and ensuring compliance with regulations like GDPR.</description></item><item><title>The Cloud Controller Manager Chicken and Egg Problem</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-02-14-the-cloud-controller-manager-chicken-and-egg-problem/</link><pubDate>Fri, 14 Feb 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-02-14-the-cloud-controller-manager-chicken-and-egg-problem/</guid><description>The Cloud Controller Manager Chicken and Egg Problem Examples of the dependency problem Example: Cloud controller manager not scheduling due to uninitialized taint Example: Cloud controller manager not scheduling due to not-ready taint Our Recommendations Example Kubernetes 1.31 completed the largest migration in Kubernetes history , removing the in-tree cloud provider. While the component migration is now done, this leaves some additional complexity for users and installer projects (for example, kOps or Cluster API). We will go over those additional steps and failure points and make recommendations for cluster owners. This migration was complex and some logic had to be extracted from the core components, building four new subsystems. Cloud controller manager ( KEP-2392 ) API server network proxy ( KEP-1281 ) kubelet credential provider plugins ( KEP-2133 ) Storage migration to use CSI ( KEP-625 ) The cloud controller manager is part of the control plane. It is a critical component that replaces some functionality that existed previously in the kube-controller-manager and the kubelet. Components of Kubernetes One of the most critical functionalities of the cloud controller manager is the node controller, which is responsible for the initialization of the nodes. As you can see in the following diagram, when the kubelet starts, it registers the Node object with the apiserver, Tainting the node so it can be processed first by the cloud-controller-manager. The initial Node is missing the cloud-provider specific information, like the Node Addresses and the Labels with the cloud provider specific information like the Node, Region and Instance type information. Chicken and egg problem sequence diagram This new initialization process adds some latency to the node readiness. Previously, the kubelet was able to initialize the node at the same time it created the node. Since the logic has moved to the cloud-controller-manager, this can cause a chicken and egg problem during the cluster bootstrapping for those Kubernetes architectures that do not deploy the controller manager as the other components of the control plane, commonly as static pods, standalone binaries or daemonsets/deployments with tolerations to the taints and using hostNetwork (more on this below) hostNetwork As noted above, it is possible during bootstrapping for the cloud-controller-manager to be unschedulable and as such the cluster will not initialize properly.</description></item><item><title>Blog: Spotlight on SIG Architecture: Enhancements</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-01-21-blog-spotlight-on-sig-architecture-enhancements/</link><pubDate>Tue, 21 Jan 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-01-21-blog-spotlight-on-sig-architecture-enhancements/</guid><description>Spotlight on SIG Architecture: Enhancements The Enhancements subproject The KEP and its impact Current areas of focus Getting involved This is the fourth interview of a SIG Architecture Spotlight series that will cover the different subprojects, and we will be covering SIG Architecture: Enhancements.

Kubernetes APIs for volume group snapshots What components are needed to support volume group snapshots What&amp;rsquo;s new in Beta? How do I use Kubernetes volume group snapshots Creating a new group snapshot with Kubernetes How to use group snapshot for restore in Kubernetes As a storage vendor, how do I add support for group snapshots to my CSI driver? What are the limitations? What’s next? How do I get involved? Volume group snapshots were introduced as an Alpha feature with the Kubernetes 1.27 release. The recent release of Kubernetes v1.32 moved that support to beta. The support for volume group snapshots relies on a set of extension APIs for group snapshots. These APIs allow users to take crash consistent snapshots for a set of volumes. Behind the scenes, Kubernetes uses a label selector to group multiple PersistentVolumeClaims for snapshotting. A key aim is to allow you restore that set of snapshots to new volumes and recover your workload based on a crash consistent recovery point. This new feature is only supported for CSI volume drivers. Some storage systems provide the ability to create a crash consistent snapshot of multiple volumes. A group snapshot represents copies made from multiple volumes, that are taken at the same point-in-time. A group snapshot can be used either to rehydrate new volumes (pre-populated with the snapshot data) or to restore existing volumes to a previous state (represented by the snapshots). The Kubernetes volume plugin system already provides a powerful abstraction that automates the provisioning, attaching, mounting, resizing, and snapshotting of block and file storage. Underpinning all these features is the Kubernetes goal of workload portability: Kubernetes aims to create an abstraction layer between distributed applications and underlying clusters so that applications can be agnostic to the specifics of the cluster they run on and application deployment requires no cluster specific knowledge.</description></item><item><title>Enhancing Kubernetes API Server Efficiency with API Streaming</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2024-12-17-enhancing-kubernetes-api-server-efficiency-with-api-streaming/</link><pubDate>Tue, 17 Dec 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2024-12-17-enhancing-kubernetes-api-server-efficiency-with-api-streaming/</guid><description>Enhancing Kubernetes API Server Efficiency with API Streaming Why does kube-apiserver allocate so much memory for list requests? Streaming list requests Enabling API Streaming for your component What&amp;rsquo;s next? The synthetic test Kubernetes 1.33 update Managing Kubernetes clusters efficiently is critical, especially as their size is growing. A significant challenge with large clusters is the memory overhead caused by list requests. In the existing implementation, the kube-apiserver processes list requests by assembling the entire response in-memory before transmitting any data to the client. But what if the response body is substantial, say hundreds of megabytes? Additionally, imagine a scenario where multiple list requests flood in simultaneously, perhaps after a brief network outage. While API Priority and Fairness has proven to reasonably protect kube-apiserver from CPU overload, its impact is visibly smaller for memory protection. This can be explained by the differing nature of resource consumption by a single API request - the CPU usage at any given time is capped by a constant, whereas memory, being uncompressible, can grow proportionally with the number of processed objects and is unbounded. This situation poses a genuine risk, potentially overwhelming and crashing any kube-apiserver within seconds due to out-of-memory (OOM) conditions. To better visualize the issue, let&amp;rsquo;s consider the below graph. The graph shows the memory usage of a kube-apiserver during a synthetic test. (see the synthetic test section for more details). The results clearly show that increasing the number of informers significantly boosts the server&amp;rsquo;s memory consumption. Notably, at approximately 16:40, the server crashed when serving only 16 informers.</description></item><item><title>Kubernetes v1.32 Adds A New CPU Manager Static Policy Option For Strict CPU Reservation</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2024-12-16-kubernetes-v1-32-adds-a-new-cpu-manager-static-policy-option-for-strict-cpu-rese/</link><pubDate>Mon, 16 Dec 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2024-12-16-kubernetes-v1-32-adds-a-new-cpu-manager-static-policy-option-for-strict-cpu-rese/</guid><description>Kubernetes v1.32 Adds A New CPU Manager Static Policy Option For Strict CPU Reservation Understanding the feature Enabling the feature Monitoring the feature Conclusion Further reading Getting involved In Kubernetes v1.32, after years of community discussion, we are excited to introduce a strict-cpu-reservation option for the CPU Manager static policy. This feature is currently in alpha, with the associated policy hidden by default. You can only use the policy if you explicitly enable the alpha behavior in your cluster. strict-cpu-reservation The CPU Manager static policy is used to reduce latency or improve performance. The reservedSystemCPUs defines an explicit CPU set for OS system daemons and kubernetes system daemons. This option is designed for Telco/NFV type use cases where uncontrolled interrupts/timers may impact the workload performance. you can use this option to define the explicit cpuset for the system/kubernetes daemons as well as the interrupts/timers, so the rest CPUs on the system can be used exclusively for workloads, with less impact from uncontrolled interrupts/timers. More details of this parameter can be found on the Explicitly Reserved CPU List page. reservedSystemCPUs If you want to protect your system daemons and interrupt processing, the obvious way is to use the reservedSystemCPUs option. reservedSystemCPUs However, until the Kubernetes v1.32 release, this isolation was only implemented for guaranteed pods that made requests for a whole number of CPUs. At pod admission time, the kubelet only compares the CPU requests against the allocatable CPUs. In Kubernetes, limits can be higher than the requests; the previous implementation allowed burstable and best-effort pods to use up the capacity of reservedSystemCPUs , which could then starve host OS services of CPU - and we know that people saw this in real life deployments.</description></item><item><title>Kubernetes v1.32: Memory Manager Goes GA</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2024-12-13-kubernetes-v1-32-memory-manager-goes-ga/</link><pubDate>Fri, 13 Dec 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2024-12-13-kubernetes-v1-32-memory-manager-goes-ga/</guid><description>Kubernetes v1.32: Memory Manager Goes GA Observability improvements Improving memory manager reliability and consistency Future development Getting involved With Kubernetes 1.32, the memory manager has officially graduated to General Availability (GA), marking a significant milestone in the journey toward efficient and predictable memory allocation for containerized applications. Since Kubernetes v1.22, where it graduated to beta, the memory manager has proved itself reliable, stable and a good complementary feature for the CPU Manager. As part of kubelet&amp;rsquo;s workload admission process, the memory manager provides topology hints to optimize memory allocation and alignment. This enables users to allocate exclusive memory for Pods in the Guaranteed QoS class. More details about the process can be found in the memory manager goes to beta blog. Most of the changes introduced since the Beta are bug fixes, internal refactoring and observability improvements, such as metrics and better logging. As part of the effort to increase the observability of memory manager, new metrics have been added to provide some statistics on memory allocation patterns. memory_manager_pinning_requests_total - tracks the number of times the pod spec required the memory manager to pin memory pages. memory_manager_pinning_errors_total - tracks the number of times the pod spec required the memory manager to pin memory pages, but the allocation failed. The kubelet does not guarantee pod ordering when admitting pods after a restart or reboot. In certain edge cases, this behavior could cause the memory manager to reject some pods, and in more extreme cases, it may cause kubelet to fail upon restart. Previously, the beta implementation lacked certain checks and logic to prevent these issues.</description></item><item><title>Kubernetes v1.32: QueueingHint Brings a New Possibility to Optimize Pod Scheduling</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2024-12-12-kubernetes-v1-32-queueinghint-brings-a-new-possibility-to-optimize-pod-schedulin/</link><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2024-12-12-kubernetes-v1-32-queueinghint-brings-a-new-possibility-to-optimize-pod-schedulin/</guid><description>Kubernetes v1.32: QueueingHint Brings a New Possibility to Optimize Pod Scheduling Scheduling queue Scheduling framework and plugins Improvements to retrying Pod scheduling with QueuingHint QueueingHint&amp;rsquo;s history and what&amp;rsquo;s new in v1.32 Getting involved How can I learn more? The Kubernetes scheduler is the core component that selects the nodes on which new Pods run. The scheduler processes these new Pods one by one. Therefore, the larger your clusters, the more important the throughput of the scheduler becomes. Over the years, Kubernetes SIG Scheduling has improved the throughput of the scheduler in multiple enhancements. This blog post describes a major improvement to the scheduler in Kubernetes v1.32: a scheduling context element named QueueingHint. This page provides background knowledge of the scheduler and explains how QueueingHint improves scheduling throughput. The scheduler stores all unscheduled Pods in an internal component called the scheduling queue. The scheduling queue consists of the following data structures: ActiveQ : holds newly created Pods or Pods that are ready to be retried for scheduling. BackoffQ : holds Pods that are ready to be retried but are waiting for a backoff period to end. The backoff period depends on the number of unsuccessful scheduling attempts performed by the scheduler on that Pod. Unschedulable Pod Pool : holds Pods that the scheduler won&amp;rsquo;t attempt to schedule for one of the following reasons: The scheduler previously attempted and was unable to schedule the Pods. Since that attempt, the cluster hasn&amp;rsquo;t changed in a way that could make those Pods schedulable.</description></item><item><title>Kubernetes v1.32: Penelope</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2024-12-11-kubernetes-v1-32-penelope/</link><pubDate>Wed, 11 Dec 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2024-12-11-kubernetes-v1-32-penelope/</guid><description>Kubernetes v1.32: Penelope Release theme and logo Updates to recent key features A note on DRA enhancements Quality of life improvements on nodes and sidecar containers update Highlights of features graduating to Stable Custom Resource field selectors Support to size memory backed volumes Bound service account token improvement Structured authorization configuration Auto remove PVCs created by StatefulSet Highlights of features graduating to Beta Job API managed-by mechanism Only allow anonymous auth for configured endpoints Per-plugin callback functions for accurate requeueing in kube-scheduler enhancements Recover from volume expansion failure Volume group snapshot Structured parameter support Label and field selector authorization Highlights of new features in Alpha Asynchronous preemption in the Kubernetes Scheduler Mutating admission policies using CEL expressions Pod-level resource specifications Allow zero value for sleep action of PreStop hook DRA: Standardized network interface data for resource claim status New statusz and flagz endpoints for core components Windows strikes back!

In line with previous releases, the release of Kubernetes v1.32 introduces new stable, beta, and alpha features. The consistent delivery of high-quality releases underscores the strength of our development cycle and the vibrant support from our community. This release consists of 44 enhancements in total. Of those enhancements, 13 have graduated to Stable, 12 are entering Beta, and 19 have entered in Alpha. The Kubernetes v1.32 Release Theme is &amp;ldquo;Penelope&amp;rdquo;. If Kubernetes is Ancient Greek for &amp;ldquo;pilot&amp;rdquo;, in this release we start from that origin and reflect on the last 10 years of Kubernetes and our accomplishments: each release cycle is a journey, and just like Penelope, in &amp;ldquo;The Odyssey&amp;rdquo;, weaved for 10 years &amp;ndash; each night removing parts of what she had done during the day &amp;ndash; so does each release add new features and removes others, albeit here with a much clearer purpose of constantly improving Kubernetes. With v1.32 being the last release in the year Kubernetes marks its first decade anniversary, we wanted to honour all of those that have been part of the global Kubernetes crew that roams the cloud-native seas through perils and challanges: may we continue to weave the future of Kubernetes together. In this release, like the previous one, the Kubernetes project continues proposing a number of enhancements to the Dynamic Resource Allocation (DRA), a key component of the Kubernetes resource management system. These enhancements aim to improve the flexibility and efficiency of resource allocation for workloads that require specialized hardware, such as GPUs, FPGAs and network adapters. These features are particularly useful for use-cases such as machine learning or high-performance computing applications. The core part enabling DRA Structured parameter support got promoted to beta. SIG Node has the following highlights that go beyond KEPs: The systemd watchdog capability is now used to restart the kubelet when its health check fails, while also limiting the maximum number of restarts within a given time period.</description></item><item><title>Gateway API v1.2: WebSockets, Timeouts, Retries, and More</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2024-11-21-gateway-api-v1-2-websockets-timeouts-retries-and-more/</link><pubDate>Thu, 21 Nov 2024 09:00:00 -0800</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2024-11-21-gateway-api-v1-2-websockets-timeouts-retries-and-more/</guid><description>Gateway API v1.2: WebSockets, Timeouts, Retries, and More Breaking changes GRPCRoute and ReferenceGrant v1alpha2 removal Change to. status. supportedFeatures (experimental) Graduations to the standard channel HTTPRoute timeouts Gateway infrastructure labels and annotations Backend protocol support New additions to experimental channel Named rules for *Route resources HTTPRoute retry support HTTPRoute percentage-based mirroring Additional backend TLS configuration More changes Project updates Release process improvements gwctl moves out Maintainer changes Try it out Get involved Related Kubernetes blog articles Kubernetes SIG Network is delighted to announce the general availability of Gateway API v1.2! This version of the API was released on October 3, and we&amp;rsquo;re delighted to report that we now have a number of conformant implementations of it for you to try out. Gateway API v1.2 brings a number of new features to the Standard channel (Gateway API&amp;rsquo;s GA release channel), introduces some new experimental features, and inaugurates our new release process — but it also brings two breaking changes that you&amp;rsquo;ll want to be careful of. v1alpha2 Now that the v1 versions of GRPCRoute and ReferenceGrant have graduated to Standard, the old v1alpha2 versions have been removed from both the Standard and Experimental channels, in order to ease the maintenance burden that perpetually supporting the old versions would place on the Gateway API community. v1 v1alpha2 Before upgrading to Gateway API v1.2, you&amp;rsquo;ll want to confirm that any implementations of Gateway API have been upgraded to support the v1 API version of these resources instead of the v1alpha2 API version. Note that even if you&amp;rsquo;ve been using v1 in your YAML manifests, a controller may still be using v1alpha2 which would cause it to fail during this upgrade. Additionally, Kubernetes itself goes to some effort to stop you from removing a CRD version that it thinks you&amp;rsquo;re using: check out the release notes for more information about what you need to do to safely upgrade. status. supportedFeatures A much smaller breaking change:. status. supportedFeatures in a Gateway is now a list of objects instead of a list of strings.</description></item><item><title>How we built a dynamic Kubernetes API Server for the API Aggregation Layer in Cozystack</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2024-11-21-how-we-built-a-dynamic-kubernetes-api-server-for-the-api-aggregation-layer-in-co/</link><pubDate>Thu, 21 Nov 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2024-11-21-how-we-built-a-dynamic-kubernetes-api-server-for-the-api-aggregation-layer-in-co/</guid><description>How we built a dynamic Kubernetes API Server for the API Aggregation Layer in Cozystack What Is the API Aggregation Layer?

Next Steps Conclusion Hi there! I&amp;rsquo;m Andrei Kvapil, but you might know me as @kvaps in communities dedicated to Kubernetes and cloud-native tools. In this article, I want to share how we implemented our own extension api-server in the open-source PaaS platform, Cozystack. Kubernetes truly amazes me with its powerful extensibility features. You&amp;rsquo;re probably already familiar with the controller concept and frameworks like kubebuilder and operator-sdk that help you implement it. In a nutshell, they allow you to extend your Kubernetes cluster by defining custom resources (CRDs) and writing additional controllers that handle your business logic for reconciling and managing these kinds of resources. This approach is well-documented, with a wealth of information available online on how to develop your own operators. However, this is not the only way to extend the Kubernetes API. For more complex scenarios such as implementing imperative logic, managing subresources, and dynamically generating responses—the Kubernetes API aggregation layer provides an effective alternative. Through the aggregation layer, you can develop a custom extension API server and seamlessly integrate it within the broader Kubernetes API framework. In this article, I will explore the API aggregation layer, the types of challenges it is well-suited to address, cases where it may be less appropriate, and how we utilized this model to implement our own extension API server in Cozystack. First, let&amp;rsquo;s get definitions straight to avoid any confusion down the road. The API aggregation layer is a feature in Kubernetes, while an extension api-server is a specific implementation of an API server for the aggregation layer.</description></item><item><title>Kubernetes v1.32 sneak peek</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2024-11-08-kubernetes-v1-32-sneak-peek/</link><pubDate>Fri, 08 Nov 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2024-11-08-kubernetes-v1-32-sneak-peek/</guid><description>As we get closer to the release date for Kubernetes v1. 32, the project develops and matures.

This blog outlines some of the planned changes for the Kubernetes v1. 32 release, that the release team feels you should be aware of, for the continued maintenance of your Kubernetes environment and keeping up to date with the latest changes. Information listed below is based on the current status of the v1. 32 release and may change before the actual release date. The Kubernetes project has a well-documented deprecation policy for features. This policy states that stable APIs may only be deprecated when a newer, stable version of that API is available and that APIs have a minimum lifetime for each stability level. A deprecated API has been marked for removal in a future Kubernetes release will continue to function until removal (at least one year from the deprecation). Its usage will result in a warning being displayed. Removed APIs are no longer available in the current version, so you must migrate to use the replacement instead.</description></item><item><title>Creating alerts from panels in Kubernetes Monitoring: an overlooked, powerhouse feature</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2024-11-04-creating-alerts-from-panels-in-kubernetes-monitoring-an-overlooked-powerhouse-fe/</link><pubDate>Mon, 04 Nov 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2024-11-04-creating-alerts-from-panels-in-kubernetes-monitoring-an-overlooked-powerhouse-fe/</guid><description>New in Grafana Alerting: a faster, more scalable way to manage your alerts in Grafana Alejandro Fraenkel Â· 5 Aug 2025 Â· 9 min read We built a brand new alert rules list page.

Interview with participants Keita Mochizuki ( NTT DATA Group Corporation ) Yoshiki Fujikane ( CyberAgent, Inc. ) Future of Kubernetes upstream training We are organizers of Kubernetes Upstream Training in Japan. Our team is composed of members who actively contribute to Kubernetes, including individuals who hold roles such as member, reviewer, approver, and chair. Our goal is to increase the number of Kubernetes contributors and foster the growth of the community. While Kubernetes community is friendly and collaborative, newcomers may find the first step of contributing to be a bit challenging. Our training program aims to lower that barrier and create an environment where even beginners can participate smoothly. Our training started in 2019 and is held 1 to 2 times a year. Initially, Kubernetes Upstream Training was conducted as a co-located event of KubeCon (Kubernetes Contributor Summit), but we launched Kubernetes Upstream Training in Japan with the aim of increasing Japanese contributors by hosting a similar event in Japan. Before the pandemic, the training was held in person, but since 2020, it has been conducted online. The training offers the following content for those who have not yet contributed to Kubernetes: Introduction to Kubernetes community Overview of Kubernetes codebase and how to create your first PR Tips and encouragement to lower participation barriers, such as language How to set up the development environment Hands-on session using kubernetes-sigs/contributor-playground At the beginning of the program, we explain why contributing to Kubernetes is important and who can contribute. We emphasize that contributing to Kubernetes allows you to make a global impact and that Kubernetes community is looking forward to your contributions! We also explain Kubernetes community, SIGs, and Working Groups. Next, we explain the roles and responsibilities of Member, Reviewer, Approver, Tech Lead, and Chair.</description></item><item><title>Monitoring Kubernetes: Why traditional techniques aren't enough</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2024-10-18-monitoring-kubernetes-why-traditional-techniques-aren-t-enough/</link><pubDate>Fri, 18 Oct 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2024-10-18-monitoring-kubernetes-why-traditional-techniques-aren-t-enough/</guid><description>Kubernetes Monitoring backend 2.2: better cluster observability through new alert and recording.

In this interview, Sandeep Kanabar , a deaf member of the DHHWG and part of the Kubernetes SIG ContribEx Communications team , sits down with Catherine to explore the impact of the DHHWG on cloud native projects like Kubernetes. Sandeep’s journey is a testament to the power of inclusion. Through his involvement in the DHHWG, he connected with members of the Kubernetes community who encouraged him to join SIG ContribEx - the group responsible for sustaining the Kubernetes contributor experience. In an ecosystem where open-source projects are actively seeking contributors and maintainers, this story highlights how important it is to create pathways for underrepresented groups, including those with disabilities, to contribute their unique perspectives and skills. In this interview, we delve into Catherine’s journey, the challenges and triumphs of establishing the DHHWG, and the vision for a more inclusive future in cloud native. We invite Kubernetes contributors, maintainers, and community members to reflect on the significance of empathy, advocacy, and community in fostering a truly inclusive environment for all, and to think about how they can support efforts to increase diversity and accessibility within their own projects. Sandeep Kanabar (SK): Hello Catherine, could you please introduce yourself, share your professional background, and explain your connection to the Kubernetes ecosystem? Catherine Paganini (CP) : I’m the Head of Marketing at Buoyant , the creator of Linkerd , the CNCF-graduated service mesh, and 5th CNCF project. Four years ago, I started contributing to open source.

Firstly, I got to know about GSoC and Kubeflow with the recommendation from the former active maintainer Ce Gao(gaocegege)’s personal blog. And I was deeply impressed by the idea of cloud native AI toolkits, I decided to dive into this area and learn some skills to enhance my career and future. In the blog, I’ll provide my personal insight into Katib, for those who are interested in cloud native, AI, and hyperparameters tuning. The project aims to provide a Python SDK API interface for users to push metrics to Katib DB directly. The current implementation of Metrics Collector is pull-based, raising design problems such as determining the frequency at which we scrape the metrics, performance issues like the overhead caused by too many sidecar containers, and restrictions on developing environments that must support sidecar containers and admission webhooks. And also, for data scientists, they need to pay attention to the format of metrics printed in the training scripts, which is error prone and may be hard to recognize. We decided to implement a new API for Katib Python SDK to offer users a push-based way to store metrics directly into the Kaitb DB and resolve those issues raised by pull-based metrics collection. In the new design, users just need to set metrics_collector_config={&amp;ldquo;kind&amp;rdquo;: &amp;ldquo;Push&amp;rdquo;} in the tune() function and call the report_metrics() API in their objective function to push metrics to Katib DB directly. There are no sidecar containers and restricted metric log formats any more. After that, Trial Controller will continuously collect metrics from Katib DB and update the status of Trial, which is the same as pull-based metrics collection. metrics_collector_config={&amp;ldquo;kind&amp;rdquo;: &amp;ldquo;Push&amp;rdquo;} tune() report_metrics() If you are interested in it, please refer to this doc and example for more details.</description></item><item><title>Blog: Spotlight on SIG Scheduling</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2024-09-24-blog-spotlight-on-sig-scheduling/</link><pubDate>Tue, 24 Sep 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2024-09-24-blog-spotlight-on-sig-scheduling/</guid><description>Spotlight on SIG Scheduling Introductions About SIG Scheduling Contributing to SIG Scheduling Future Directions Closing Remarks In this SIG Scheduling spotlight we talked with Kensei Nakada , an approver in SIG Scheduling.

Kensei : Hi, thanks for the opportunity! I’m Kensei Nakada ( @sanposhiho ), a software engineer at Tetrate. io. I have been contributing to Kubernetes in my free time for more than 3 years, and now I’m an approver of SIG Scheduling in Kubernetes. Also, I’m a founder/owner of two SIG subprojects, kube-scheduler-simulator and kube-scheduler-wasm-extension. AP: That’s awesome! You’ve been involved with the project since a long time. Can you provide a brief overview of SIG Scheduling and explain its role within the Kubernetes ecosystem? KN : As the name implies, our responsibility is to enhance scheduling within Kubernetes. Specifically, we develop the components that determine which Node is the best place for each Pod. In Kubernetes, our main focus is on maintaining the kube-scheduler , along with other scheduling-related components as part of our SIG subprojects. That makes me curious–what recent innovations or developments has SIG Scheduling introduced to Kubernetes scheduling? KN : From a feature perspective, there have been several enhancements to PodTopologySpread recently. PodTopologySpread is a relatively new feature in the scheduler, and we are still in the process of gathering feedback and making improvements.

My project focused on developing a high-level API for optimizing hyperparameters in Large Language Models (LLMs) within Katib, Kubeflow’s automated hyperparameter tuning system. I’d like to share insights from this experience with others interested in Kubeflow, GSoC, or optimizing LLMs. The rapid advancements and rising popularity of LLMs, such as GPT and BERT, have created a growing demand for efficient LLMOps in Kubernetes. To address this, we have developed a train API within the Training Python SDK, simplifying the process of fine-tuning LLMs using distributed PyTorchJob workers. However, hyperparameter optimization remains a crucial yet labor-intensive task for enhancing model performance. Hyperparameter optimization is essential but time-consuming, especially for LLMs with billions of parameters. This API simplifies the process by handling Kubernetes infrastructure, allowing data scientists to focus on model performance rather than system configuration. With this API, users can import pretrained models and datasets from Hugging Face and Amazon S3, define parameters including the hyperparameter search space, optimization objective, and resource configuration. The API then automates the creation of Experiment, which contains multiple Trials with different hyperparameter settings using PyTorch distributed training.

Frederico (FSM): Hello, and thank your for your time. To start with, could you tell us about yourselves and how you got involved in Kubernetes? David : I started working on OpenShift (the Red Hat distribution of Kubernetes) in the fall of 2014 and got involved pretty quickly in API Machinery. My first PRs were fixing kube-apiserver error messages and from there I branched out to kubectl ( kubeconfigs are my fault!), auth ( RBAC and *Review APIs are ports from OpenShift), apps ( workqueues and sharedinformers for example). Don’t tell the others, but API Machinery is still my favorite :) kubectl auth *Review apps Federico : I was not as early in Kubernetes as David, but now it’s been more than six years. At my previous company we were starting to use Kubernetes for our own products, and when I came across the opportunity to work directly with Kubernetes I left everything and boarded the ship (no pun intended). I joined Google and Kubernetes in early 2018, and have been involved since. FSM: It only takes a quick look at the SIG API Machinery charter to see that it has quite a significant scope, nothing less than the Kubernetes control plane. Could you describe this scope in your own words? David : We own the kube-apiserver and how to efficiently use it. On the backend, that includes its contract with backend storage and how it allows API schema evolution over time. On the frontend, that includes schema best practices, serialization, client patterns, and controller patterns on top of all of it. kube-apiserver Federico : Kubernetes has a lot of different components, but the control plane has a really critical mission: it’s your communication layer with the cluster and also owns all the extensibility mechanisms that make Kubernetes so powerful.</description></item><item><title>Monitor these Kubernetes signals to help rightsize your fleet</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2024-07-29-monitor-these-kubernetes-signals-to-help-rightsize-your-fleet/</link><pubDate>Mon, 29 Jul 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2024-07-29-monitor-these-kubernetes-signals-to-help-rightsize-your-fleet/</guid><description>Kubernetes Monitoring backend 2.2: better cluster observability through new alert and recording.

This is where conformance testing becomes crucial, verifying that a Kubernetes cluster meets the required standards set by the community. Today, we’re thrilled to introduce Hydrophone , a lightweight runner designed to streamline Kubernetes tests using the official conformance images released by the Kubernetes release team. Hydrophone’s design philosophy centers around ease of use. By starting the conformance image as a pod within the conformance namespace, Hydrophone waits for the tests to conclude, then prints and exports the results. This approach offers a hassle-free method for running either individual tests or the entire Conformance Test Suite. Ease of Use : Designed with simplicity in mind, Hydrophone provides an easy-to-use tool for conducting Kubernetes conformance tests. Official Conformance Images : It leverages the official conformance images from the Kubernetes Release Team, ensuring that you’re using the most up-to-date and reliable resources for testing. Flexible Test Execution : Whether you need to run a single test, the entire Conformance Test Suite, or anything in between. In the Kubernetes world, where providers like EKS, Rancher, and k3s offer diverse environments, ensuring consistent experiences is vital. This consistency is anchored in conformance testing, which validates whether these environments adhere to Kubernetes community standards. Historically, this validation has either been cumbersome or requires third-party tools.</description></item><item><title>Blog: Migrate to Google Artifact Registry</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2024-05-06-blog-migrate-to-google-artifact-registry/</link><pubDate>Mon, 06 May 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2024-05-06-blog-migrate-to-google-artifact-registry/</guid><description>Migrate to Google Artifact Registry Google has announced that container registry will be shut down some time after March 18, 2025.

What’s Next? Join the Movement We’re excited to announce the migration of Google’s Spark Operator to the Kubeflow Spark Operator , marking the launch of a significant addition to the Kubeflow ecosystem. The Kubeflow Spark Operator simplifies the deployment and management of Apache Spark applications on Kubernetes. This announcement isn’t just about a new piece of technology, it’s about building a stronger, open-governed, and more collaborative community around Spark on Kubernetes. The journey of the Kubeflow Spark Operator began with Google Cloud Platform’s Spark on Kubernetes Operator (https://cloud. google. com/blog/products/data-analytics/data-analytics-meet-containers-kubernetes-operator-for-apache-spark-now-in-beta). With over 2. 3k stars and 1. 3k forks on GitHub, this project laid the foundation for a robust Spark on Kubernetes experience, enabling users to deploy Spark workloads seamlessly across Kubernetes clusters. Growth and innovation require not just code but also community. Acknowledging the resource and time limitations faced by Google Cloud’s original maintainers, Kubeflow has taken up the mantle. This transition is not merely administrative but a strategic move towards fostering a vibrant, diverse, and more actively engaged community.</description></item><item><title>Blog: Spotlight on SIG Architecture: Code Organization</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2024-04-11-blog-spotlight-on-sig-architecture-code-organization/</link><pubDate>Thu, 11 Apr 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2024-04-11-blog-spotlight-on-sig-architecture-code-organization/</guid><description>Spotlight on SIG Architecture: Code Organization Introducing the Code Organization subproject Code organization and Kubernetes Release cycle and current priorities Wrapping up This is the third interview of a SIG Architecture Spotlight series that will cover the different subprojects. We will cover SIG Architecture: Code Organization. In this SIG Architecture spotlight I talked with Madhav Jivrajani (VMware), a member of the Code Organization subproject. Frederico (FSM) : Hello Madhav, thank you for your availability. Could you start by telling us a bit about yourself, your role and how you got involved in Kubernetes? Madhav Jivrajani (MJ) : Hello! My name is Madhav Jivrajani, I serve as a technical lead for SIG Contributor Experience and a GitHub Admin for the Kubernetes project. Apart from that I also contribute to SIG API Machinery and SIG Etcd, but more recently, I’ve been helping out with the work that is needed to help Kubernetes stay on supported versions of Go , and it is through this that I am involved with the Code Organization subproject of SIG Architecture. FSM : A project the size of Kubernetes must have unique challenges in terms of code organization – is this a fair assumption? If so, what would you pick as some of the main challenges that are specific to Kubernetes? MJ : That’s a fair assumption! The first interesting challenge comes from the sheer size of the Kubernetes codebase. We have ≅2.2 million lines of Go code (which is steadily decreasing thanks to dims and other folks in this sub-project!), and a little over 240 dependencies that we rely on either directly or indirectly, which is why having a sub-project dedicated to helping out with dependency management is crucial: we need to know what dependencies we’re pulling in, what versions these dependencies are at, and tooling to help make sure we are managing these dependencies across different parts of the codebase in a consistent manner. Another interesting challenge with Kubernetes is that we publish a lot of Go modules as part of the Kubernetes release cycles, one example of this is client-go. However, we as a project would also like the benefits of having everything in one repository to get the advantages of using a monorepo, like atomic commits… so, because of this, code organization works with other SIGs (like SIG Release) to automate the process of publishing code from the monorepo to downstream individual repositories which are much easier to consume, and this way you won’t have to import the entire Kubernetes codebase! client-go FSM : For someone just starting contributing to Kubernetes code-wise, what are the main things they should consider in terms of code organization? How would you sum up the key concepts? MJ : I think one of the key things to keep in mind at least as you’re starting off is the concept of staging directories. In the kubernetes/kubernetes repository, you will come across a directory called staging/. The sub-folders in this directory serve as a bunch of pseudo-repositories.</description></item><item><title>Blog: Using Go workspaces in Kubernetes</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2024-03-19-blog-using-go-workspaces-in-kubernetes/</link><pubDate>Tue, 19 Mar 2024 08:30:00 -0800</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2024-03-19-blog-using-go-workspaces-in-kubernetes/</guid><description>Using Go workspaces in Kubernetes GOPATH and Go modules The problems Enter workspaces The work Results Thanks The Go programming language has played a huge role in the success of Kubernetes. As Kubernetes has grown, matured, and pushed the bounds of what “regular” projects do, the Go project team has also grown and evolved the language and tools. In recent releases, Go introduced a feature called “workspaces” which was aimed at making projects like Kubernetes easier to manage. We’ve just completed a major effort to adopt workspaces in Kubernetes, and the results are great. Our codebase is simpler and less error-prone, and we’re no longer off on our own technology island. Kubernetes is one of the most visible open source projects written in Go. The earliest versions of Kubernetes, dating back to 2014, were built with Go 1.3. Today, 10 years later, Go is up to version 1.22 — and let’s just say that a whole lot has changed. In 2014, Go development was entirely based on GOPATH. As a Go project, Kubernetes lived by the rules of GOPATH. In the buildup to Kubernetes 1.4 (mid 2016), we introduced a directory tree called staging. This allowed us to pretend to be multiple projects, but still exist within one git repository (which had advantages for development velocity).</description></item><item><title>Grafana Labs at KubeCon: eBPF, sustainability, Prometheus, and more</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2024-03-15-grafana-labs-at-kubecon-ebpf-sustainability-prometheus-and-more/</link><pubDate>Fri, 15 Mar 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2024-03-15-grafana-labs-at-kubecon-ebpf-sustainability-prometheus-and-more/</guid><description>How to monitor your homelab with Beyla, eBPF, and OpenTelemetry Colin Steele Â· 22 Aug 2025 Â· 5 min read Learn how Beyla, eBPF, and OpenTelemetry combine to make homelab observability easy with this recap of a recent GrafanaCON 2025 session.</description></item><item><title>Blog: Spotlight on SIG Cloud Provider</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2024-03-01-blog-spotlight-on-sig-cloud-provider/</link><pubDate>Fri, 01 Mar 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2024-03-01-blog-spotlight-on-sig-cloud-provider/</guid><description>Spotlight on SIG Cloud Provider Introduction Functioning and working Important subprojects Accomplishments Advice for new contributors One of the most popular ways developers use Kubernetes-related services is via cloud providers, but have you ever wondered how cloud providers can do that? How does this whole process of integration of Kubernetes to various cloud providers happen? To answer that, let’s put the spotlight on SIG Cloud Provider. SIG Cloud Provider works to create seamless integrations between Kubernetes and various cloud providers. Their mission? Keeping the Kubernetes ecosystem fair and open for all. By setting clear standards and requirements, they ensure every cloud provider plays nicely with Kubernetes. It is their responsibility to configure cluster components to enable cloud provider integrations. In this blog of the SIG Spotlight series, Arujjwal Negi interviews Michael McCune (Red Hat), also known as elmiko , co-chair of SIG Cloud Provider, to give us an insight into the workings of this group. Arujjwal : Let’s start by getting to know you. Can you give us a small intro about yourself and how you got into Kubernetes? Michael : Hi, I’m Michael McCune, most people around the community call me by my handle, elmiko. I’ve been a software developer for a long time now (Windows 3.1 was popular when I started!), and I’ve been involved with open-source software for most of my career. I first got involved with Kubernetes as a developer of machine learning and data science applications; the team I was on at the time was creating tutorials and examples to demonstrate the use of technologies like Apache Spark on Kubernetes. That said, I’ve been interested in distributed systems for many years and when an opportunity arose to join a team working directly on Kubernetes, I jumped at it! Arujjwal : Can you give us an insight into what SIG Cloud Provider does and how it functions? Michael : SIG Cloud Provider was formed to help ensure that Kubernetes provides a neutral integration point for all infrastructure providers. Our largest task to date has been the extraction and migration of in-tree cloud controllers to out-of-tree components.</description></item><item><title>Blog: A look into the Kubernetes Book Club</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2024-02-22-blog-a-look-into-the-kubernetes-book-club/</link><pubDate>Thu, 22 Feb 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2024-02-22-blog-a-look-into-the-kubernetes-book-club/</guid><description>A look into the Kubernetes Book Club Creating the Book Club Topics covered in the Book Club Joining the Book Club Learning Kubernetes and the entire ecosystem of technologies around it is not without its challenges. In this interview, we will talk with Carlos Santana (AWS) to learn a bit more about how he created the Kubernetes Book Club , how it works, and how anyone can join in to take advantage of a community-based learning experience. Frederico Muñoz (FSM) : Hello Carlos, thank you so much for your availability. To start with, could you tell us a bit about yourself? Carlos Santana (CS) : Of course. My experience in deploying Kubernetes in production six years ago opened the door for me to join Knative and then contribute to Kubernetes through the Release Team. Working on upstream Kubernetes has been one of the best experiences I’ve had in open-source. Over the past two years, in my role as a Senior Specialist Solutions Architect at AWS, I have been assisting large enterprises build their internal developer platforms (IDP) on top of Kubernetes. Going forward, my open source contributions are directed towards CNOE and CNCF projects like Argo , Crossplane , and Backstage. FSM : So your path led you to Kubernetes, and at that point what was the motivating factor for starting the Book Club? CS : The idea for the Kubernetes Book Club sprang from a casual suggestion during a TGIK livestream. For me, it was more than just about reading a book; it was about creating a learning community. This platform has not only been a source of knowledge but also a support system, especially during the challenging times of the pandemic. It’s gratifying to see how this initiative has helped members cope and grow.</description></item><item><title>Kubernetes alerting: Simplify anomaly detection in Kubernetes clusters with Grafana Cloud</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2024-02-15-kubernetes-alerting-simplify-anomaly-detection-in-kubernetes-clusters-with-grafa/</link><pubDate>Thu, 15 Feb 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2024-02-15-kubernetes-alerting-simplify-anomaly-detection-in-kubernetes-clusters-with-grafa/</guid><description>New in Grafana Alerting: a faster, more scalable way to manage your alerts in Grafana Alejandro Fraenkel Â· 5 Aug 2025 Â· 9 min read We built a brand new alert rules list page.

Have you ever considered how such a big project like Kubernetes manages its timeline so efficiently to release its new version, or how the internal workings of the Release Team look like? If you’re curious about these questions or want to know more and get involved with the work SIG Release does, read on! SIG Release plays a crucial role in the development and evolution of Kubernetes. Its primary responsibility is to manage the release process of new versions of Kubernetes. It operates on a regular release cycle, typically every three to four months. During this cycle, the Kubernetes Release Team works closely with other SIGs and contributors to ensure a smooth and well-coordinated release. This includes planning the release schedule, setting deadlines for code freeze and testing phases, as well as creating release artefacts like binaries, documentation, and release notes. Before you read further, it is important to note that there are two subprojects under SIG Release - Release Engineering and Release Team. In this blog post, Nitish Kumar interviews Verónica López (PlanetScale), Technical Lead of SIG Release, with the spotlight on the Release Team subproject, how the release process looks like, and ways to get involved. What is the typical release process for a new version of Kubernetes, from initial planning to the final release? Are there any specific methodologies and tools that you use to ensure a smooth release? The release process for a new Kubernetes version is a well-structured and community-driven effort. There are no specific methodologies or tools as such that we follow, except a calendar with a series of steps to keep things organised.

This project started as a fun experiment using emerging technologies and is intended to become a utility for CI and testing to help facilitate the continued development of Gateway API. Are you interested in developing networking tools in Rust and eBPF ? Or perhaps you’re specifically interested in Gateway API? We’ll tell you a bit about the project and how it might benefit you. Blixt originated at Kong as an experiment to test load-balancing ingress traffic for Kubernetes clusters using eBPF for the dataplane. Around the time of Kubecon Detroit (2022) we (the Gateway API maintainers) realized it had significant potential to help us move our TCPRoute and UDPRoute support forward, which had been sort of “stuck in alpha” at the time due to a lack of conformance tests being developed for them. At the same time, various others in the SIG Network community developed an interest in the project due to the rapid growth of eBPFs use on Kubernetes. Given the potential for benefit to the Kubernetes ecosystem and the growing interest, Kong decided it would be helpful to donate the project to Kubernetes SIGs to benefit upstream Kubernetes. Over several months we rewrote the project in Rust (from C), due to a strong contingency of Rust knowledge (and interest) between us developing the project and an active interest in the burgeoning Aya project (a Rust framework for developing eBPF programs). We did eventually move the control plane (specifically) to Golang however, so that we could take advantage of the Kubebuilder and controller-runtime ecosystems. Additionally, we augmented our custom program loader (in eBPF, you generally write loaders that load your BPF byte code into the kernel) with bpfman : a project adjacent to us in the Rust + eBPF ecosystem, which helps solve several security and ergonomic problems with managing BPF programs on Linux systems. After the recently completed license review process , which provided a blanket exception for the use of dual licensed eBPF in CNCF code, the project became officially part of Kubernetes and interest has been growing. We have several goals for the project which revolve around the continued development of Gateway API, with a specific focus on helping mature Layer 4 support (e.</description></item><item><title>Blog: Kubernetes supports running kube-proxy in an unprivileged container</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2024-01-05-blog-kubernetes-supports-running-kube-proxy-in-an-unprivileged-container/</link><pubDate>Fri, 05 Jan 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2024-01-05-blog-kubernetes-supports-running-kube-proxy-in-an-unprivileged-container/</guid><description>Kubernetes supports running kube-proxy in an unprivileged container Background Initializing kube-proxy in an init container Summary This post describes how the &amp;ndash;init-only flag to kube-proxy can be used to run the main kube-proxy container in a stricter securityContext , by performing the configuration that requires privileged mode in a separate init container. Since Windows doesn’t have the equivalent of capabilities , this only works on Linux. &amp;ndash;init-only kube-proxy securityContext capabilities The kube-proxy Pod still only meets the privileged Pod Security Standard , but there is still an improvement because the running container doesn’t need to run privileged. kube-proxy Please note that kube-proxy can be installed in different ways.

In theory, then, if a privileged init container set the sysctls to the right values, then kube-proxy could run unprivileged. kube-proxy kube-proxy kube-proxy The problem is to know what to setup. Until now the only option has been to read the source to see what changes kube-proxy would have made, but with &amp;ndash;init-only you can have kube-proxy itself do the setup exactly as on a normal start, and then exit.</description></item><item><title>Blog: Contextual logging in Kubernetes 1.29: Better troubleshooting and enhanced logging</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2023-12-20-blog-contextual-logging-in-kubernetes-1-29-better-troubleshooting-and-enhanced-l/</link><pubDate>Wed, 20 Dec 2023 09:30:00 -0800</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2023-12-20-blog-contextual-logging-in-kubernetes-1-29-better-troubleshooting-and-enhanced-l/</guid><description>Contextual logging in Kubernetes 1.29: Better troubleshooting and enhanced logging What is contextual logging? How to use it Performance impact Impact on downstream users Further reading Get involved On behalf of the Structured Logging Working Group and SIG Instrumentation , we are pleased to announce that the contextual logging feature introduced in Kubernetes v1.24 has now been successfully migrated to two components (kube-scheduler and kube-controller-manager) as well as some directories. This feature aims to provide more useful logs for better troubleshooting of Kubernetes and to empower developers to enhance Kubernetes. Contextual logging is based on the go-logr API. The key idea is that libraries are passed a logger instance by their caller and use that for logging instead of accessing a global logger. The binary decides the logging implementation, not the libraries. The go-logr API is designed around structured logging and supports attaching additional information to a logger. This enables additional use cases: The caller can attach additional information to a logger: WithName adds a “logger” key with the names concatenated by a dot as value WithValues adds key/value pairs When passing this extended logger into a function, and the function uses it instead of the global logger, the additional information is then included in all log entries, without having to modify the code that generates the log entries. This is useful in highly parallel applications where it can become hard to identify all log entries for a certain operation, because the output from different operations gets interleaved.

Then, when a test fails, only the log output of the failed test gets shown by go test.</description></item><item><title>Blog: Spotlight on SIG Testing</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2023-11-24-blog-spotlight-on-sig-testing/</link><pubDate>Fri, 24 Nov 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2023-11-24-blog-spotlight-on-sig-testing/</guid><description>Spotlight on SIG Testing Meet the contributors Testing practices and tools Subprojects owned by SIG Testing Key challenges and accomplishments The people and the scope Looking ahead Welcome to another edition of the SIG spotlight blog series, where we highlight the incredible work being done by various Special Interest Groups (SIGs) within the Kubernetes project. In this edition, we turn our attention to SIG Testing , a group interested in effective testing of Kubernetes and automating away project toil. SIG Testing focus on creating and running tools and infrastructure that make it easier for the community to write and run tests, and to contribute, analyze and act upon test results. To gain some insights into SIG Testing, Sandipan Panda spoke with Michelle Shepardson , a senior software engineer at Google and a chair of SIG Testing, and Patrick Ohly , a software engineer and architect at Intel and a SIG Testing Tech Lead. Sandipan: Could you tell us a bit about yourself, your role, and how you got involved in the Kubernetes project and SIG Testing? Michelle: Hi! I’m Michelle, a senior software engineer at Google. I first got involved in Kubernetes through working on tooling for SIG Testing, like the external instance of TestGrid. I’m part of oncall for TestGrid and Prow, and am now a chair for the SIG. Patrick: Hello! I work as a software engineer and architect in a team at Intel which focuses on open source Cloud Native projects. When I ramped up on Kubernetes to develop a storage driver, my very first question was “how do I test it in a cluster and how do I log information?” That interest led to various enhancement proposals until I had (re)written enough code that also took over official roles as SIG Testing Tech Lead (for the E2E framework ) and structured logging WG lead. Sandipan: Testing is a field in which multiple approaches and tools exist; how did you arrive at the existing practices? Patrick: I can’t speak about the early days because I wasn’t around yet 😆, but looking back at some of the commit history it’s pretty obvious that developers just took what was available and started using it. For E2E testing, that was Ginkgo+Gomega. Some hacks were necessary, for example around cleanup after a test run and for categorising tests.</description></item><item><title>Blog: Kubernetes Contributor Summit: Behind-the-scenes</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2023-11-03-blog-kubernetes-contributor-summit-behind-the-scenes/</link><pubDate>Fri, 03 Nov 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2023-11-03-blog-kubernetes-contributor-summit-behind-the-scenes/</guid><description>Kubernetes Contributor Summit: Behind-the-scenes The Contributor Summit What makes it special Organizing the Summit A look ahead Every year, just before the official start of KubeCon+CloudNativeCon, there’s a special event that has a very special place in the hearts of those organizing and participating in it: the Kubernetes Contributor Summit. To find out why, and to provide a behind-the-scenes perspective, we interview Noah Abrahams, whom amongst other roles was the co-lead for the Kubernetes Contributor Summit in 2023. Frederico Muñoz (FSM) : Hello Noah, and welcome. Could you start by introducing yourself and telling us how you got involved in Kubernetes? Noah Abrahams (NA) : I’ve been in this space for quite a while. I got started in IT in the mid 90’s, and I’ve been working in the “Cloud” space for about 15 years. It was, frankly, through a combination of sheer luck (being in the right place at the right time) and having good mentors to pull me into those places (thanks, Tim!), that I ended up at a startup called Apprenda in 2016. While I was there, they pivoted into Kubernetes, and it was the best thing that could have happened to my career. It was around v1.2 and someone asked me if I could give a presentation on Kubernetes concepts at “my local meetup” in Las Vegas. The meetup didn’t exist yet, so I created it, and got involved in the wider community. One thing led to another, and soon I was involved in ContribEx, joined the release team, was doing booth duty for the CNCF, became an ambassador, and here we are today. FM : Before leading the organisation of the KCSEU 2023, how many other Contributor Summits were you a part of? NA : I was involved in four or five before taking the lead. If I’m recalling correctly, I attended the summit in Copenhagen, then sometime in 2018 I joined the wrong meeting, because the summit staff meeting was listed on the ContribEx calendar.</description></item><item><title>Blog: Spotlight on SIG Architecture: Production Readiness</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2023-11-02-blog-spotlight-on-sig-architecture-production-readiness/</link><pubDate>Thu, 02 Nov 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2023-11-02-blog-spotlight-on-sig-architecture-production-readiness/</guid><description>Spotlight on SIG Architecture: Production Readiness About SIG Architecture and the Production Readiness subproject Production readiness and the Kubernetes project Helping with Production Readiness This is the second interview of a SIG Architecture Spotlight series that will cover the different subprojects. In this blog, we will cover the SIG Architecture: Production Readiness subproject. In this SIG Architecture spotlight, we talked with Wojciech Tyczynski (Google), lead of the Production Readiness subproject. Frederico (FSM) : Hello Wojciech, could you tell us a bit about yourself, your role and how you got involved in Kubernetes? Wojciech Tyczynski (WT) : I started contributing to Kubernetes in January 2015. At that time, Google (where I was and still am working) decided to start a Kubernetes team in the Warsaw office (in addition to already existing teams in California and Seattle). I was lucky enough to be one of the seeding engineers for that team. After two months of onboarding and helping with different tasks across the project towards 1.0 launch, I took ownership of the scalability area and I was leading Kubernetes to support clusters with 5000 nodes. I’m still involved in SIG Scalability as its Technical Lead. That was the start of a journey since scalability is such a cross-cutting topic, and I started contributing to many other areas including, over time, to SIG Architecture. FSM : In SIG Architecture, why specifically the Production Readiness subproject? Was it something you had in mind from the start, or was it an unexpected consequence of your initial involvement in scalability? WT : After reaching that milestone of Kubernetes supporting 5000-node clusters , one of the goals was to ensure that Kubernetes would not degrade its scalability properties over time. While non-scalable implementation is always fixable, designing non-scalable APIs or contracts is problematic. I was looking for a way to ensure that people are thinking about scalability when they create new features and capabilities without introducing too much overhead.</description></item><item><title>Blog: A Quick Recap of 2023 China Kubernetes Contributor Summit</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2023-10-20-blog-a-quick-recap-of-2023-china-kubernetes-contributor-summit/</link><pubDate>Fri, 20 Oct 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2023-10-20-blog-a-quick-recap-of-2023-china-kubernetes-contributor-summit/</guid><description>A Quick Recap of 2023 China Kubernetes Contributor Summit A joyful meetup Technical sharing and discussions China’s contributor statistics Acknowledgments On September 26, 2023, the first day of KubeCon + CloudNativeCon + Open Source Summit China 2023 , nearly 50 contributors gathered in Shanghai for the Kubernetes Contributor Summit. All participants in the 2023 Kubernetes Contributor Summit This marked the first in-person offline gathering held in China after three years of the pandemic. The event began with welcome speeches from Kevin Wang from Huawei Cloud, one of the co-chairs of KubeCon, and Puja from Giant Swarm. Following the opening remarks, the contributors introduced themselves briefly. Most attendees were from China, while some contributors had made the journey from Europe and the United States specifically for the conference. Technical experts from companies such as Microsoft, Intel, Huawei, as well as emerging forces like DaoCloud, were present. Laughter and cheerful voices filled the room, regardless of whether English was spoken with European or American accents or if conversations were carried out in authentic Chinese language. This created an atmosphere of comfort, joy, respect, and anticipation. Past contributions brought everyone closer, and mutual recognition and accomplishments made this offline gathering possible. Face to face meeting in Shanghai The attending contributors were no longer just GitHub IDs; they transformed into vivid faces. From sitting together and capturing group photos to attempting to identify “Who is who,” a loosely connected collective emerged. This team structure, although loosely knit and free-spirited, was established to pursue shared dreams.</description></item><item><title>Blog: Spotlight on SIG Architecture: Conformance</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2023-10-05-blog-spotlight-on-sig-architecture-conformance/</link><pubDate>Thu, 05 Oct 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2023-10-05-blog-spotlight-on-sig-architecture-conformance/</guid><description>Spotlight on SIG Architecture: Conformance About SIG Architecture and the Conformance subproject More on the Conformance Test Suite This is the first interview of a SIG Architecture Spotlight series that will cover the different subprojects.

Frederico (FSM) : Hello Riaan, and welcome! For starters, tell us a bit about yourself, your role and how you got involved in Kubernetes. Riaan Kleinhans (RK) : Hi! My name is Riaan Kleinhans and I live in South Africa. I am the Project manager for the ii-Team in New Zealand. When I joined ii the plan was to move to New Zealand in April 2020 and then Covid happened. Fortunately, being a flexible and dynamic team we were able to make it work remotely and in very different time zones. The ii. nz team have been tasked with managing the Kubernetes Conformance testing technical debt and writing tests to clear the technical debt. I stepped into the role of project manager to be the link between monitoring, test writing and the community. Through that work I had the privilege of meeting the late Dan Kohn in those first months, his enthusiasm about the work we were doing was a great inspiration. FSM : Thank you - so, your involvement in SIG Architecture started because of the conformance work? RK : SIG Architecture is the home for the Kubernetes Conformance subproject.</description></item><item><title>Blog: Announcing the 2023 Steering Committee Election Results</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2023-10-02-blog-announcing-the-2023-steering-committee-election-results/</link><pubDate>Mon, 02 Oct 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2023-10-02-blog-announcing-the-2023-steering-committee-election-results/</guid><description>Announcing the 2023 Steering Committee Election Results Results Big Thanks!

Sub-projects under SIG ContribEx Accomplishments Upcoming initiatives Final thoughts What next? Author : Fyka Ansari Welcome to the world of Kubernetes and its vibrant contributor community! In this blog post, we’ll be shining a spotlight on the Special Interest Group for Contributor Experience (SIG ContribEx), an essential component of the Kubernetes project. SIG ContribEx in Kubernetes is responsible for developing and maintaining a healthy and productive community of contributors to the project. This involves identifying and addressing bottlenecks that may hinder the project’s growth and feature velocity, such as pull request latency and the number of open pull requests and issues. SIG ContribEx works to improve the overall contributor experience by creating and maintaining guidelines, tools, and processes that facilitate collaboration and communication among contributors. They also focus on community building and support, including outreach programs and mentorship initiatives to onboard and retain new contributors. Ultimately, the role of SIG ContribEx is to foster a welcoming and inclusive environment that encourages contribution and supports the long-term sustainability of the Kubernetes project. In this blog post, Fyka Ansari interviews Kaslin Fields , a DevRel Engineer at Google, who is a chair of SIG ContribEx, and Madhav Jivrajani , a Software Engineer at VMWare who serves as a SIG ContribEx Tech Lead. This interview covers various aspects of SIG ContribEx, including current initiatives, exciting developments, and how interested individuals can get involved and contribute to the group. It provides valuable insights into the workings of SIG ContribEx and highlights the importance of its role in the Kubernetes ecosystem. Fyka: Let’s start by diving into your background and how you got involved in the Kubernetes ecosystem. Can you tell us more about that journey? Kaslin: I first got involved in the Kubernetes ecosystem through my mentor, Jonathan Rippy, who introduced me to containers during my early days in tech. Eventually, I transitioned to a team working with containers, which sparked my interest in Kubernetes when it was announced.</description></item><item><title>Blog: Spotlight on SIG CLI</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2023-07-20-blog-spotlight-on-sig-cli/</link><pubDate>Thu, 20 Jul 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2023-07-20-blog-spotlight-on-sig-cli/</guid><description>Spotlight on SIG CLI Introductions About SIG CLI Current projects and challenges Future plans and contribution In the world of Kubernetes, managing containerized applications at scale requires powerful and efficient tools. The command-line interface (CLI) is an integral part of any developer or operator’s toolkit, offering a convenient and flexible way to interact with a Kubernetes cluster. SIG CLI plays a crucial role in improving the Kubernetes CLI experience by focusing on the development and enhancement of kubectl , the primary command-line tool for Kubernetes. kubectl In this SIG CLI Spotlight, Arpit Agrawal, SIG ContribEx-Comms team member, talked with Katrina Verey , Tech Lead &amp;amp; Chair of SIG CLI,and Maciej Szulik , SIG CLI Batch Lead, about SIG CLI, current projects, challenges and how anyone can get involved. So, whether you are a seasoned Kubernetes enthusiast or just getting started, understanding the significance of SIG CLI will undoubtedly enhance your Kubernetes journey. Arpit : Could you tell us a bit about yourself, your role, and how you got involved in SIG CLI? Maciej : I’m one of the technical leads for SIG-CLI. I was working on Kubernetes in multiple areas since 2014, and in 2018 I got appointed a lead. Katrina : I’ve been working with Kubernetes as an end-user since 2016, but it was only in late 2019 that I discovered how well SIG CLI aligned with my experience from internal projects. I started regularly attending meetings and made a few small PRs, and by 2021 I was working more deeply with the Kustomize team specifically. Later that year, I was appointed to my current roles as subproject owner for Kustomize and KRM Functions, and as SIG CLI Tech Lead and Chair. Arpit : Thank you! Could you share with us the purpose and goals of SIG CLI? Maciej : Our charter has the most detailed description, but in few words, we handle all CLI tooling that helps you manage your Kubernetes manifests and interact with your Kubernetes clusters. And how does SIG CLI work to promote best-practices for CLI development and usage in the cloud native ecosystem? Maciej : Within kubectl , we have several on-going efforts that try to encourage new contributors to align existing commands to new standards.</description></item><item><title>Blog: Improve your changelogs</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2023-05-24-blog-improve-your-changelogs/</link><pubDate>Wed, 24 May 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2023-05-24-blog-improve-your-changelogs/</guid><description>Improve your changelogs Background Overview of major improvements Example How to write commit messages Manually edit changelog Configuration Changelog for cluster repository Reuse pull requests Custom pipelines Jira as issue tracker More customizations References A standard part of the Jenkins X pipelines since a long time is the execution of jx changelog create that takes the commit messages between the release currently being created and the previous one and creates a change log from these. The change log is then stored as a release note in GitHub or other git provider. jx changelog create During the last year some improvements have landed in various Jenkins X components to improve the changelogs and their usefulness. So I’ll take this opportunity to describe these improvements and also in general give hints to how to get useful changelogs. Changelogs haven’t been very informative with regard to upgrades, ie those applied with jx promote or jx updatebot. One example of this is the release notes of jx after the split out of most functionality to plugins. Lately these have improved due to new functionality to propagate changelogs via pull requests. jx promote jx updatebot One place where changelogs have been completely lacking is in cluster repositories. But using the functionality for propagation of changelogs and some changes in jx boot job you can now a get a changelog for every successful application of changes in a cluster. An example of what this functionality achieves can be seen in a release of jx: https://github. com/jenkins-x/jx/releases/tag/v3.10.81 If you scroll past the boilerplate installation instructions you first see the changelog of jx itself generated from commit messages: https://github. com/jenkins-x/jx/compare/v3.10.80.</description></item><item><title>Blog: Spotlight on SIG Network</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2023-05-09-blog-spotlight-on-sig-network/</link><pubDate>Tue, 09 May 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2023-05-09-blog-spotlight-on-sig-network/</guid><description>Spotlight on SIG Network Networking is one of the core pillars of Kubernetes, and the Special Interest Group for Networking (SIG Network) is responsible for developing and maintaining the networking features of Kubernetes. It covers all aspects to ensure Kubernetes provides a reliable and scalable network infrastructure for containerized applications. In this SIG Network spotlight, Sujay Dey talked with Shane Utt , Software Engineer at Kong, chair of SIG Network and maintainer of Gateway API, on different aspects of the SIG, what are the exciting things going on and how anyone can get involved and contribute here. Sujay : Hello, and first of all, thanks for the opportunity of learning more about SIG Network. I would love to hear your story, so could you please tell us a bit about yourself, your role, and how you got involved in Kubernetes, especially in SIG Network? Shane : Hello! Thank you for reaching out. My Kubernetes journey started while I was working for a small data centre: we were early adopters of Kubernetes and focused on using Kubernetes to provide SaaS products. That experience led to my next position developing a distribution of Kubernetes with a focus on networking. During this period in my career, I was active in SIG Network (predominantly as a consumer). When I joined Kong my role in the community changed significantly, as Kong actively encourages upstream participation. I greatly increased my engagement and contributions to the Gateway API project during those years, and eventually became a maintainer. I care deeply about this community and the future of our technology, so when a chair position for the SIG became available, I volunteered my time immediately. I’ve enjoyed working on Kubernetes over the better part of a decade and I want to continue to do my part to ensure our community and technology continues to flourish.</description></item><item><title>Blog: E2E Testing Best Practices, Reloaded</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2023-04-12-blog-e2e-testing-best-practices-reloaded/</link><pubDate>Wed, 12 Apr 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2023-04-12-blog-e2e-testing-best-practices-reloaded/</guid><description>E2E Testing Best Practices, Reloaded Overall architecture Debuggability Recovering from test failures Interrupting tests Polling and timeouts Tips for writing and debugging long-running tests Next steps End-to-end (E2E) testing in Kubernetes is how the project validates functionality with real clusters. Contributors sooner or later encounter it when asked to write E2E tests for new features or to help with debugging test failures. Cluster admins or vendors might run the conformance tests, a subset of all tests in the E2E test suite. The underlying E2E framework for writing these E2E tests has been around for a long time. Functionality was added to it as needed, leading to code that became hard to maintain and use. The testing commons WG started cleaning it up, but dissolved before completely achieving their goals. After the migration to Gingko v2 in Kubernetes 1.25, I picked up several of the loose ends and started untangling them. This blog post is a summary of those changes. Some of this content is also found in the Kubernetes contributor document about writing good E2E tests and gets reproduced here to raise awareness that the document has been updated. At the moment, the framework is used in-tree for testing against a cluster ( test/e2e ), testing kubeadm ( test/e2e_kubeadm ) and kubelet ( test/e2e_node ). The goal is to make the core test/e2e/framework a package that has no dependencies on internal code and that can be used in different E2E suites without polluting them with features or options that make no sense for them. This is currently only a technical goal.</description></item><item><title>Blog: From Zero to Kubernets Subproject Lead</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2023-03-29-blog-from-zero-to-kubernets-subproject-lead/</link><pubDate>Wed, 29 Mar 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2023-03-29-blog-from-zero-to-kubernets-subproject-lead/</guid><description>From Zero to Kubernets Subproject Lead Starting up Always learning Why you - a beginner - are important to the project Getting started in any open-source community can be daunting, especially if it’s a big one like Kubernetes. I wrote this post to share my experience and encourage others to join up. All it takes is some curiosity and a willingness to show up! Here’s how my journey unfolded at a high level: What am I interested in? Is there a SIG (Special Interest Group) or a WG (Working Group) that is dedicated to that topic, or something similar? Sign up for their mailing list and start hopping on meetings. When (never if!) there are opportunities to help out and it aligns with your skills and desired growth areas, raise your hand. Ask for lots of help and don’t be shy about not knowing everything (or anything!) Keep plugging along, even if progress isn’t as fast as you would like it to be. First things first. What are you interested in learning more about? There are so many wonderful SIGs and working groups in the Kubernetes community: there’s something for everyone. And continuing to show up and participate will be so much easier if you think what you are doing is interesting. Likewise, continued participation is what keeps the community thriving, so that interest will drive you to have more of an impact. Also: it’s ok to show up knowing nothing! I remember showing up knowing very little about Kubernetes or how the community itself worked. And while I know more about how the community functions today, I am still learning all the time about it and the project. Fortunately, the community is full of friendly people who want to help you learn.</description></item><item><title>Blog: Reconcile with kpt live apply</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2023-03-09-blog-reconcile-with-kpt-live-apply/</link><pubDate>Thu, 09 Mar 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2023-03-09-blog-reconcile-with-kpt-live-apply/</guid><description>Reconcile with kpt live apply Configuration Waiting for resources to be reconciled Tagging and release notes kpt live apply Since the dawn of Jenkins X 3 the default last step of reconciling the state of the files in your cluster repository to your cluster has been to execute kubectl apply. You can find more details about this here. kubectl apply There are some drawbacks with kubectl apply though. The one that made me start looking for alternatives was that if you remove a resource from your cluster repository it may not be removed from your cluster. The way deletion works with kubectl apply is that it is handed the option &amp;ndash;prune which will remove resources that are not in the manifests. Except that it doesn’t always work as expected. It will only remove certain kinds of resources defined in kubectl. In my case I removed an HorizontalPodAutoscaler from my cluster repository, but it wasn’t removed from my cluster. kubectl apply kubectl apply &amp;ndash;prune When trying to find a solution to this I first tried to override this default list in kubectl of things to prune, but this turned out to be difficult in the general case. I also tried the already existing alternative of using kapp to apply the manifests, but I couldn’t get that to work. Looking for other options I settled for kpt live apply. kapp kpt live apply You enable the use of kpt live apply by adding kpt live apply KUBEAPPLY = kpt-apply KUBEAPPLY = kpt-apply to the Makefile of your cluster repository anywhere before include versionStream/src/Makefile.</description></item><item><title>Blog: Introducing KWOK: Kubernetes WithOut Kubelet</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2023-03-01-blog-introducing-kwok-kubernetes-without-kubelet/</link><pubDate>Wed, 01 Mar 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2023-03-01-blog-introducing-kwok-kubernetes-without-kubelet/</guid><description>Introducing KWOK: Kubernetes WithOut Kubelet What is KWOK? Why use KWOK? What are the use cases? What are the limitations? Getting started Getting Involved Author: Shiming Zhang (DaoCloud), Wei Huang (Apple), Yibo Zhuang (Apple) Have you ever wondered how to set up a cluster of thousands of nodes just in seconds, how to simulate real nodes with a low resource footprint, and how to test your Kubernetes controller at scale without spending much on infrastructure? If you answered “yes” to any of these questions, then you might be interested in KWOK, a toolkit that enables you to create a cluster of thousands of nodes in seconds. KWOK stands for Kubernetes WithOut Kubelet. So far, it provides two tools: kwok kwok kwokctl kwokctl kwok KWOK has several advantages: Speed : You can create and delete clusters and nodes almost instantly, without waiting for boot or provisioning. Compatibility : KWOK works with any tools or clients that are compliant with Kubernetes APIs, such as kubectl, helm, kui, etc. Portability : KWOK has no specific hardware or software requirements. You can run it using pre-built images, once Docker or Nerdctl is installed. Alternatively, binaries are also available for all platforms and can be easily installed.

In the passing year a couple of functionalities has been added to help with this. To avoid maintaining the OWNERS_ALIASES file in many repositories you can now refer to the OWNERS_ALIASES file in another repository. In the Jenkins X project we have the main OWNERS_ALIASES file in the jx-community repository. So in the jx repository the OWNERS_ALIASES file only looks like this: foreignAliases : - name : jx-community foreignAliases : - name : jx-community The organisation defaults to be the same as for the repository, but can specify as well. So in the jx-project repository the OWNERS_ALIASES file looks like this: foreignAliases : - name : jx-community org : jenkins-x foreignAliases : - name : jx-community org : jenkins-x Using the filed ref you can also specify a branch or tag to use instead of the default one of the repository. ref When creating or importing a repository using jx project the default content of OWNERS and OWNERS_ALIASES isn’t that useful since only the current user are put in the files. jx project If you create your own quickstarts you place the OWNERS and / or OWNERS_ALIASES files with the content of your liking in those. A recent new functionality is that you can put OWNERS and / or OWNERS_ALIASES files in the extensions directory of your cluster repository. These files will then be used as the default content of the files in new repositories. extensions ← Previous.</description></item><item><title>Blog: Project ideas for Google Summer of Code 2023 ☀️</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2023-02-06-blog-project-ideas-for-google-summer-of-code-2023/</link><pubDate>Mon, 06 Feb 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2023-02-06-blog-project-ideas-for-google-summer-of-code-2023/</guid><description>Project ideas for Google Summer of Code 2023 ☀️ 1.

In the context of Kubernetes, having best practices for cluster observability across all Kubernetes components is crucial. SIG Instrumentation helps to address this issue by providing best practices and tools that all other SIGs use to instrument Kubernetes components-like the API server , scheduler , kubelet and kube-controller-manager. In this SIG Instrumentation spotlight, Imran Noor Mohamed , SIG ContribEx-Comms tech lead talked with Elana Hashman , and Han Kang , chairs of SIG Instrumentation, on how the SIG is organized, what are the current challenges and how anyone can get involved and contribute. Imran (INM) : Hello, thank you for the opportunity of learning more about SIG Instrumentation. Could you tell us a bit about yourself, your role, and how you got involved in SIG Instrumentation? Han (HK) : I started in SIG Instrumentation in 2018, and became a chair in 2020. I primarily got involved with SIG instrumentation due to a number of upstream issues with metrics which ended up affecting GKE in bad ways. As a result, we ended up launching an initiative to stabilize our metrics and make metrics a proper API. Elana (EH) : I also joined SIG Instrumentation in 2018 and became a chair at the same time as Han. I was working as a site reliability engineer (SRE) on bare metal Kubernetes clusters and was working to build out our observability stack. I encountered some issues with label joins where Kubernetes metrics didn’t match kube-state-metrics ( KSM ) and started participating in SIG meetings to improve things. I helped test performance improvements to kube-state-metrics and ultimately coauthored a KEP for overhauling metrics in the 1.14 release to improve usability.</description></item><item><title>Blog: Prow and Tide for Kubernetes Contributors</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2022-12-12-blog-prow-and-tide-for-kubernetes-contributors/</link><pubDate>Mon, 12 Dec 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2022-12-12-blog-prow-and-tide-for-kubernetes-contributors/</guid><description>Prow and Tide for Kubernetes Contributors Why is this helpful Back to squashing Assignment, review, approval. More about Prow and Tide More advanced usage Authors: Chris Short , Frederico Muñoz In my work in the Kubernetes world, I look up a label or Prow command often. The systems behind the scenes ( Prow and Tide ) are here to help Kubernetes Contributors get stuff done. Labeling which SIG, WG, or subproject is as important as the issue or PR having someone assigned. To quote the docs , “Tide is a Prow component for managing a pool of GitHub PRs that match a given set of criteria. It will automatically retest PRs that meet the criteria (’tide comes in’) and automatically merge them when they have up-to-date passing test results (’tide goes out’). ” What actually prompted this article is the awesomely amazing folks on the Contributor Comms team saying, “I need to squash my commits and push that. ” Which immediately made me remember the wonder of the Tide label: tide/merge-method-squash. tide/merge-method-squash Contributing to Kubernetes will, most of the time, involve some kind of git-based action, specifically on the Kubernetes GitHub. This can be an obstacle to those less exposed to git and/or GitHub, and is especially noticeable when we’re dealing with non-code contributions (documentation, blog posts, etc. ). git When a contributor submits something, it will generally be through a pull request.</description></item><item><title>Blog: GSoC 2022 Final Report: Building Jenkins X UI</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2022-11-13-blog-gsoc-2022-final-report-building-jenkins-x-ui/</link><pubDate>Sun, 13 Nov 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2022-11-13-blog-gsoc-2022-final-report-building-jenkins-x-ui/</guid><description>GSoC 2022 Final Report: Building Jenkins X UI Jenkins X New UI Why need a new UI?

Acknowledgements It is a web application built with Golang for the backend and Sveltekit for the frontend, both of which are built together and used in the same container. To function properly, it must be installed as a helm chart with Jenkins X CRDs. 🌟 It has light and dark themes. A good UI is essential for a CI/CD tool, as not everyone is familiar with the CLI. The current UI (jx-pipeline-visualizer) is a read-only UI, the user can view the logs of PipelineActivity but neither can start nor stop the pipeline. Features that the UI will provide: Start and Stop a PipelineActivity. Have an audit trail. A graphical representation of PipelineActivity. RBAC to limit access to certain functionalities.

Acknowledgements Supply chain security is a rising concern in the current software era. Securing the software supply chain encompasses vulnerability remediation and the implementation of controls throughout the software development process. Due to massive increase in attacks on software supply chain and the diversity of its types , Jenkins X has to make efforts to ensure that the build process is secure. As part of securing Jenkins X installation by default I worked on both securing our own components and enabling our users to use these features in their build and release steps. The work done so far covers these four sections. Enhancing the jx version output jx version Integrating with Tekton Chains to sign TaskRuns and PipelineRuns Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) Signing Jenkins X artifacts jx version Description: A first step towards securing Jenkins X supply chain is to increase the amount of information gained from running jx version command. jx version Implementation The issue created for this task is here. The PR to fix it is here. Description: As Jenkins X uses tekton as its pipeline execution engine, TaskRun and PipelineRun are considered the key components of Jenkins X pipeline activities and steps Tekton Chains monitors the execution of all TaskRun and PipelineRun inside the cluster and takes a snapshot upon completion of each of them to sign with user-provided cryptographic keys and store them on the backend storage. The payload and signature cn be verified later using cosign verify-blob. TaskRun PipelineRun activities steps TaskRun PipelineRun cosign verify-blob Implementation I used the helm chart developed by Chainguard for integrating Chains with Jenkins X.

Author : Pushkar Joglekar (VMware) Accompanying the release of Kubernetes v1.25, we announced availability of an official CVE feed as an alpha feature. This blog will cover how we implemented this feature. alpha An auto-refreshing CVE feed allows users and implementers to programmatically fetch the list of CVEs announced by the Kubernetes SRC (Security Response Committee). To ensure freshness and minimal maintainer overhead, the feed updates automatically by fetching the CVE related information from the CVE announcement GitHub Issues. Creating these issues is already part of the existing Security Response Committee (SRC) workflow. Until December 2021, it was not possible to filter for issues or PRs that are tied to CVEs announced by Kubernetes SRC. We added a new label, official-cve-feed to address that, and SIG-Security labelled relevant issues with it. The in-scope issues are closed issues for which there is a CVE ID(s) and is officially announced as a Kubernetes security vulnerability by SRC. You can now filter on all of these issues and find them here. official-cve-feed closed For future security vulnerabilities, we added the label to the SRC playbook so that all the future in-scope issues will automatically have this label. For the next step, we created a prow job in order to periodically query the GitHub REST API and pull the relevant issues. The job runs every two hours and pushes the CVE related information fetched from GitHub into a Google Cloud Bucket.</description></item><item><title>Blog: Enhancements Opt-in Process Change for v1.26</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2022-09-09-blog-enhancements-opt-in-process-change-for-v1-26/</link><pubDate>Fri, 09 Sep 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2022-09-09-blog-enhancements-opt-in-process-change-for-v1-26/</guid><description>Enhancements Opt-in Process Change for v1.26 Context and Motivations How does the Github Project Board work? What does this mean for the community? Author: Grace Nguyen Since the inception of the Kubernetes release team, we have used a spreadsheet to keep track of enhancements for the release. The project has scaled massively in the past few years, with almost a hundred enhancements collected for the 1.24 release. This process has become error-prone and time consuming. A lot of manual work is required from the release team and the SIG leads to populate KEPs data in the sheet. We have received continuous feedback from our contributors to streamline the process. Starting with the 1.26 release, we are replacing the enhancements tracking spreadsheet with an automated GitHub project board. The board is populated with a script gathering all KEP issues in the kubernetes/enhancements repo that have the label lead-opted-in. The enhancements’ stage and SIG information will also be automatically pulled from the KEP issue. kubernetes/enhancements lead-opted-in After the KEP is populated on the Github Project Board, the Enhancements team will manually update the KEP with the label tracked/yes , tracked/no and on occasions, tracked/out-of-tree. The tracked label signifies qualification for the closest approaching milestone. For example, at the beginning of the release, tracked/yes means that the KEP has satisfied all Enhancements Freeze requirements and similarly for Code Freeze, tracked/yes means that all code related to the KEP has been merged. The tracked label is reserved for the Enhancements team use only.</description></item><item><title>Blog: Spotlight on SIG Storage</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2022-08-22-blog-spotlight-on-sig-storage/</link><pubDate>Mon, 22 Aug 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2022-08-22-blog-spotlight-on-sig-storage/</guid><description>Spotlight on SIG Storage About SIG Storage Storage and Kubernetes Ongoing challenges Community involvement Since the very beginning of Kubernetes, the topic of persistent data and how to address the requirement of stateful applications has been an important topic. Support for stateless deployments was natural, present from the start, and garnered attention, becoming very well-known. Work on better support for stateful applications was also present from early on, with each release increasing the scope of what could be run on Kubernetes. Message queues, databases, clustered filesystems: these are some examples of the solutions that have different storage requirements and that are, today, increasingly deployed in Kubernetes. Dealing with ephemeral and persistent storage, local or remote, file or block, from many different vendors, while considering how to provide the needed resiliency and data consistency that users expect, all of this is under SIG Storage’s umbrella. In this SIG Storage spotlight, Frederico Muñoz (Cloud &amp;amp; Architecture Lead at SAS) talked with Xing Yang , Tech Lead at VMware and co-chair of SIG Storage, on how the SIG is organized, what are the current challenges and how anyone can get involved and contribute. Frederico (FSM) : Hello, thank you for the opportunity of learning more about SIG Storage. Could you tell us a bit about yourself, your role, and how you got involved in SIG Storage. Xing Yang (XY) : I am a Tech Lead at VMware, working on Cloud Native Storage. I am also a Co-Chair of SIG Storage.

This post features four outstanding contributors from China, who have played diverse leadership and community roles in the upstream Kubernetes project. So, without further ado, let’s get straight to the article. Andy Zhang currently works for Microsoft China at the Shanghai site. His main focus is on Kubernetes storage drivers. Andy started contributing to Kubernetes about 5 years ago. He states that as he is working in Azure Kubernetes Service team and spends most of his time contributing to the Kubernetes community project. Now he is the main contributor of quite a lot Kubernetes subprojects such as Kubernetes cloud provider code. His open source contributions are mainly self-motivated. In the last two years he has mentored a few students contributing to Kubernetes through the LFX Mentorship program, some of whom got jobs due to their expertise and contributions on Kubernetes projects. Andy is an active member of the China Kubernetes community. He adds that the Kubernetes community has a good guide about how to become members, code reviewers, approvers and finally when he found out that some open source projects are in the very early stage, he actively contributed to those projects and became the project maintainer.</description></item><item><title>Blog: Enhancing Kubernetes one KEP at a Time</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2022-08-11-blog-enhancing-kubernetes-one-kep-at-a-time/</link><pubDate>Thu, 11 Aug 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2022-08-11-blog-enhancing-kubernetes-one-kep-at-a-time/</guid><description>Enhancing Kubernetes one KEP at a Time What’s the enhancements subteam? What does the enhancements subteam do? How can I get involved with the release team? How can I find out more? Author: Ryler Hockenbury (Mastercard) Did you know that Kubernetes v1.24 has 46 enhancements ? That’s a lot of new functionality packed into a 4-month release cycle. The Kubernetes release team coordinates the logistics of the release, from remediating test flakes to publishing updated docs. It’s a ton of work, but they always deliver. The release team comprises around 30 people across six subteams - Bug Triage, CI Signal, Enhancements, Release Notes, Communications, and Docs. Each of these subteams manages a component of the release. This post will focus on the role of the enhancements subteam and how you can get involved. Great question. We’ll get to that in a second but first, let’s talk about how features are managed in Kubernetes. Each new feature requires a Kubernetes Enhancement Proposal - KEP for short. KEPs are small structured design documents that provide a way to propose and coordinate new features. The KEP author describes the motivation, design (and alternatives), risks, and tests - then community members provide feedback to build consensus. KEPs are submitted and updated through a pull request (PR) workflow on the k/enhancements repo.</description></item><item><title>Blog: Spotlight on SIG Docs</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2022-08-02-blog-spotlight-on-sig-docs/</link><pubDate>Tue, 02 Aug 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2022-08-02-blog-spotlight-on-sig-docs/</guid><description>Spotlight on SIG Docs Introduction A summary of the conversation Could you tell us a little bit about what SIG Docs does? There are 2 subprojects under Docs: blogs and localization. How has the community benefited from it and are there some interesting contributions by those teams you want to highlight? Recently there has been a lot of buzz around the Kubernetes ecosystem as well as the industry regarding the removal of dockershim in the latest 1.24 release. How has SIG Docs helped the project to ensure a smooth change among the end-users? Why should new and existing contributors consider joining this SIG? How do you help new contributors get started? Are there any prerequisites to join? Any SIG related accomplishment that you’re really proud of? Is there something exciting coming up for the future of SIG Docs that you want the community to know? Wrap Up Author: Purneswar Prasad The official documentation is the go-to source for any open source project. For Kubernetes, it’s an ever-evolving Special Interest Group (SIG) with people constantly putting in their efforts to make details about the project easier to consume for new contributors and users. SIG Docs publishes the official documentation on kubernetes. io which includes, but is not limited to, documentation of the core APIs, core architectural details, and CLI tools shipped with the Kubernetes release. To learn more about the work of SIG Docs and its future ahead in shaping the community, I have summarised my conversation with the co-chairs, Divya Mohan (DM), Rey Lejano (RL) and Natali Vlatko (NV), who ran through the SIG’s goals and how fellow contributors can help. SIG Docs is the special interest group for documentation for the Kubernetes project on kubernetes. io, generating reference guides for the Kubernetes API, kubeadm and kubectl as well as maintaining the official website’s infrastructure and analytics. The remit of their work also extends to docs releases, translation of docs, improvement and adding new features to existing documentation, pushing and reviewing content for the official Kubernetes blog and engaging with the Release Team for each cycle to get docs and blogs reviewed. Blogs : This subproject highlights new or graduated Kubernetes enhancements, community reports, SIG updates or any relevant news to the Kubernetes community such as thought leadership, tutorials and project updates, such as the Dockershim removal and removal of PodSecurityPolicy, which is upcoming in the 1.25 release. Tim Bannister, one of the SIG Docs tech leads, does awesome work and is a major force when pushing contributions through to the docs and blogs.</description></item><item><title>Blog: Introduction to Software Bill Of Materials</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2022-07-24-blog-introduction-to-software-bill-of-materials/</link><pubDate>Sun, 24 Jul 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2022-07-24-blog-introduction-to-software-bill-of-materials/</guid><description>Introduction to Software Bill Of Materials Introduction Definition: What is SBOM? Use cases in Supply chain security Before going through Software Bill Of Materials (SBOMs), we need to set the ground for a rising concern in the software industry which is Software Supply Chain Security. Like traditional industries, deploying a piece of a software artifact goes through multiple stages composed of collecting source code components, libraries, tools, and processes used in those stages. Fig. 1 https://blog. convisoappsec. com/en/is-your-software-supply-chain-secure/ A supply chain attack can occur along the chain from submitting unauthorized malicious code in your source, unauthorized injection of harmful dependencies, and even replacing packages after being built with other compromised artifacts. A more detailed explanation about those types of attacks is here Due to its importance and being a critical issue, generating SBOM for your software adds another layer of protection to this threat. As far as we know, developers around the world are building web applications using hundreds of third-party open-source libraries and packages. You can confidently tell that 90% of the software products around the world are built over open-source components. With that in mind, we need to keep track of using these dependencies while building our applications. What if there are vulnerabilities in the libraries we use? How to efficiently protect ourselves against it?. Software Bill Of Materials (SBOM) is a complete formally structured list of the materials (components, packages, libraries, SDK) used to build (i.</description></item><item><title>Blog: Software Bill Of Materials Formats</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2022-07-24-blog-software-bill-of-materials-formats/</link><pubDate>Sun, 24 Jul 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2022-07-24-blog-software-bill-of-materials-formats/</guid><description>Software Bill Of Materials Formats Prerequisite Different SBOM formats comparison 1 - The Software Package Data Exchange (SPDX) 2 - Software Identification (SWID) Tags 3 - CycloneDX Generate SBOMs manually? definitely not If you don’t understand what is Software Bill of Materials (SBOM), please read this blog post first. The National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA) in the U. S. defined minimum requirements for SBOM formats : Identifying the supplier of the software component. Identifying the details about the version of the component. Including unique identifiers for the component like cryptographic hash functions. Including the relationships between all dependencies inside the component. Including a timestamp of when and by whom the SBOM report was created or last modified In this section, we discuss different kinds and formats for SBOM standards and make a brief comparison between them. Three commonly used standards achieved the NTIA minimum requirements for SBOM generation and each one results in a different final SBOM document. History: SPDX is an open-source machine-readable format adopted by the Linux Foundation as an industry standard. The specifications are implemented as a file format that identifies the software components within a larger piece of computer software and fulfilling the requirements of NTIA. The SPDX project started in 2010 and was initially dedicated to solving the issues around open source licensing compliance.</description></item><item><title>Blog: Software Bill Of Materials generation tools</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2022-07-24-blog-software-bill-of-materials-generation-tools/</link><pubDate>Sun, 24 Jul 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2022-07-24-blog-software-bill-of-materials-generation-tools/</guid><description>Software Bill Of Materials generation tools Prerequisite Different SBOM generation tools comparison 1 - Anchore Syft 2- Opensbom’s Spdx-Sbom-Generator 3- Kubernetes BOM 4- Microsoft SBOM tool 5- Tern Before you read this, you have to understand what are SBOMs and what are different formats of SBOMs If you got this far, you already realize the importance of SBOM generation, and also it should meet certain requirements to achieve its purpose. Due to various requirements depending on what standard you’re following, there has to be a way to automatically generate different output formats for different standards. Also, it has to be suited for ci/cd solutions to keep up with the increasing number of releases for each organization. Note: Here we’re only considering open source tools Introduction: Anchore is a platform that implements sbom-powered supply chain security solutions for developers and enterprises. For generating SBOMs, a CLI tool and library named Syft was developed by Anchore that could be injected into your ci/cd pipeline to generate SBOMs from container images and filesystems at each step. Integration and Support: Syft is supported on Linux, Mac, and Windows and it can run as a docker container which makes it a great suit for CI systems.

In 2022, I have been selected as a student developer in Google Summer of Code under Jenkins X. We will be building a new UI for Jenkins X. I got this news on May 20th, as I received an email from google. The technologies needed were Golang , Kubernetes , and GitOps. I used golang only once before, while linting Jenkins X codebase, I only used Kubernetes once before while setting up a k3s cluster to run Jenkins X pipelines. These tasks were necessary to do for all GSoC participants. Apart from that, I was a total beginner. So, when I got selected, I had a lot to learn, my mentors gave me a 30 Day plan. They also suggested some resources and conference talks which made it simple for me to start. 30 Day plan was: Learn golang Getting started with Kubernetes Learn what is a CRD and how they are used? Complete a tutorial on Kubebuilder Getting started with Tekton pipelines Learn Jenkins X We also had some amazing pair programming sessions, where I used to share my screen and my mentor guided me through, which is not common because mentors have a very busy schedule. But my mentors helped me a lot.</description></item><item><title>Blog: Contextual Logging in Kubernetes 1.24</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2022-05-25-blog-contextual-logging-in-kubernetes-1-24/</link><pubDate>Wed, 25 May 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2022-05-25-blog-contextual-logging-in-kubernetes-1-24/</guid><description>Contextual Logging in Kubernetes 1.24 Structured logging Contextual logging klog enhancements Contextual logging API ktesting logger klogr Reusable output test Output flushing Various other changes logcheck Next steps Authors: Patrick Ohly (Intel) The Structured Logging Working Group has added new capabilities to the logging infrastructure in Kubernetes 1.24. This blog post explains how developers can take advantage of those to make log output more useful and how they can get involved with improving Kubernetes. The goal of structured logging is to replace C-style formatting and the resulting opaque log strings with log entries that have a well-defined syntax for storing message and parameters separately, for example as a JSON struct. When using the traditional klog text output format for structured log calls, strings were originally printed with \n escape sequences, except when embedded inside a struct. For structs, log entries could still span multiple lines, with no clean way to split the log stream into individual entries: \n I1112 14:06:35.783529 328441 structured_logging. go:51] &amp;ldquo;using InfoS&amp;rdquo; longData={Name:long Data:Multiple lines with quite a bit of text. internal:0} I1112 14:06:35.783549 328441 structured_logging. go:52] &amp;ldquo;using InfoS with\nthe message across multiple lines&amp;rdquo; int=1 stringData=&amp;ldquo;long: Multiple\nlines\nwith quite a bit\nof text. &amp;quot; str=&amp;ldquo;another value&amp;rdquo; I1112 14:06:35.783529 328441 structured_logging. go:51] &amp;ldquo;using InfoS&amp;rdquo; longData={Name:long Data:Multiple lines with quite a bit of text. internal:0} I1112 14:06:35.783549 328441 structured_logging. go:52] &amp;ldquo;using InfoS with\nthe message across multiple lines&amp;rdquo; int=1 stringData=&amp;ldquo;long: Multiple\nlines\nwith quite a bit\nof text.</description></item><item><title>Blog: February 2022 Community Meeting Highlights</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2022-05-05-blog-february-2022-community-meeting-highlights/</link><pubDate>Thu, 05 May 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2022-05-05-blog-february-2022-community-meeting-highlights/</guid><description>February 2022 Community Meeting Highlights Author: Nigel Brown (VMware) We just had our first contributor community meeting this year, and it was awesome to be back with you in that format. These meetings will be happening on Zoom once per month, on the third Thursday of the month - that should be available in your calendar if you’re subscribed to the k-dev mailing list. Community meetings are an opportunity for you to meet synchronously with other members of the Kubernetes community to talk about issues of general appeal. This meeting kicked off with an update on the 1.24 release with Xander Grzywinski, who is one of the shadows for the release team leads. This release is scheduled for April 19, 2022 with a code freeze scheduled for March 30th. At the time of the meeting there were 66 individual enhancements included, as well as bug fixes. You can join the conversation on Slack in #sig-release. Update: Kubernetes 1.24 was delayed and released on May 3, 2022. From there, the discussion moved to the dockershim removal and the docs updates we need to make around that, with the discussion led by Kat Cosgrove. The main takeaway was that if you have a platform, talk to folks about this change. To most interacting with Kubernetes, it is probably not as impactful as it sounds. We have a helpful FAQ if you need.</description></item><item><title>Blog: Kubernetes 1.22 - Breaking change!</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2022-04-22-blog-kubernetes-1-22-breaking-change/</link><pubDate>Fri, 22 Apr 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2022-04-22-blog-kubernetes-1-22-breaking-change/</guid><description>Kubernetes 1.22 - Breaking change! To allow Jenkins X to support Kubernetes 1.22, we had to update our version of Tekton. This updated version of Tekton contains breaking changes that has consequences if you made your own custom Jenkins X pipelines. To make sure that your custom pipelines continue to work after this upgrade, you must edit the resource settings in your pipelines. Otherwise your pipelines will most likely not be able to start at all, or if they do, consume a lot of resources. Tekton made changes in how to calculate the resources needed to run a pipeline, in order to support the concept of LimitRange in Kubernetes (introduced in Kubernetes version 1.10). Previously, Tekton simply used the maximum requested cpu and memory of any single step, and set that as limits for the all steps in the pipeline. For more details, please read the Tekton documentation on LimitRange. In the Tekton pipeline files, the StepTemplate needs to be changed to not specify resource requests , but only setting an empty resource limits : requests limits stepTemplate : image : uses:jenkins-x/jx3-pipeline-catalog/tasks/go/release. yaml@a5ab19ebc5a074e0402c5016b11bc11b32cc5c83 name : &amp;quot;&amp;quot; resources : # override limits for all containers here limits : {} stepTemplate : image : uses:jenkins-x/jx3-pipeline-catalog/tasks/go/release. yaml@a5ab19ebc5a074e0402c5016b11bc11b32cc5c83 name : &amp;quot;&amp;quot; resources : # override limits for all containers here limits : {} The resource requests should be set on only one individual step: requests steps : - image : uses:Mentor-Medier/jx3-pipeline-catalog/tasks/git-clone/git-clone-pr. yaml@versionStream name : &amp;quot;&amp;quot; resources : {} - name : jx-variables resources : requests : cpu : 400m memory : 512Mi steps : - image : uses:Mentor-Medier/jx3-pipeline-catalog/tasks/git-clone/git-clone-pr. yaml@versionStream name : &amp;quot;&amp;quot; resources : {} - name : jx-variables resources : requests : cpu : 400m memory : 512Mi To see examples of what changes you need to apply to your custom pipelines you may investigate this PR on The Jenkins X pipeline catalog.</description></item><item><title>Blog: Google Summer of Code 2022 project proposal template ☀️</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2022-04-05-blog-google-summer-of-code-2022-project-proposal-template/</link><pubDate>Tue, 05 Apr 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2022-04-05-blog-google-summer-of-code-2022-project-proposal-template/</guid><description>Google Summer of Code 2022 project proposal template ☀️ Proposal template Full name: Country: Time zone: Email: Github ID: Personal blog (optional): Twitter/LinkedIn/others: Have you participated in the Google Summer of Code previously?

Potential Workaround Possible solutions to counter the above errors The current situation Solutions Implementing the Short Term Workaround Conclusion Authors: Subhasmita Swain , Davanum Srinivas If you are contributing to the Kubernetes project and are developing on a Windows PC, it is conceivable that you will encounter certain issues that will cause your pull request to get held up by test failures. This article describes a workaround for a similar issue I encountered when attempting to have my modifications approved and merged into the master branch. While contributing to kubernetes/kubernetes for some minor documentation changes, the pushed changes needed to be updated with other verified contents of the entire documentation. So, in order for the change to take effect, a single command must be performed to ensure that all tests on the CI pipeline pass. The single command make update runs all presubmission verification tests. For some reason on the “Windows Subsystem for Linux” environment the tests, specifically the update-openapi-spec. sh script, failed (in my case, take a look at the conversation here ), eventually failing the pull-kubernetes-verify tests. make update pull-kubernetes-verify You might encounter the following on your PR The tests failing the particular issue: Consecutively, Additionally one can check the failed test via the link provided under details in the above image. link Run the failing. sh scripts individually known from the CI job output, to generate the expected files to fix up the failures.

This post will feature four outstanding contributors from the Australia and New Zealand regions, who have played diverse leadership and community roles in the Upstream Kubernetes project. So, without further ado, let’s get straight to the article. Caleb Woodbine is currently a member of the ii. nz organisation. He began contributing to the Kubernetes project in 2018 as a member of the Kubernetes Conformance working group. His experience was positive, and he benefited from early guidance from Hippie Hacker , a fellow contributor from New Zealand. He has made major contributions to Kubernetes project since then through SIG k8s-infra and k8s-conformance working group. SIG k8s-infra k8s-conformance Caleb is also a co-organizer of the CloudNative NZ community events, which aim to expand the reach of Kubernetes project throughout New Zealand in order to encourage technical education and improved employment opportunities. There need to be more outreach in APAC and the educators and universities must pick up Kubernetes, as they are very slow and about 8+ years out of date. NZ tends to rather pay overseas than educate locals on the latest cloud tech Locally.

Multi-tenancy in Jenkins X Next Steps We have put together some project ideas as part of our application to participate in the Google Summer of Code 2022 program. The only way to trigger jobs/workflows in Jenkins X at the moment is by listening to events from Source Control Management (SCM) providers like github, gitlab, bitbucket, however it would be nice to listen to other event sources and trigger jobs/pipelines in Jenkins X. One interesting application would be to trigger some Jenkins X job in response to some alerting event (pagerduty, opsgenie). As a start we should focus on (emitting and listening to) cloudevents which define a common format for events produced from different sources. This will also help make Jenkins X compatible with other platforms. Jenkins X should be able to emit cloud events Jenkins X should be able to listen to cloud events, and run pipelines Updated documentation Golang, kubernetes, cloudevents, familiarity with lighthouse would be great, but not required Ankit D Mohapatra Christopher Vig Tom Hobson https://cloudevents.</description></item><item><title>Blog: SIG Node CI Subproject Celebrates Two Years of Test Improvements</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2022-02-16-blog-sig-node-ci-subproject-celebrates-two-years-of-test-improvements/</link><pubDate>Wed, 16 Feb 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2022-02-16-blog-sig-node-ci-subproject-celebrates-two-years-of-test-improvements/</guid><description>SIG Node CI Subproject Celebrates Two Years of Test Improvements Timeline Statistics Future Authors: Sergey Kanzhelev (Google), Elana Hashman (Red Hat) Ensuring the reliability of SIG Node upstream code is a continuous effort that takes a lot of behind-the-scenes effort from many contributors. There are frequent releases of Kubernetes, base operating systems, container runtimes, and test infrastructure that result in a complex matrix that requires attention and steady investment to “keep the lights on. ” In May 2020, the Kubernetes node special interest group (“SIG Node”) organized a new subproject for continuous integration (CI) for node-related code and tests. Since its inauguration, the SIG Node CI subproject has run a weekly meeting, and even the full hour is often not enough to complete triage of all bugs, test-related PRs and issues, and discuss all related ongoing work within the subgroup. Over the past two years, we’ve fixed merge-blocking and release-blocking tests, reducing time to merge Kubernetes contributors’ pull requests thanks to reduced test flakes. When we started, Node test jobs only passed 42% of the time, and through our efforts, we now ensure a consistent &amp;gt;90% job pass rate. We’ve closed 144 test failure issues and merged 176 pull requests just in kubernetes/kubernetes. And we’ve helped subproject participants ascend the Kubernetes contributor ladder, with 3 new org members, 6 new reviewers, and 2 new approvers. The Node CI subproject is an approachable first stop to help new contributors get started with SIG Node. There is a low barrier to entry for new contributors to address high-impact bugs and test fixes, although there is a long road before contributors can climb the entire contributor ladder: it took over a year to establish two new approvers for the group. The complexity of all the different components that power Kubernetes nodes and its test infrastructure requires a sustained investment over a long period for developers to deeply understand the entire system, both at high and low levels of detail. We have several regular contributors at our meetings, however; our reviewers and approvers pool is still small.</description></item><item><title>Blog: Jenkins X Survey Result Details</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2022-02-15-blog-jenkins-x-survey-result-details/</link><pubDate>Tue, 15 Feb 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2022-02-15-blog-jenkins-x-survey-result-details/</guid><description>Jenkins X Survey Result Details What do you enjoy the most with Jenkins X?

She finds it somewhat difficult to find documentation, average 2.9 out of 5 The Jenkins X user tries to find information mainly on the main web site, sometimes on slack and less often on github. What he enjoys most about Jenkins X is that it is an easy way to learn, play around and work with Kubernetes. The git(ops(ish)) style of configuration, the preview environments, and the staging /production environments. But one thing is sure, documentation is confusing and shold be improved. The typical Jenkins X user would like to run Jenkins X offline, either to run on a laptop, or behind a (corporate) firewall. Proper support for multi-tenancy would be nice, and who can ignore security in these times. A clear governance of Jenkins X needs to be established, The typical person who answers surveys on Jenkins X is planning to attend Jenkins X Office hours, which is great!

Historically, Kubernetes resources only interacted within that boundary - KRU or Kubernetes Resource Universe (not an actual Kubernetes concept). Kubernetes clusters, even now, don’t really know anything about themselves or, about other clusters. Absence of cluster identifiers is a case in point. With the growing adoption of multicloud and multicluster deployments, the work SIG Multicluster doing is gaining a lot of attention. In this article, Jeremy Olmsted-Thompson, Google and Chris Short, AWS discuss the interesting problems SIG Multicluster is solving and how you can get involved. Their initials JOT and CS will be used for brevity. CS : How long has the SIG Multicluster existed and how was the SIG in its infancy? How long have you been with this SIG? JOT : I’ve been around for almost two years in the SIG Multicluster. All I know about the infancy years is from the lore but even in the early days, it was always about solving this same problem. Early efforts have been things like KubeFed. I think there are still folks using KubeFed but it’s a smaller slice.

In this post, we’ll introduce you to five amazing folks from the India region who have been actively contributing to the upstream Kubernetes projects in a variety of ways, as well as being the leaders or maintainers of numerous community initiatives. 💫 Let’s get started, so without further ado… Arsh is currently employed with Okteto as a Developer Experience engineer. As a new contributor, he realised that 1:1 mentorship opportunities were quite beneficial in getting him started with the upstream project. He is presently a CI Signal shadow on the Kubernetes 1.23 release team. He is also contributing to the SIG Testing and SIG Docs projects, as well as to the cert-manager tools development work that is being done under the aegis of SIG Architecture. To the newcomers, Arsh helps plan their early contributions sustainably. I would encourage folks to contribute in a way that’s sustainable. What I mean by that is that it’s easy to be very enthusiastic early on and take up more stuff than one can actually handle. This can often lead to burnout in later stages. It’s much more sustainable to work on things iteratively. Kunal Kushwaha is a core member of the Kubernetes marketing council.</description></item><item><title>Blog: Incident: Kaniko and ACR</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2021-12-28-blog-incident-kaniko-and-acr/</link><pubDate>Tue, 28 Dec 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2021-12-28-blog-incident-kaniko-and-acr/</guid><description>Incident: Kaniko and ACR So what happened?

What is changing? v2 users v3 users When will all this take place? Why are only the most recent versions v2 images copied to GitHub packages and not all versions? I’m on v2 and use a builder image which is not available on GitHub container registry, how do I build my own version to work with the new helm and image repositories? I’m getting a missing arg &amp;ndash;provider-values-dir and helm repository https://jenkins-x-charts. github. io/v2 does not have an associated prefix in in the ‘charts/repositories. yml’ error TL;DR - Jenkins X specific helm repositories and container registries hosted on GCP have been moved to GitHub. This will mainly affect jx v2 users but there is expected to be a small impact on v3 users too. Below describes the steps we believe are needed to keep Jenkins X installations working as normal but there will be some action needed. When Jenkins X first started we made heavy use of GCP’s services for hosting the cloud infrastructure needed by users to install and run Jenkins X. This was great as we could use the same IAM to push and maintain content from our own hosted build infrastructure and ensure we were validating the same experience of using cloud provider hosted services wherever possible. As Jenkins X grew in popularity the cloud costs began to increase with the pricing model from GCP , specifically the networking costs of cross continent egress. Given this, for jx3 we decided to see if switching to GitHub packages for container images and GitHub pages for helm repositories would be better, the result was it is better. In fact we have made it super easy for users to switch to using GitHub pages for releasing helm charts and using GitHub packages. Now that we have validated GitHub is more cost effective for hosting public images and helm charts for the Jenkins X project, we want to switch to using GitHub for all v2 plus v3 users, then shutdown the GCP services which are causing unnecessary cost.</description></item><item><title>Blog: How to debug your Tekton pipelines</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2021-08-18-blog-how-to-debug-your-tekton-pipelines/</link><pubDate>Wed, 18 Aug 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2021-08-18-blog-how-to-debug-your-tekton-pipelines/</guid><description>How to debug your Tekton pipelines How to debug Tekton Pipelines Prerequisites Enable a breakpoint Viewing breakpoints Using a breakpoint Opening a shell Continuing after the breakpoint Removing breakpoints Conclusion Tekton recently introduced a debug feature when you create TaskRun resources so that steps can be paused at a breakpoint until told to move forwards so that you can diagnose why pipeline steps fail. TaskRun The latest Tekton release only supports breakpoints on TaskRun resources but there is a Pull Request #4145 to add support also to debugging PipelineRun resources as well. If you are reading this please add your thumbs up emoji feedback to the PR #4145 TaskRun PipelineRun We’ve switched Jenkins X to use a preview image of Tekton with PR #4145 included so that Jenkins X developers can easily debug their pipelines (which typically are PipelineRun resources). PipelineRun Here is a demo which shows how to debug pipelines: Make sure your cluster is upgraded to the latest version stream. If you intend to use the jx in the below examples make sure you upgrade the CLI too jx To enable a breakpoint you can: use the Lens UI as shown in the above video by: right click on a Pipeline action menu select Breakpoint -&amp;gt; Add right click on a Pipeline action menu Pipeline select Breakpoint -&amp;gt; Add Breakpoint -&amp;gt; Add you can use the jx pipeline debug command then select the pipeline to add/remove a breakpoint. You can view breakpoints in the Lens UI in the Breakpoints tab or via: Breakpoints kubectl get lighthousebreakpoints # you can use the short name: kubectl get lhbp kubectl get lighthousebreakpoints # you can use the short name: kubectl get lhbp Once you have set a breakpoint defined for a particular Pipeline you need to trigger the pipeline. e. g. perform a git commit on the git branch to trigger a new pipeline to execute. The pipeline will execute as normal; you’ll be able to view it execute via: Lens UI run jx pipeline grid to watch pipelines run and select the one you wish to view the log run jx pipeline log to watch the log of a specific pipeline Once your breakpoint is reached the pipeline pod will pause, waiting to continue. At this point you can then open a shell inside the container. The easiest way to do this is via the Lens UI , click on the Pipeline action menu then Shell -&amp;gt; latest step and a shell will open.</description></item><item><title>Blog: How to use GitOps and Kubernetes External Secrets for better audit and security</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2021-08-17-blog-how-to-use-gitops-and-kubernetes-external-secrets-for-better-audit-and-secu/</link><pubDate>Tue, 17 Aug 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2021-08-17-blog-how-to-use-gitops-and-kubernetes-external-secrets-for-better-audit-and-secu/</guid><description>How to use GitOps and Kubernetes External Secrets for better audit and security Standardising GitOps layouts Why Jenkins X uses helmfile template Why we use Kubernetes External Secrets How to use this approach to GitOps and Secrets if not using Jenkins X Summary So GitOps is a cool approach to managing kubernetes resources in a cluster, by checking in the source code for: the kubernetes YAMLs details of the helm charts you want to install along with any configuration kustomize scripts. Then everything is versioned and audited; you know who changed what, when and why. If a change breaks things, just revert via git like any other source code change. You can then add pipelines to verify changes in the Pull Requests result in valid kubernetes YAML etc. Then if you merge changes to git then an operator detect the change and do the kubectl apply (or helm install or whatever). kubectl apply helm install There are a number of tools out there for doing this. e. g. Anthos Config Management , argo cd , fleet , flux cd and kapp controller So why did Jenkins X not use these tools and instead created its own git operator ? Over time it would be great to have more standardisation of the Git layout given the different tool. Our current recommended layout that works with many GitOps tools is described here. A number of solutions in the GitOps space define which helm charts to install in git with configuration files; or specify which kustomize templates to apply etc. However Jenkins X defaults to using helmfile to manage installing, upgrading and configuring multiple helm charts.</description></item><item><title>Blog: How to choose a SIG as a non-code Kubernetes contributor</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2021-07-09-blog-how-to-choose-a-sig-as-a-non-code-kubernetes-contributor/</link><pubDate>Fri, 09 Jul 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2021-07-09-blog-how-to-choose-a-sig-as-a-non-code-kubernetes-contributor/</guid><description>How to choose a SIG as a non-code Kubernetes contributor How I found my SIG How I contribute Hop into the Kubernetes community By Chris Short Kubernetes contributors aren’t people in capes or part of some secret society. How to start committing to the GitHub repos that make up the project is well documented , yet it remains intimidating for many. A few years ago, I spoke at an event and jokingly said, “Kubernetes is just a bunch of APIs and YAML… I’m a contributor; you don’t believe me?” After that talk, someone pulled me aside and asked if I was the Kubernetes contributor. They wanted to get involved in the community. Then came the real question, “I don’t know which special interest group (SIG) I would work in. ” The SIG you work in depends on your skills and what you want to do with your (or your company’s) free time. I’ll start with myself as an example. I do not code as part of my day-to-day work; I never have. While I have made bits of code into programs here and there, I always had a helping hand. It’s also possible my definition of a coder is busted too. But, I consider myself a non-code contributor to Kubernetes. I’m an Ops person that embraced DevOps early.</description></item><item><title>Blog: Jenkins X 3 and Argo CD</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2021-06-28-blog-jenkins-x-3-and-argo-cd/</link><pubDate>Mon, 28 Jun 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2021-06-28-blog-jenkins-x-3-and-argo-cd/</guid><description>Jenkins X 3 and Argo CD Install Argo CD with Jenkins X Conclusion There have been a number of requests from the Jenkins X community to use Argo CD for the last mile deployment phase of their continuous delivery pipelines. This blog explains some of the advantages of using Jenkins X and Argo CD all together. What’s included? Jenkins X for Cloud Infrastructure using Terraform, core installation management with GitOps, external secret management, ingress controller, quickstarts, automated CI + CD pipelines, ChatOps Tekton for pipeline orchestration Argo CD for end users application deployments (not the main installation) Argo CD provides a declarative GitOps approach to deploying Kubernetes based applications. There is a GUI which helps construct the deployment definition (in the form of an Application custom resource) which offers a number of configuration options, as well and providing insight into your clusters applications. Application You might be wondering why you would want to use BOTH Jenkins X and Argo CD together. Jenkins X aims to embrace OSS, where possible providing a nice UX to integrate with other projects and help provide better solutions for building, developing and running software on Kubernetes. Jenkins X indeed does have a git operator that applies Kubernetes YAML from a Git repository but there are some differences: Jenkins X uses GitOps principles for the entire installation, i. e. the starting point is a Git repository which is used to provision a cluster and manage (automatic if users wish) upgrades whereas today Argo CD uses a manual kubectl apply to manage the Argo installation itself.

To make things a little easier to get started we’ve created a new node-postgresql quickstart. If you are using the cloud then we prefer cloud over kubernetes for things like databases, storage, ingress and secret managers so please try use your clouds managed databases if you can. So ideally you’d set up your database via your infrastructure as code solution, such as terraform , and then associate your kubernetes Service Account to a cloud IAM role to access the database. However to provide something simple that just works in any kubernetes cluster this quickstart uses the postgres-operator to manage setting up each database cluster in each environment. So to be able to use this quickstart you will need to install this operator into your cluster. You can add charts to your cluster via the CLI. From inside a git clone of your cluster git repository run the following command: jx gitops helmfile add &amp;ndash;chart commonground/postgres-operator &amp;ndash;repository https://charts. commonground. nl/ &amp;ndash;namespace postgres &amp;ndash;version 1.6.2 jx gitops helmfile add &amp;ndash;chart commonground/postgres-operator &amp;ndash;repository https://charts. commonground. nl/ &amp;ndash;namespace postgres &amp;ndash;version 1.6.2 This will modify the helmfile.</description></item><item><title>Blog: Jenkins X at cdCon</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2021-06-22-blog-jenkins-x-at-cdcon/</link><pubDate>Tue, 22 Jun 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2021-06-22-blog-jenkins-x-at-cdcon/</guid><description>Jenkins X at cdCon Tuesday, June 22 GitOps Summit Wednesday, June 23 Thursday, June 24 cdCon 2021 is about to start with lots of great sessions.

How to get kubernetes? How do I connect to kubernetes? How do I replace docker with kubernetes? docker run =&amp;gt; kubectl run docker build =&amp;gt; kubectl build compose =&amp;gt; helm testcontainers =&amp;gt; sidecars / kubedock help! we are not even using kubernetes yet other handy kubectl commands inner loop Conclusion Are you developing software that’s intended to run on kubernetes? If so we recommend not to use docker on your laptop. Docker on Windows/MacOS helps you run a VM that can then run linux containers easily. But why bother? We highly recommend just use a development kubernetes cluster - build and run your containers there instead then you’re closer to a production like environment. why test on a completely different VM and container orchestrator than production? It’s better to test on a similar environment to where you are really going to deploy your code test your kubernetes yaml / helm chart and associated configuration at the same time as you run your containers helps you catch mistakes earlier: it’s not just about running the container image; it’s about lots of other things too like networking, configuration, secrets, storage/volumes, cloud infrastructure, service mesh, liveness/readiness/startup probes - so why not test all of those things rather than just the image? it’s not just about running the container image; it’s about lots of other things too like networking, configuration, secrets, storage/volumes, cloud infrastructure, service mesh, liveness/readiness/startup probes - so why not test all of those things rather than just the image? some corporate environments don’t let you run VMs on your laptop anyway so running docker locally isn’t an option First you’ll need a kubernetes cluster. I fully agree with James Ward that developers should not need to run kubernetes. Friends don’t let friends setup and manage kubernetes clusters by hand :). So try ask your infrastructure team for a development cluster or, if you can, use the cloud to set-up a managed kubernetes cluster. All the public clouds have a relatively straightforward way to spin up a fully managed kubernetes cluster for you that will be relatively inexpensive &amp;amp; they are easy to scale down when you don’t need them. e. g. on Google Cloud it’s a couple of clicks and about 5 minutes later you’ll have a fully managed kubernetes cluster ready to use. Its easy to enable auto-scaling too.</description></item><item><title>Blog: Jenkins X 3 - May 2021 LTS</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2021-05-12-blog-jenkins-x-3-may-2021-lts/</link><pubDate>Wed, 12 May 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2021-05-12-blog-jenkins-x-3-may-2021-lts/</guid><description>Jenkins X 3 - May 2021 LTS May 2001 LTS release is now available!

Demo Documentation Changes since the 3. x beta User Changes since 2. x Platform Changes Getting started Final thoughts I’m super excited to announce the 3.0 GA (General Availability) release of Jenkins X! Jenkins X automates your CI/CD on kubernetes to help you accelerate : Automated CI/CD pipelines lets you focus on your actually application code while Jenkins X automatically creates battle tested Tekton CI/CD pipelines for your project which are managed via GitOps so that its super easy to keep your pipelines up to date across your repositories or to upgrade or override pipelines or steps for specific repositories. Automatic promotion of versioned artifacts via GitOps through your Environments such as Staging , Pre-production and Production whether they are running in the same kubernetes cluster or you are using multiple clusters for your environments Staging Pre-production Production Preview Environments lets you propose code changes via Pull Requests and have a Preview Environment automatically created, running your code in kubernetes to get fast feedback from your team before agreeing to merge changes to the main branch ChatOps comment on Pull Requests to give feedback, approve/hold changes, trigger optional pipelines for additional testing and other ChatOps commands Here’s a demo of how to develop code with Jenkins X the main documentation of the changes are: the new architecture with modular plugins and improved extension points what has changed since 3. x started how 3. x compares to 2. x DevOps Guides and DevOps Patterns provides an overview of our learnings in the DevOps space here’s a brief summary of the differences: The following improvements have been made since the first beta : Integrated observability and monitoring with Pipeline Tracing Auto scale preview environments with Osiris Enable auto upgrade to keep your cluster up to date As a user the high level UX of Jenkins X is similar: automated Continuous Delivery pipelines for using tekton for your repositories with automatic promotion between your environments pull requests on your repositories create separate Preview Environments where your team can review your changes and give fast feedback before your changes are approved and merged into the main trunk. we now default to vanilla tekton YAML for defining pipelines while accelerating your tekton with tekton catalog we include an open source dashboard for visualising pipelines and logs which you can invoke via: jx dash jx dash we now use helm (3. x) and helmfile along with optionally kustomize in a GitOps style to define and configure both Jenkins X itself, your tools and applications in any namespace support multi cluster out of the box so you can keep Staging and Production in separate clusters to your development cluster where your pipelines run, you create and release immutable container images and other artifacts.

Initially when we decided to maintain an LTS version stream we thought we’d aim for monthly releases however this second release comes two months after the first. This has given us more chances to run fixes and chart upgrades on Jenkins X own infrastructure to verify stability. Note This LTS release is intended to be the final one before Jenkins X 3 is made Generally Available so stay tuned for the exciting news coming very soon! We will of course continue to develop and release LTS post GA.

What’s next? Now that Jenkins X has solid integration with Grafana for its observability , it’s time to start building fun things! And the first one is tracing for all your pipelines : With it, you can easily see the timings of all your pipelines, stages, and steps. This is great to inspect a “slow” pipeline and quickly see the slower steps. We are using OpenTelemetry to generate a “logical” view of the pipeline, with 1 trace per pipeline and 1 span for each stage and step. By default, these traces are ingested by Grafana Tempo. But if you prefer to export them to a different destination, it’s very easy, and thanks to the OpenTelemetry Collector you can export to a lot of different services. You can see the full list here and here. The trace identifier is also stored in the pipeline itself so that the Jenkins X Pipelines Visualizer UI can link directly to the trace. You just need to enable the observability stack, as explained in the observability admin guide. Then, trigger a pipeline, and once it’s finished, go to the web UI, and click on the “Trace” button on the top-right. That’s it! This is only the first step of native tracing support in Jenkins X. Stay tuned for more! ← Previous.</description></item><item><title>Blog: Jenkins X v3: now with built-in observability</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2021-04-01-blog-jenkins-x-v3-now-with-built-in-observability/</link><pubDate>Thu, 01 Apr 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2021-04-01-blog-jenkins-x-v3-now-with-built-in-observability/</guid><description>Jenkins X v3: now with built-in observability Platform Observability Continuous Delivery Indicators Roadmap As a Continuous Delivery platform, Jenkins X has a central part in your infrastructure. If it becomes unstable or unusable, it will impact the whole software delivery of your organization. This is why observability is a critical topic for Jenkins X, and work has started to get observability built-in for Jenkins X v3: Platform Observability : visualize logs and metrics for everything running in the Kubernetes cluster: Jenkins X’s own components - Tekton, Lighthouse, cert-manager, … - but also your own applications, that will be deployed either in preview environments or in the staging/prod environments. Continuous Delivery Indicators : visualize pull requests, pipelines, releases, and deployments metrics, collected from cluster events and git events. We’re using Grafana as the central visualization component: the main entry point from which you can get a complete overview of both your application’s lifecycle - development, build, tests, releases, deployments, runtime - and your Continuous Delivery platform. Platform observability is not enabled by default for the moment, so the first step is to enable it, as explained in the platform observability admin guide. Once it’s done, you’ll get a running Grafana instance, pre-configured with data sources for applications logs - using Loki - and applications metrics - using Prometheus. But most important, it comes with a set of pre-defined Grafana dashboards for the main platform components: Tekton, Lighthouse, cert-manager, … Here is an example of such a dashboard, using a mix of data sources to display cert-manager metrics collected by Prometheus - including the certificates expiration dates - and logs collected by Loki/Promtail: Continuous Delivery Indicators’ main goal is to give people insights into their workflows/processes so that they can continuously improve them. This is based on the DORA devops metrics and the SPACE framework. The CD Indicators addon is not enabled by default for the moment, so the first step is to enable it, as explained in the continuous delivery indicators admin guide. Once it’s done, you’ll get a running collector, along with a PostgreSQL database. The collector will listen for various events, both from the cluster and the git repositories, and store pull requests, pipelines, releases, and deployments data in the PostgreSQL database.</description></item><item><title>Blog: Scaling Preview Environments with Osiris</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2021-04-01-blog-scaling-preview-environments-with-osiris/</link><pubDate>Thu, 01 Apr 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2021-04-01-blog-scaling-preview-environments-with-osiris/</guid><description>Scaling Preview Environments with Osiris Osiris How can you benefit from it in your own Jenkins X cluster? How does it work? One of Jenkins X’s core features is the preview environments : temporary environments created automatically for each Pull Requests, to deploy your application and its dependencies. You can then use this preview environment to run integration tests, or manually use/test your application. This is all great until you have more and more applications, each with a few dependencies (postgresql, mongodb, …) and a few opened pull requests at any time. This means that you’ll get more and more pods running in your Kubernetes cluster, in addition to Jenkins X’s own components, your build pipelines, and of course your staging and production applications - unless you are using multi-cluster. The result is that you’ll need more nodes or bigger nodes. Which means more money. But, these preview environments are in fact idle most of the time: they are only used for the integration tests, and sometimes when someone manually uses them. The rest of the time - including all night for example - they are just staying there, idle, and consuming resources. What if we could easily scale them down when they are idle, and automatically bring them up when we need them? So that a Pull Request staying opened for 2 weeks because someone went on vacation won’t consume resources in your cluster. Enter Osiris ! Initially created by the Deislabs team , Osiris is a Kubernetes component that will automatically scale down your “idle” pods, and scale them up when a request comes in. Although the original project has been archived, the Dailymotion team has taken over the maintenance of a fork. And they have been using it with success in their Jenkins X dev cluster for more than 2 years: they regularly have around 50 preview environments active at any time, and… 0 pods from these environments running at night - or on weekends.</description></item><item><title>Blog: cdCon 2021 - Call for Jenkins X Proposals</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2021-02-25-blog-cdcon-2021-call-for-jenkins-x-proposals/</link><pubDate>Thu, 25 Feb 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2021-02-25-blog-cdcon-2021-call-for-jenkins-x-proposals/</guid><description>cdCon 2021 - Call for Jenkins X Proposals Topics Hear ye!

We are moving towards a microservice kind of world with many teams writing many bits of software in many repositories. So there are lots and lots of pipelines. These pipelines keep getting more sophisticated over time; doing much more (all kinds of building, analysis, reporting, testing, ChatOps etc) and the software/images/approaches they use change. So how can we manage, configure and maintain them all so that there are many pipelines for many repositories; where each repository can customise anything it needs but we can easily maintain everything continuously and its easy to understand and tool around? We’ve tried to tackle this problem in a number of ways over the years; each has pros and cons. One option is to put all your pipelines in a shared library. You can then reference the pipelines by name in each of your repositories. But what if you want to change a bit of a pipeline for a specific repository? If you change it globally for everyone you can break things. You may just want local customisation for your repository only. You can add parameters into your pipelines. They are quite verbose on Pipelines and PipelineRuns ; but it’s hard to think up front of every parameterisation that may be required by downstream repositories. e.</description></item><item><title>Blog: Jenkins X 3 - February 2021 LTS</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2021-02-01-blog-jenkins-x-3-february-2021-lts/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Feb 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2021-02-01-blog-jenkins-x-3-february-2021-lts/</guid><description>Jenkins X 3 - February 2021 LTS What’s the difference?

To kick this off we are going to start with 9 videos that we’ll follow up with more dedicated blogs over the coming weeks. The complete playlist can be found here however the blog below gives a more context for each one. There are a few key areas we are focusing on here: Starting off with a very quick introduction including what to expect from the walkthrough series. Jenkins X 3. x has focussed on clearer lines of separation, making the architecture significantly more pluggable, extensible and maintainable. With better tooling including UIs and more reliable guard rails for installations and upgrades. Jenkins X 3 also minimises abstractions and wrapping; so it promotes the direct use of open source projects like Helm, Helmfile and Tekton. Decoupling the management of Cloud infrastructure away from Jenkins X to tools that are better suited for the job. Jenkins X has started with Terraform and this manages all the cloud resources needed by Jenkins X Kubernetes cluster Cloud Service Accounts IAM bindings Storage buckets Over time Jenkins X plans to support other tools (aided by the Kubernetes Cluster API ) users in the Kubernetes ecosystem leverage such as crossplane.</description></item><item><title>Blog: New features in the pipelines visualizer UI</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2021-01-18-blog-new-features-in-the-pipelines-visualizer-ui/</link><pubDate>Mon, 18 Jan 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2021-01-18-blog-new-features-in-the-pipelines-visualizer-ui/</guid><description>New features in the pipelines visualizer UI Pipeline View Homepage Roadmap Contributing The Jenkins X Pipelines Visualizer UI has recently received a number of new features, so let’s do a little tour of these new features! When viewing a pipeline, the biggest new feature is the collapsed logs. No more hundreds - or thousands - of log lines, we now group the logs per-container (step), which are collapsed by default. Along with the status of the step and its duration, so it’s easier to go to the interesting part of the logs. Clicking on a log line will expand the logs for this specific container. You can also use the “Toggle Steps” button to expand/collapse the logs for all the steps at once. While we’re talking about the logs, you can notice the 2 new buttons: View raw logs Download raw logs On top of the logs, we now display some information about the pipeline: the pipeline meta information : name, context, build, and a link to see the raw YAML representation of the pipeline the pipeline status : status, started/finished date/time, and duration the pipeline source : git repository, pull request or branch, commit SHA, author the pipeline stages , with links to see the timeline of the steps in each stage. You can also click on the “Show Timeline” button to view the pipeline timeline with all stages and steps. The pipeline timeline has been improved to include all the steps for all stages, but it is currently hidden by default - to avoid using too much space. Clicking on a stage will bring you to the steps, and clicking on a step will bring you to the logs for this step. Note that for a pipeline which includes a deployment to a Preview Environment, the UI will also display a link to the application’s URL in that specific Preview Environment. The homepage got some love too, with: a few stats about the pipelines: top statuses, repositories, authors and durations - with links to filter the pipelines direct links to the git repositories and pull requests the Jenkins X logo and a favicon We started this project at v0, and we believe that now it has enough features to be a v1! On our roadmap - without any specific order - we have: #73 live refresh of a running pipeline - for now only the logs are updated live, not the meta information of the pipeline (status, stages/steps timings) #42 support local timezone - for now everything is in UTC improve the support for archived pipelines : load pipelines archived in the long-term storage Thanks to all the contributors!

It has been ‘all hands on deck’ in recent months with the focus on Jenkins X 3 alpha. First off a huge thankyou to everyone involved. The OSS community spirit has really shone through what has been a very difficult year for everyone. Knowing that people from all over the world come and help each other, share banter and work at all hours of the day to help build out a true open source cloud native continuous delivery solution for developers - it’s quite fantastic to see and amazing to be apart of. As a result of all this hard work the Beta is iminent so this is a good opportunity to thank all involved so far and to outline what to expect in the coming days. While we’ve been in the Alpha phase it has provided us with the opportunity to deprecate and remove APIs, commands and obsolete features that existed in v2. This means we will not have any code dependency on the v2 codebase and so going forward v3 will be easier to maintain without the tech debt. With that, we aim to make a big push and roll out a few last changes in preparation for Beta, here’s a couple you will notice if you are already on the Alpha. We recommend taking time to understand these, and avoid upgrading for a few days so that changes can be handled in one go, as there will be a constant stream of larger updates happening: jx requirements - this is the yaml file used to describe install needs for Jenkins X, until now there have been options available that were unsupported, confusing and in some cases did nothing. These have now all been removed and the structure of the file has changed to be CRD like including an API version. Upon upgrade jx gitops upgrade will migrate your jx-requirements.</description></item><item><title>Blog: Accelerate your Tekton with Jenkins X</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2020-11-11-blog-accelerate-your-tekton-with-jenkins-x/</link><pubDate>Wed, 11 Nov 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2020-11-11-blog-accelerate-your-tekton-with-jenkins-x/</guid><description>Accelerate your Tekton with Jenkins X Version 2. x Vision Version 3. x Using Tekton in your repository Reusing Tekton Catalog Tasks Sharing steps between Tasks Custom Pipeline Catalogs Conclusion One of the goals of Jenkins X has always been to help accelerate and automate Continuous Delivery so that developers can focus on delivering value to their customers; either by creating that new microservice or adding features to an existing project and not writing and managing pipelines. Pipeline engines like Jenkins and Tekton are awesome - they can do anything! But they start as a blank sheet of paper where you have to fill in all the details of how to compile your code, test it, verify it, tag it, release, distribute and delivery it to production. Figuring all that stuff out can take a huge amount of time to create and maintain. This gets even more complex as we are all creating more and more microservices each with their own pipelines making more and more things to create and manage. We want to be able to reuse pipelines and tasks to get work done. But at the same time we want flexibility; not all applications are the same and sometimes things need to be changed on a per team or application basis. In Jenkins X 2. x we went with a jenkins-x. xml approach to pipelines which let you inherit pipelines from reuable pipeline library and then use a composition DSL above Tekton which lets you add/remove/replace steps. jenkins-x.</description></item><item><title>Blog: Hacktoberfest</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2020-09-23-blog-hacktoberfest/</link><pubDate>Wed, 23 Sep 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2020-09-23-blog-hacktoberfest/</guid><description>Hacktoberfest Contribute to Jenkins X Contribute to jx source code Contribute to the docs Ask us questions We are excited to announce that Jenkins X will be participating in Hacktoberfest again this year!

Features Roadmap Demo Next steps Welcome to the Jenkins X Pipelines Visualizer : a new open-source read-only UI for Jenkins X, with a very specific goal and scope: visualize the pipelines and logs. This project was started at Dailymotion and quickly shared with the Jenkins X community. There is already the Octant-based UI , so why a new UI? The main reason is that Octant “is an application and is intended as a single client tool and at this time there are no plans to support hosted versions of Octant” - see this thread on the Octant github repository for more information and details. So while Octant answers to a lot of use-cases, there is one for which it is not suited: quickly printing the build logs on a browser, for a specific pipeline. We want to be able to click on a link from a Pull/Merge Request, and get the pipeline logs. This is the specific use-case covered by the Pipelines Visualizer. We want to keep it small, focused, and fast. It’s a read-only UI, so there won’t be “actions” to trigger a pipeline - because it can already be done using “chatops” commands in the Pull Request for example. But there are a few interesting features already: first, it’s very fast to get the logs. Much faster than the old JXUI. it can retrieve the logs from pipelines that have been garbage-collected - if you configure the URL of the buckets where the logs are stored. it has URLs compatible with the old JXUI - so it’s very easy to replace the old JXUI with this new UI and keep all the links working.</description></item><item><title>Blog: Jenkins X Talks at CDCon</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2020-09-16-blog-jenkins-x-talks-at-cdcon/</link><pubDate>Wed, 16 Sep 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2020-09-16-blog-jenkins-x-talks-at-cdcon/</guid><description>Jenkins X Talks at CDCon Wednesday, October 7 Thursday, October 8 Register for CDCon There will be six Jenkins X talks given by various speakers at the first-ever CDCon on October 7-8. The two-day virtual event, hosted by the Continuous Delivery Foundation, will focus on improving the world’s capacity to deliver software with security and speed. Register to attend the virtual event for only 25 USD and get access to all of the following Jenkins X talks and more. A CI/CD Framework for Production Machine Learning at Massive Scale (using Jenkins X and Seldon Core) Speaker: Alejandro Saucedo, Seldon Time: 1:15 PM PDT Managing production machine learning systems as internal data science infrastructure requirements grow, has uncovered new challenges which have required fundamentally different approaches to that of traditional CI/CD in software engineering. In this talk we will dive into the work we are doing at the SIG-MLOps and the CD Foundation towards developing the methodologies that encompass best practices to continuously integrate and deploy machine learning in production at massive scale. In this talk, we’ll provide key insights on the core MLOps concepts, as well as a hands-on coding example where we take a text classification model through its training, deployment and promotion as canary and shadow deployments, which will also allow us to get deeper and more specific insight on our production environment. Dailymotion’s Continuous Delivery Story Speaker: Vincent Behar, Dailymotion Time: 3:30 PM PDT In this session, Vincent will share Dailymotion’s Continuous Delivery story with Jenkins, Jenkins X and Tekton. He will come back on the initial state and issues faced on the CI/CD topic, and how it was solved. He will insist on the practices that were put in place and the benefits that resulted from switching to Jenkins X. He will conclude with the new challenges brought by improving Dailymotion’s Continuous Delivery platform. If you are wondering if Jenkins X is the right tool for you, and the impact it can have on your team(s), then this is the right session for you! Moving from Jenkins to Jenkins X: Scaling and Accelerating CI/CD Speaker: Dr Michael Garbade, Education Ecosystem Time: 12:00 PM PDT Jenkins has served as a continuous integration (CI) tool long before the emergence of Kubernetes and distributed systems running on cloud-native platforms. Working with Jenkins as a stand-alone open-source tool has proved to be extremely difficult for distributed systems engineers, as it is designed for small projects and not scalable to bigger projects.</description></item><item><title>Blog: Welcome to Jenkins X 3.x alpha!</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2020-09-16-blog-welcome-to-jenkins-x-3-x-alpha/</link><pubDate>Wed, 16 Sep 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2020-09-16-blog-welcome-to-jenkins-x-3-x-alpha/</guid><description>Welcome to Jenkins X 3. x alpha! We are very pleased to announce the alpha release of Jenkins X version 3 You can read more about the overview of the architecture and components here. This release has lots of benefits over version 2 is much easier to use, understand and manage. It is more flexible and simpler to configure for different infrastructures and cloud providers. The new release works well with any combination of helm 3, helmfile, kpt and/or kustomize. For those who’ve used Jenkins X version 2 you can check out a comparison of the two versions Here is a demo video showing how to get started with Jenkins X on Google Cloud with Terraform and Vault : We also did a live demo of getting started and using version 3 at the octant office hours last week. We also included the helmfile based preview environments enhancement via the new jx-preview plugin which makes it much easier to make more sophisticated previews such as using multiple namespaces for you previews using per preview namespaces or deploying previews into shared namespaces (e. g. via Canaries) using helmfile to cleanly remove resources We now have support, via Terraform for 2 of the big 3 public clouds: Amazon Google Azure support is getting really close; if you’d like to help get it ready join us on slack Also when using your laptop or local kubernetes cluster without terraform we support: Minikube so you can run Jenkins X on your laptop On-Premises so you can use any vanilla kubernetes cluster We are working on improving the UX of the installation/upgrade; we’re hoping to soon have a pure terraform (or Terraform Cloud) way to spin up a Jenkins X installation on a public cloud with a minimum of fuss. We’ll hopefully blog about that soon… So please take it for a spin and let us know what you think ! If you can think of any ways we can improve let us know! ← Previous.</description></item><item><title>Blog: Octant: the OSS UI for Jenkins X</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2020-08-06-blog-octant-the-oss-ui-for-jenkins-x/</link><pubDate>Thu, 06 Aug 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2020-08-06-blog-octant-the-oss-ui-for-jenkins-x/</guid><description>Octant: the OSS UI for Jenkins X Why Octant? Features Demo A common question we have heard in the community over the years is Is there an open source UI for Jenkins X?. Well we now have an answer: its Octant using the octant-jx plugin. We love Octant because: open source and very easy to extend with plugins in Go or TypeScript/JavaScript lets you visualise and work with all kubernetes and custom resources across multiple clusters thanks to octant-jx has awesome integration with Jenkins X components like apps, environments, pipelines, repositories etc. Longer term we’re planning on making most of the developer and operations features of Jenkins X available through the UI via octant-jx. e. g. we hope as part of Jenkins X 3. x you’ll be able to install or upgrade Jenkins X and watch the installation proceed all via Octant. But already right now today you can: view applications, environments, pipelines, repositories for a pipeline quickly navigate to: its Pod, Log, Pull Request or Preview Environment for each step you can view the step detail or log of the step its Pod, Log, Pull Request or Preview Environment for each step you can view the step detail or log of the step see the various jobs and pipelines used to operate Jenkins X itself over time will add management UI capabilities for installing, upgrading and administering Jenkins Find out more about installing and using Octant here. We did a demo of octant-jx at the last office hours. We also presented octant-jx at the octant office hours this week. Here is a demo video showing octant in action with Jenkins X : ← Previous.</description></item></channel></rss>
