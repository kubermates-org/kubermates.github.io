Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform | Product Trial About the author Marco Bill More like this Blog post Blog post Blog post Keep exploring Browse by channel Automation Artificial intelligence Open hybrid cloud Security Edge computing Infrastructure Applications Virtualization Share IT leaders face many challenges today, but few are as daunting as this: How do you keep up with the pace of change when your existing IT infrastructure is already so complex? For many enterprises, the primary source of that complexity is the struggle to manage containerized applications at scale across diverse environments—from on-premises data centers to multiple public clouds. This fragmentation can lead to inconsistent operations and vendor lock-in, which stifles agility and innovation. As we navigate the era of AI, IT leaders need a unified, predictable way to manage it all so that your teams can focus on higher-value work. I’ve had the unique opportunity to see this problem from both sides. In my previous roles leading customer-facing teams, I saw firsthand how our customers leveraged Red Hat OpenShift to tackle their most complex challenges, such as streamlining their hybrid cloud experiences and reducing operational complexity. It was profoundly rewarding to see them use our platform to break free from the status quo. Now, as the CIO of Red Hat, my perspective has shifted to that of an internal customer. I see the immense value of OpenShift even more clearly because we also use it to run Red Hat’s business. We are our own customer zero, not because our leadership team mandates it, but because the product works for us. Our experience has been a testament to the platform’s power to create consistency across our hybrid cloud environment, which has been critical for managing our global operations. Our teams have seen significant improvements, including shorter cycle times from code to production and better standardization of application architectures. By using OpenShift, our applications have improved cloud agility, allowing them to move across our hybrid cloud environment without concern for the underlying infrastructure."><meta property="og:url" content="https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-09-08-taming-hybrid-cloud-complexity-a-path-to-true-agility/"><meta property="og:site_name" content="Kubermates"><meta property="og:title" content="Taming hybrid cloud complexity: A path to true agility"><meta property="og:description" content="Taming hybrid cloud complexity: A path to true agility Learn more about Red Hat OpenShift for Cloud-Native Application Platforms Want guidance on other tech challenges?

Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform | Product Trial About the author Marco Bill More like this Blog post Blog post Blog post Keep exploring Browse by channel Automation Artificial intelligence Open hybrid cloud Security Edge computing Infrastructure Applications Virtualization Share IT leaders face many challenges today, but few are as daunting as this: How do you keep up with the pace of change when your existing IT infrastructure is already so complex? For many enterprises, the primary source of that complexity is the struggle to manage containerized applications at scale across diverse environments—from on-premises data centers to multiple public clouds. This fragmentation can lead to inconsistent operations and vendor lock-in, which stifles agility and innovation. As we navigate the era of AI, IT leaders need a unified, predictable way to manage it all so that your teams can focus on higher-value work. I've had the unique opportunity to see this problem from both sides. In my previous roles leading customer-facing teams, I saw firsthand how our customers leveraged Red Hat OpenShift to tackle their most complex challenges, such as streamlining their hybrid cloud experiences and reducing operational complexity. It was profoundly rewarding to see them use our platform to break free from the status quo. Now, as the CIO of Red Hat, my perspective has shifted to that of an internal customer. I see the immense value of OpenShift even more clearly because we also use it to run Red Hat’s business. We are our own customer zero, not because our leadership team mandates it, but because the product works for us. Our experience has been a testament to the platform's power to create consistency across our hybrid cloud environment, which has been critical for managing our global operations. Our teams have seen significant improvements, including shorter cycle times from code to production and better standardization of application architectures. By using OpenShift, our applications have improved cloud agility, allowing them to move across our hybrid cloud environment without concern for the underlying infrastructure.</p></div></div></section><div class=td-content><p>Open the original post ↗ <a href=https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/taming-hybrid-cloud-complexity-path-true-agility>https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/taming-hybrid-cloud-complexity-path-true-agility</a></p></div><footer class="mt-4 pt-3 border-top d-flex flex-wrap gap-2 align-items-center"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-sm" href=https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/taming-hybrid-cloud-complexity-path-true-agility target=_blank rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Open
