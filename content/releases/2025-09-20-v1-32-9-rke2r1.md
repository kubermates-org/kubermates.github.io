summary: 'Changes since v1.32.8+rke2r1: Charts Versions Packaged Component Versions
  Available CNIs Helpful Links This release updates Kubernetes to v1.32.9. Important
  Note If your server (control-plane) nodes were not started with the --token CLI
  flag or config file key, a randomized token was generated during initial cluster
  startup. This key is used both for joining new nodes to the cluster, and for encrypting
  cluster bootstrap data within the datastore. Ensure that you retain a copy of this
  token, as is required when restoring from backup. --token You may retrieve the token
  value from any server already joined to the cluster: cat /var/lib/rancher/rke2/server/token
