  Bottlerocket is an open source Linux distribution that is sponsored and supported
  by AWS. Bottlerocket is purpose-built for hosting container workloads. With Bottlerocket,
  you can improve the availability of containerized deployments and reduce operational
  costs by automating updates to your container infrastructure. Bottlerocket includes
  only the essential software to run containers, which improves resource usage, reduces
  security threats, and lowers management overhead. Only VMware variants of Bottlerocket
  version v1. 37. 0 and above are supported with EKS Hybrid Nodes. VMware variants
  of Bottlerocket are available for Kubernetes versions v1. 28 and above. The OS images
  for these variants include the kubelet, containerd, aws-iam-authenticator and other
  software prerequisites for EKS Hybrid Nodes.
