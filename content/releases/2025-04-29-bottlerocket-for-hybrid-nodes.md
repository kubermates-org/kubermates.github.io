  This topic describes how to connect hybrid nodes running Bottlerocket to an Amazon
  EKS cluster. Bottlerocket is an open source Linux distribution that is sponsored
  and supported by AWS. Bottlerocket is purpose-built for hosting container workloads.
  With Bottlerocket, you can improve the availability of containerized deployments
  and reduce operational costs by automating updates to your container infrastructure.
  Bottlerocket includes only the essential software to run containers, which improves
  resource usage, reduces security threats, and lowers management overhead. Only VMware
  variants of Bottlerocket version v1.37.0 and above are supported with EKS Hybrid
  Nodes. VMware variants of Bottlerocket are available for Kubernetes versions v1.28
  and above. The OS images for these variants include the kubelet, containerd, aws-iam-authenticator
  and other software prerequisites for EKS Hybrid Nodes. You can configure these components
  using a Bottlerocket settings file that includes base64 encoded user-data for the
  Bottlerocket bootstrap and admin containers. Configuring these settings enables
  Bottlerocket to use your hybrid nodes credentials provider to authenticate hybrid
  nodes to your cluster. After your hybrid nodes join the cluster, they will appear
  with status Not Ready in the Amazon EKS console and in Kubernetes-compatible tooling
  such as kubectl.'
