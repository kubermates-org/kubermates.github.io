summary: "Help improve this page To contribute to this user guide, choose the Edit\
  \ this page on GitHub link that is located in the right pane of every page. Kubernetes\
  \ rapidly evolves with new features, design updates, and bug fixes. The community\
  \ releases new Kubernetes minor versions (such as 1. 33 ) on average once every\
  \ four months. Amazon EKS follows the upstream release and deprecation cycle for\
  \ minor versions. As new Kubernetes versions become available in Amazon EKS, we\
  \ recommend that you proactively update your clusters to use the latest available\
  \ version. A minor version is under standard support in Amazon EKS for the first\
  \ 14 months after itâ\x80\x99s released. Once a version is past the end of standard\
  \ support date, it enters extended support for the next 12 months. Extended support\
  \ allows you to stay at a specific Kubernetes version for longer at an additional\
  \ cost per cluster hour. If you havenâ\x80\x99t updated your cluster before the\
  \ extended support period ends, your cluster is auto-upgraded to the oldest currently\
  \ supported extended version. Extended support is enabled by default. To disable,\
  \ see Disable EKS extended support."
