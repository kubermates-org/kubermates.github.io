summary: "Understand the Kubernetes version lifecycle on EKS Available versions on\
  \ standard support Available versions on extended support Amazon EKS Kubernetes\
  \ release calendar Get version information with AWS CLI To retrieve information\

  \ FAQs Amazon EKS extended support FAQs Help improve this page To contribute to\
  \ this user guide, choose the Edit this page on GitHub link that is located in the\
  \ right pane of every page. Kubernetes rapidly evolves with new features, design\
  \ updates, and bug fixes. The community releases new Kubernetes minor versions (such\
  \ as 1. 33 ) on average once every four months. Amazon EKS follows the upstream\
  \ release and deprecation cycle for minor versions. As new Kubernetes versions become\
  \ available in Amazon EKS, we recommend that you proactively update your clusters\
  \ to use the latest available version. 1. 33 A minor version is under standard support\
  \ in Amazon EKS for the first 14 months after itâ\x80\x99s released. Once a version\
  \ is past the end of standard support date, it enters extended support for the next\
  \ 12 months. Extended support allows you to stay at a specific Kubernetes version\
  \ for longer at an additional cost per cluster hour. If you havenâ\x80\x99t updated\
  \ your cluster before the extended support period ends, your cluster is auto-upgraded\
  \ to the oldest currently supported extended version. Extended support is enabled\
  \ by default."
