summary: "Help improve this page To contribute to this user guide, choose the Edit\
  \ this page on GitHub link that is located in the right pane of every page. Amazon\
  \ EKS platform versions represent the capabilities of the Amazon EKS cluster control\
  \ plane, such as which Kubernetes API server flags are enabled, as well as the current\
  \ Kubernetes patch version. Each Kubernetes minor version has one or more associated\
  \ Amazon EKS platform versions. The platform versions for different Kubernetes minor\
  \ versions are independent. You can retrieve your clusterâ\x80\x99s current platform\
  \ version using the AWS CLI or AWS Management Console. If you have a local cluster\
  \ on AWS Outposts, see Learn Kubernetes and Amazon EKS platform versions for AWS\
  \ Outposts instead of this topic. When a new Kubernetes minor version is available\
  \ in Amazon EKS, such as 1. 33, the initial Amazon EKS platform version for that\
  \ Kubernetes minor version starts at eks. 1. However, Amazon EKS releases new platform\
  \ versions periodically to enable new Kubernetes control plane settings and to provide\
  \ security fixes. When new Amazon EKS platform versions become available for a minor\
  \ version: The Amazon EKS platform version number is incremented ( eks. <n+1> )."
