tldr: This can be corrected by either trying to update Relying Party Trust information

summary: 'This can be corrected by either trying to update Relying Party Trust information
  from federation metadata (Relying Party Trust -> Update from Federation Metadata.
  ) or by directly adding the certificate (Relying Party Trust -> Properties -> Signature
  tab -> Add -> Select the certificate). For more information see #48655. Important:
  Rancher Kubernetes Engine (RKE/RKE1) has reached end of life as of July 31, 2025.
  Rancher versions 2.12.0 and later no longer support provisioning or managing downstream
  RKE1 clusters. We recommend replatforming RKE1 clusters to RKE2 to ensure continued
  support and security updates. Learn more about the transition here. Important: Rancher-Istio
  is now deprecated in Rancher v2.12.0; turn to the SUSE Application Collection build
  of Istio for enhanced security (included in SUSE Rancher Prime subscriptions). Detailed
  information can be found in this announcement. Important: Review the Install/Upgrade
  Notes before upgrading to any Rancher version. Rancher v2.11.8 is the latest patch
  release of Rancher v2.11. This is a Prime version release that introduces maintenance
  updates and bug fixes.'
