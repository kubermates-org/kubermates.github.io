  EKS add-ons are add-on software for Amazon EKS clusters. All Amazon EKS add-ons:
  Include the latest security patches and bug fixes. Are validated by AWS to work
  with Amazon EKS. Reduce the amount of work required to manage the add-on software.
  You can create an Amazon EKS add-on using eksctl , the AWS Management Console, or
  the AWS CLI. If the add-on requires an IAM role, see the details for the specific
  add-on in Amazon EKS add-ons for details about creating the role. Complete the following
  before you create an add-on: The cluster must exist before you create an add-on
  for it. For more information, see Create an Amazon EKS cluster. Check if your add-on
  requires an IAM role. For more information, see Verify Amazon EKS add-on version
  compatibility with a cluster. Verify that the Amazon EKS add-on version is compatabile
  with your cluster.'
