  EKS Hybrid Nodes , you join physical or virtual machines running in on-premises
  or edge environments to Amazon EKS clusters running in the AWS Cloud. This approach
  brings many benefits, but also introduces new networking concepts and architectures
  for those familiar with running Kubernetes clusters in a single network environment.
  The following sections dive deep into the Kubernetes and networking concepts for
  EKS Hybrid Nodes and details how traffic flows through the hybrid architecture.
  These sections require that you are familiar with basic Kubernetes networking knowledge,
  such as the concepts of pods, nodes, services, Kubernetes control plane, kubelet
  and kube-proxy. We recommend reading these pages in order, starting with the Networking
  concepts for hybrid nodes , then the Kubernetes concepts for hybrid nodes , and
  finally the Network traffic flows for hybrid nodes. Networking concepts for hybrid
