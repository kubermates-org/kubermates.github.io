tldr: This release updates Kubernetes to v1. 33.
summary: 'This release updates Kubernetes to v1. 33. 4. Important Note If your server
  (control-plane) nodes were not started with the --token CLI flag or config file
  key, a randomized token was generated during initial cluster startup. This key is
  used both for joining new nodes to the cluster, and for encrypting cluster bootstrap
  data within the datastore. Ensure that you retain a copy of this token, as is required
  when restoring from backup. You may retrieve the token value from any server already
  joined to the cluster: As always, we welcome and appreciate feedback from our community
