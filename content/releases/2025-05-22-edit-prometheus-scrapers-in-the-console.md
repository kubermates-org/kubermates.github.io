  this page on GitHub link that is located in the right pane of every page. Prometheus
  is a monitoring and time series database that scrapes endpoints. It provides the
  ability to query, aggregate, and store collected data. You can also use it for alerting
  and alert aggregation. This topic explains how to set up Prometheus as either a
  managed or open source option. Monitoring Amazon EKS control plane metrics is a
  common use case. Amazon Managed Service for Prometheus is a Prometheus-compatible
  monitoring and alerting service that makes it easy to monitor containerized applications
  and infrastructure at scale. It is a fully-managed service that automatically scales
  the ingestion, storage, querying, and alerting of your metrics. It also integrates
  with AWS security services to enable fast and secure access to your data. You can
  use the open-source PromQL query language to query your metrics and alert on them.
  Also, you can use alert manager in Amazon Managed Service for Prometheus to set
  up alerting rules for critical alerts. You can then send these critical alerts as
  notifications to an Amazon SNS topic.
