summary: 'Help improve this page To contribute to this user guide, choose the Edit
  this page on GitHub link that is located in the right pane of every page. EKS Auto
  Mode extends AWS management of Kubernetes clusters beyond the cluster itself, to
  allow AWS to also set up and manage the infrastructure that enables the smooth operation
  of your workloads. You can delegate key infrastructure decisions and leverage the
  expertise of AWS for day-to-day operations. Cluster infrastructure managed by AWS
  includes many Kubernetes capabilities as core components, as opposed to add-ons,
  such as compute autoscaling, pod and service networking, application load balancing,
  cluster DNS, block storage, and GPU support. To get started, you can deploy a new
  EKS Auto Mode cluster or enable EKS Auto Mode on an existing cluster. You can deploy,
  upgrade, or modify your EKS Auto Mode clusters using eksctl, the AWS CLI, the AWS
  Management Console, EKS APIs, or your preferred infrastructure-as-code tools. With
  EKS Auto Mode, you can continue using your preferred Kubernetes-compatible tools.
  EKS Auto Mode integrates with AWS services like Amazon EC2, Amazon EBS, and ELB,
  leveraging AWS cloud resources that follow best practices. These resources are automatically
  scaled, cost-optimized, and regularly updated to help minimize operational costs
  and overhead. EKS Auto Mode provides the following high-level features: Streamline
  Kubernetes Cluster Management : EKS Auto Mode streamlines EKS management by providing
  production-ready clusters with minimal operational overhead. With EKS Auto Mode,
  you can run demanding, dynamic workloads confidently, without requiring deep EKS
  expertise. Application Availability : EKS Auto Mode dynamically adds or removes
  nodes in your EKS cluster based on the demands of your Kubernetes applications.'
