  Prime subscriptions). Detailed information can be found in this announcement. Rancher
  v2.13.0 is the latest minor release of Rancher. This is a Community version release
  that introduces new features, enhancements, and various updates. Rancher now supports
  Kubernetes v1.34. See #51252 for information on Rancher support for Kubernetes v1.34.
  You can view the upstream Kubernetes changelogs for v1.34 for a complete list of
  changes. Official support for Kubernetes v1.31 and older versions has been removed.
  You can no longer provision new RKE2 or K3s clusters using the Kubernetes versions
  that fall outside of the supported range (v1.32 - v1.34).'
