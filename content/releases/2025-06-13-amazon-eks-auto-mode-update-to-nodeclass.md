  Node Classes are templates that offer granular control over the configuration of
  your EKS Auto Mode managed nodes. A Node Class defines infrastructure-level settings
  that apply to groups of nodes in your EKS cluster, including network configuration,
  storage settings, and resource tagging. This topic explains how to create and configure
  a Node Class to meet your specific operational requirements. When you need to customize
  how EKS Auto Mode provisions and configures EC2 instances beyond the default settings,
  creating a Node Class gives you precise control over critical infrastructure parameters.
  For example, you can specify private subnet placement for enhanced security, configure
  instance ephemeral storage for performance-sensitive workloads, or apply custom
  tagging for cost allocation. To create a NodeClass , follow these steps: NodeClass
  Create a YAML file (for example, nodeclass. yaml ) with your Node Class configuration
  Create a YAML file (for example, nodeclass. yaml ) with your Node Class configuration
  nodeclass. yaml Apply the configuration to your cluster using kubectl Apply the
  configuration to your cluster using kubectl kubectl Reference the Node Class in
  your Node Pool configuration. For more information, see Create a Node Pool for EKS
  Auto Mode. Reference the Node Class in your Node Pool configuration.'
