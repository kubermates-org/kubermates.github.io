  When upgrading, carefully review the changes that have occurred between the old
  and new versions for your cluster. Kubernetes 1. 33 is now available in Amazon EKS.
  For more information about Kubernetes 1. 33 , see the official release announcement.
  The Dynamic Resource Allocation beta Kubernetes API is enabled. This beta API improves
  the experience of scheduling and monitoring workloads that require resources such
  as GPUs. The beta API is defined by the Kubernetes community, and might change in
  future versions of Kubernetes. Carefully review Feature stages in the Kubernetes
  documentation to understand the implications of using beta APIs. AWS is not releasing
  an EKS-optimized Amazon Linux 2 AMI for Kubernetes 1.
