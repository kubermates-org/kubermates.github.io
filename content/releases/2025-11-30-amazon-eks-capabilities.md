  | Create kro capability Amazon EKS Capabilities is a layered set of fully managed
  cluster features that help accelerate developer velocity and offload the complexity
  of building and scaling with Kubernetes. EKS Capabilities are Kubernetes-native
  features for declarative continuous deployment, AWS resource management, and Kubernetes
  resource authoring and orchestration, all fully managed by AWS. With EKS Capabilities,
  you can focus more on building and scaling your workloads, offloading the operational
  burden of these foundational platform services to AWS. These capabilities run within
  EKS rather than in your clusters, eliminating the need to install, maintain, and
  scale critical platform components on your worker nodes. To get started, you can
  create one or more EKS Capabilities on a new or existing EKS cluster. To do this,
  you can use the AWS CLI, the AWS Management Console, EKS APIs, eksctl, or your preferred
  infrastructure-as-code tools. While EKS Capabilities are designed to work together,
  they are independent cloud resources that you can pick and choose based on your
  use case and requirements. All Kubernetes versions supported by EKS are supported
  for EKS Capabilities. EKS Capabilities are available in all AWS commercial Regions
  where Amazon EKS is available. For a list of supported Regions, see Amazon EKS endpoints
  and quotas in the AWS General Reference. ACK enables the management of AWS resources
  using Kubernetes APIs, allowing you to create and manage S3 buckets, RDS databases,
  IAM roles, and other AWS resources using Kubernetes custom resources.'
