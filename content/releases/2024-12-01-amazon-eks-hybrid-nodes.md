  in Amazon EKS clusters. AWS manages the AWS-hosted Kubernetes control plane of the
  Amazon EKS cluster, and you manage the hybrid nodes that run in your on-premises
  or edge environments. This unifies Kubernetes management across your environments
  and offloads Kubernetes control plane management to AWS for your on-premises and
  edge applications. Amazon EKS Hybrid Nodes works with any on-premises hardware or
  virtual machines, bringing the efficiency, scalability, and availability of Amazon
  EKS to wherever your applications need to run. You can use a wide range of Amazon
  EKS features with Amazon EKS Hybrid Nodes including Amazon EKS add-ons, Amazon EKS
