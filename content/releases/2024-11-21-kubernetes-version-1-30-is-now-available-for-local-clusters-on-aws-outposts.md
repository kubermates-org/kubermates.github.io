  cluster platform versions represent the capabilities of the Amazon EKS cluster on
  AWS Outposts. The versions include the components that run on the Kubernetes control
  plane, which Kubernetes API server flags are enabled. They also include the current
  Kubernetes patch version. Each Kubernetes minor version has one or more associated
  platform versions. The platform versions for different Kubernetes minor versions
  are independent. The platform versions for local clusters and Amazon EKS clusters
  in the cloud are independent. When a new Kubernetes minor version is available for
  local clusters, such as 1. 31 , the initial platform version for that Kubernetes
  minor version starts at eks-local-outposts. 1. However, Amazon EKS releases new
  platform versions periodically to enable new Kubernetes control plane settings and
  to provide security fixes. When new local cluster platform versions become available
  for a minor version: The platform version number is incremented ( eks-local-outposts.'
