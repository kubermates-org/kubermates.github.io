tldr: 'They can be corrected by either of two methods: Updating the Relying Party
  Trust information from federation metadata (Relying Party Trust -> Update from Federation
  Metadata. ) Directly adding the certificate (Relying Party Trust -> Properties ->

summary: 'They can be corrected by either of two methods: Updating the Relying Party

  Metadata. ) Directly adding the certificate (Relying Party Trust -> Properties ->
  Signature tab -> Add -> Select the certificate). For more information see #48655.
  Important: Rancher-Istio is now deprecated in Rancher v2.12.0; turn to the SUSE
  Application Collection build of Istio for enhanced security (included in SUSE Rancher
  Prime subscriptions). Detailed information can be found in this announcement. Rancher
  v2.12.1 is the latest patch release of Rancher. This is a Community and Prime version
  release that introduces maintenance updates and bug fixes. To learn more about Rancher
  Prime, see our page on the Rancher Prime Platform. See the full list of changes.
  This release addresses the following Rancher security issues: POSTs to the Rancher
  API endpoints are now limited to 1 Mi; this is configurable through the settings
  if you need a larger limit. The Rancher authentication endpoints are configured
  independently of the main public API (as you might need bigger payloads in the other
  API endpoints). Suppose you need to increase the maximum allowed payload for authentication.'
