summary: 'Help improve this page To contribute to this user guide, choose the Edit
  this page on GitHub link that is located in the right pane of every page. Amazon
  EKS cluster insights provide detection of issues and recommendations to resolve
  them to help you manage your cluster. Every Amazon EKS cluster undergoes automatic,
  recurring checks against an Amazon EKS curated list of insights. These insight checks
  are fully managed by Amazon EKS and offer recommendations on how to address any
  findings. Configuration insights : Identifies misconfigurations in your EKS Hybrid
  Nodes setup that could impair functionality of your cluster or workloads. Upgrade
  insights : Identifies issues that could impact your ability to upgrade to new versions
  of Kubernetes. Frequency : Amazon EKS refreshes cluster insights every 24 hours,
  or you can manually refresh them to see the latest status. For example, you can
  manually refresh cluster insights after addressing an issue to see if the issue
  was resolved. Permissions : Amazon EKS automatically creates a cluster access entry
  for cluster insights in every EKS cluster. This entry gives EKS permission to view
  information about your cluster. Amazon EKS uses this information to generate the
  insights. For more information, see AmazonEKSClusterInsightsPolicy.'
