  Important: Rancher-Istio is now deprecated in Rancher v2.12.0; turn to the SUSE
  Application Collection build of Istio for enhanced security (included in SUSE Rancher
  Prime subscriptions). Detailed information can be found in this announcement. Rancher
  v2.12.2 is the latest patch release of Rancher. This is a Community and Prime version
  release that introduces maintenance updates and bug fixes. To learn more about Rancher
  Prime, see our page on the Rancher Prime Platform. For more information on new features
  in the general minor release see the v2.12.0 release notes. See the full list of
  changes. Therefore, a user with the Manage Users permission could potentially deny
  any user, including admins, from logging in. To prevent this, usernames have been
  made immutable once set, and it is not possible to update or create a user with
  a username that is already in use.'
