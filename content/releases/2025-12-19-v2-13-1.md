  Important: Rancher-Istio has been deprecated in Rancher v2.12.0; turn to the SUSE
  Application Collection build of Istio for enhanced security (included in SUSE Rancher
  Prime subscriptions). Detailed information can be found in this announcement. Rancher
  v2.13.1 is the latest patch release of Rancher. This is a Community version release
  that introduces maintenance updates and bug fixes. For more information on new features
  in the general minor release see the v2.13.0 release notes. Fixed an issue where
  in air-gapped environments when attempting to access the legacy v3 API-UI page directly
  via the host URL ( <RANCHER-SERVER-URL>/v3 ), the page fails to load and displays
  a blank page. <RANCHER-SERVER-URL>/v3 Fixed an issue with cluster provisioning not
  working as expected in air-gapped Rancher setups due to capi-controller-manager
  not coming up Active. See #52833 and #52495 for further information. capi-controller-manager
  Fixed an issue where when attempting to provision an IPv6-only K3s cluster (either
  Custom or Node-Driver) with IPv6 CIDRs, the cluster would become stuck in a provisioning
  state and does not become Active.'
