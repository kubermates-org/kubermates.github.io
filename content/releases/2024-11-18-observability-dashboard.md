summary: "Help improve this page To contribute to this user guide, choose the Edit\
  \ this page on GitHub link that is located in the right pane of every page. The\
  \ Amazon EKS console includes an observability dashboard that gives visibility into\
  \ the performance of your cluster. The information it provides helps you to quickly\
  \ detect, troubleshoot, and remediate issues. You can open the applicable section\
  \ of the observability dashboard by choosing an item in the Health and performance\
  \ summary. This summary is included in several places, including the Observability\
  \ tab. The observability dashboard is split into several tabs. The Health and performance\
  \ summary lists the quantity of items in various categories. Each number acts as\
  \ a hyperlink to a location in the observability dashboard with a list for that\
  \ category. Cluster health provides important notifications to be aware of, some\
  \ of which you may need to take action on as soon as possible. With this list, you\
  \ can see descriptions and the affected resources. Cluster health includes two tables:\
  \ Health issues and Configuration insights. To refresh the status of Health issues\
  \ , choose the refresh button ( â\x86» )."
