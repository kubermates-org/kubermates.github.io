tldr: 'They can be corrected by either of two methods: Updating the Relying Party
  Trust information from federation metadata (Relying Party Trust -> Update from Federation

summary: 'They can be corrected by either of two methods: Updating the Relying Party

  Important: Rancher-Istio is now deprecated in Rancher v2.12.0; turn to the SUSE
  Application Collection build of Istio for enhanced security (included in SUSE Rancher
  Prime subscriptions). Detailed information can be found in this announcement. Rancher
  v2.12.4 is the latest patch release of Rancher. This is a Prime version release
  that introduces maintenance updates and bug fixes. To learn more about Rancher Prime,
  see our page on the Rancher Prime Platform. For more information on new features
  in the general minor release see the v2.12.0 release notes. See the full list of
  changes. Fixed an issue where Standard Users assigned the Cluster Owner role on
  a downstream cluster were unable to view or restore existing etcd snapshots via
  the Rancher UI. Cluster Owners now have the correct permissions to see and restore
  snapshots as expected.'
