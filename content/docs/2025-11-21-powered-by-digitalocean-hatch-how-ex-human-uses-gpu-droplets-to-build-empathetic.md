  Hacktoberfest 2025: Celebrate All Things Open Source! By Martin Nguyen Updated:
  November 21, 2025 3 min read GPU Droplets are now DigitalOcean GradientAI GPU Droplets.
  Learn more about DigitalOcean GradientAI , our suite of AI products. Hatch is DigitalOcean’s
  global program for startups, which provides startups with credits and discounts
  on computing resources so they can build and scale without worrying about costs.
  In 2024, Hatch significantly revamped the program to better support those building
  businesses in the artificial intelligence sector, providing AI/ML startups with
  discounts for GPU Droplets and free access to DigitalOcean’s premium support in
  addition to credits. Ex-human , a startup building empathetic generative AI solutions
  backed by A16Z GAMES’ SPEEDRUN accelerator, chose the Hatch program to help serve
  their customers with AI models—read on to hear about their experience with Hatch
  so far. Inspired by the characters Sam from Her (2013) and Joi from Blade Runner
  2049 (2017) , Artem Rodichev, founder and CEO of Ex-human, sought to build a future
  where humans interact with digital humans and characters on a daily basis, taking
  the form of friends, mentors, lovers, and more. After a stint at Replika, Rodichev
  saw that humans were building deeper connections with their AI companions and wanted
  to create a solution that was both viable for consumers and businesses. Ex-human
  brings their AI characters to life through text, images, video, and audio with unlimited
  scalability and customizability that opens up possibilities for numerous use cases.
  Partnering with companies such as Grindr, who are using Ex-human’s technology to
  bring an AI wingman to life, this technology has the opportunity to help humans
  form stronger bonds in both physical and digital worlds. Building AI technology
  requires large amounts of computing power, which can come at a high price, especially
  for a new business. Ex-human chose the Hatch program because it offers exclusive
  pricing for access to on-demand NVIDIA H100 GPU Droplets at $1.90/GPU/hour *. Despite
  the favorable cost, Ex-human finds that there are no tradeoffs with power and reliability,
  giving them a solution that works for their budget and delivers for their needs.'
