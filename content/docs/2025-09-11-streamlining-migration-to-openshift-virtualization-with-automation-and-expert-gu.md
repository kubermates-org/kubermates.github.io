  Virtualization Share Modernizing your infrastructure often involves optimizing resources.
  One such approach is to converge virtualization and container platforms. Red Hat
  OpenShift Virtualization provides a powerful solution, allowing you to run virtual
  machines (VM) and containers side by side while enabling you to easily migrate to
  modern platforms at your own pace. Migrating traditional VM workloads demands a
  well planned approach. This is where the synergy of Red Hat OpenShift Virtualization,
  Red Hat Ansible Automation Platform, and Red Hat Consulting, or your preferred partner
  services, is key to success. OpenShift Virtualization is an attractive solution
  for organizations pursuing cost optimization, modernization of applications, and
  unified workflows. But migration must be streamlined. And once migrated, you must
  manage the ongoing Day 2 needs, including the VM lifecycle and the related infrastructure.
  Red Hat Ansible Automation Platform is a powerful automation solution that helps
  you in three key areas: Migration at-scale for VMs and related infrastructure Ongoing
  management of these resources, once moved Lifecycle management of VMs remaining
  on other existing platforms, or any virtualization platform Ansible Automation Platform
  includes content collections for more than 200 technologies designed to jumpstart
  your use of automation and these can be helpful in managing infrastructure related
  to your VM-based operations. New collections are continuously available, and in
  particular there are two new content collections for migrating to OpenShift Virtualization,
  and for Day 2 management of them. This article introduces you to both. Considerations
  when migrating from a traditional hypervisor to OpenShift Virtualization include:
  Understanding VM dependencies: Discovering and managing interconnected VM configurations
  Encrypted disks and storage compatibility: Ensuring data security and storage interoperability
  Minimizing downtime: Executing migrations with minimal disruption to critical services
  Robust rollback planning: Developing and testing strategies for seamless recovery
  Integration with modern CI/CD pipelines: Incorporating migrated VMs into automated
  development and release workflows Both Ansible Automation Platform and OpenShift
  Virtualization help you meet these challenges.'
