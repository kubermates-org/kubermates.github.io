  How to use Feedback and Questions Headlamp is an open‑source, extensible Kubernetes
  SIG UI project designed to let you explore, manage, and debug cluster resources.
  Karpenter is a Kubernetes Autoscaling SIG node provisioning project that helps clusters
  scale quickly and efficiently. It launches new nodes in seconds, selects appropriate
  instance types for workloads, and manages the full node lifecycle, including scale-down.
  The new Headlamp Karpenter Plugin adds real-time visibility into Karpenter’s activity
  directly from the Headlamp UI. It shows how Karpenter resources relate to Kubernetes
  objects, displays live metrics, and surfaces scaling events as they happen. You
  can inspect pending pods during provisioning, review scaling decisions, and edit
  Karpenter-managed resources with built-in validation. The Karpenter plugin was made
  as part of a LFX mentor project. The Karpenter plugin for Headlamp aims to make
  it easier for Kubernetes users and operators to understand, debug, and fine-tune
  autoscaling behavior in their clusters. Now we will give a brief tour of the Headlamp
  plugin. Easily see how Karpenter Resources like NodeClasses, NodePool and NodeClaims
  connect with core Kubernetes resources like Pods, Nodes etc. Get instant insights
  of Resource Usage v/s Limits, Allowed disruptions, Pending Pods, Provisioning Latency
  and many more. Shows which instances are being provisioned for your workloads and
  understand the reason behind why Karpenter made those choices.
