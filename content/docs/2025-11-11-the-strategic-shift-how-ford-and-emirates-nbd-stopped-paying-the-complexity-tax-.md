  Edge computing Infrastructure Applications Virtualization Share For most large-scale
  enterprises today, the hybrid cloud isn''t a strategy, it’s just the reality. Most
  organizations are running in both worlds: they have modern, cloud-native applications
  in containers, and critical, often mission-critical, systems in virtual machines
  (VMs). The reality is that running two separate virtualization stacks creates silos,
  complexity, and unnecessary operational cost – what can be called the complexity
  tax. It slows down your operations and application teams, strains budgets, and ultimately
  makes it harder to deliver value to the business. We recently spoke with leaders
  who decided to tackle this fragmentation head-on: Sandeep Kulkarni from Ford Motor
  Co. and Ali Rey from Emirates NBD. They shared their journey of unifying VMs and
  containers on one cohesive platform. Their story offers a clear, straightforward
  playbook for any IT leader facing a similar challenge. Both Ford and Emirates NBD
  are giants in their respective industries, but they faced the same fundamental challenge:
  not every application needs to be modernized but they can be future-proofed with
  a modern platform. Ford , an iconic, 122-year-old brand, runs thousands of applications.
  While the company has an aggressive modernization journey underway, many core systems
  may remain in VMs waiting for the application modernization journey or due to their
  fundamental architecture, compliance, or legacy vendor support. Emirates NBD , one
  of the largest banks in the Middle East, operates 24/7.'
