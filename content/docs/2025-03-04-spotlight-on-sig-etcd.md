summary: 'Spotlight on SIG etcd Introducing SIG etcd Becoming a Kubernetes Special
  Interest Group (SIG) The road ahead Getting involved In this SIG etcd spotlight
  we talked with James Blair , Marek Siarkowicz , Wenjia Zhang , and Benjamin Wang
  to learn a bit more about this Kubernetes Special Interest Group. Frederico: Hello,
  thank you for the time! Let’s start with some introductions, could you tell us a
  bit about yourself, your role and how you got involved in Kubernetes. Benjamin:
  Hello, I am Benjamin. I am a SIG etcd Tech Lead and one of the etcd maintainers.
  I work for VMware, which is part of the Broadcom group. I got involved in Kubernetes
  & etcd & CSI ( Container Storage Interface ) because of work and also a big passion
  for open source. I have been working on Kubernetes & etcd (and also CSI) since 2020.
  James: Hey team, I’m James, a co-chair for SIG etcd and etcd maintainer. I work
  at Red Hat as a Specialist Architect helping people adopt cloud native technology.
  I got involved with the Kubernetes ecosystem in 2019. Around the end of 2022 I noticed
  how the etcd community and project needed help so started contributing as often
  as I could. There is a saying in our community that "you come for the technology,
  and stay for the people": for me this is absolutely real, it’s been a wonderful
  journey so far and I’m excited to support our community moving forward.'
