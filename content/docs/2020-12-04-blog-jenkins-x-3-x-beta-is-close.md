summary: 'It has been ‘all hands on deck’ in recent months with the focus on Jenkins
  X 3 alpha. First off a huge thankyou to everyone involved. The OSS community spirit
  has really shone through what has been a very difficult year for everyone. Knowing
  that people from all over the world come and help each other, share banter and work
  at all hours of the day to help build out a true open source cloud native continuous
  delivery solution for developers - it’s quite fantastic to see and amazing to be
  apart of. As a result of all this hard work the Beta is iminent so this is a good
  opportunity to thank all involved so far and to outline what to expect in the coming
  days. While we’ve been in the Alpha phase it has provided us with the opportunity
  to deprecate and remove APIs, commands and obsolete features that existed in v2.
  This means we will not have any code dependency on the v2 codebase and so going
  forward v3 will be easier to maintain without the tech debt. With that, we aim to
  make a big push and roll out a few last changes in preparation for Beta, here’s
  a couple you will notice if you are already on the Alpha. We recommend taking time
  to understand these, and avoid upgrading for a few days so that changes can be handled
  in one go, as there will be a constant stream of larger updates happening: Balancing
  upgrades with continuous delivery brings many challenges. However with Kubernetes,
  GitOps, Jenkins X version streams (including the monthly LTS coming soon) and other
  tools like kpt makes the process more transparent and provides a greater level of
  high availability. Jenkins X automatically upgrades its own infrastructure with
  every version stream release and we haven’t experienced any disruption during the
  alpha period so far. We aim to continue this, but when we know there will be disruption
  we endeavour to inform and explain why ahead of time.'
