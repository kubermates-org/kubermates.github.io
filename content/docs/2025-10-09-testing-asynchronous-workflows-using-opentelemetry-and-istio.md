  for context propagation and Istio for traffic routing. Explore cost-effective approaches
  to isolate test environments without duplicating infrastructure. Asynchronous architectures
  have become a cornerstone of modern cloud native applications, enabling services
  to operate independently while maintaining system resilience and scalability. These
  architectures typically rely on message queues and event-driven communication patterns
  to decouple services, allowing them to handle varying loads and failures gracefully.
  Popular message systems in the cloud native ecosystem include Apache Kafka, RabbitMQ,
  Redis Streams, Google Cloud Pub/Sub, AWS SQS, and Azure Service Bus. Each offers
  unique capabilities for different use cases, from high-throughput streaming to reliable
  message delivery. Regardless of which system you choose, testing end-to-end workflows
  that span multiple services and asynchronous boundaries presents unique challenges
  that traditional testing approaches struggle to address effectively. This article
  explores how two CNCF projects—OpenTelemetry for distributed tracing and context
  propagation, and Istio for traffic management—can work together to create cost-effective,
  scalable testing environments for asynchronous workflows without the overhead of
  duplicating entire infrastructure stacks. Testing asynchronous systems introduces
  several complex challenges not found in synchronous, request-response architectures:
  Environment setup complexity : Asynchronous systems require multiple coordinated
  components—brokers, producers, consumers, and often additional infrastructure like
  schema registries or monitoring tools. Setting up these components correctly with
  proper security, replication, and partitioning requires significant expertise and
  time. Test isolation : Unlike synchronous calls where requests can be easily isolated,
  asynchronous messages in shared systems can interfere with each other. Ensuring
  that test data from one scenario doesn’t impact another requires careful coordination.'
