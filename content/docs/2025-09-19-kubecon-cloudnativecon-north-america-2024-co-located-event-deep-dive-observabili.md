  and Juraci Paixão Kröhling Observability Day traces its roots back to KubeCon Europe
  2022 in Valencia, where we hosted FluentCon, a co-located event dedicated exclusively
  to the Fluentd and Fluent Bit projects. The gathering was a success, and the feedback
  we received from the community made it clear that we could serve the broader observability
  space at KubeCon in an even bigger way. To make that happen, we expanded our focus
  and invited other CNCF projects to join. Just a few months later, at KubeCon US
  2022, we introduced Open Observability Day, bringing together maintainers and community
  members from projects such as Jaeger, Fluentd, Thanos, Prometheus, and OpenTelemetry.
  The response was overwhelmingly positive, and it quickly became clear that this
  effort needed to evolve into something more formal and structured. Working closely
  with the CNCF, that vision became reality—and Observability Day was officially born
  We want attendees to know that Observability Day is a community-driven gathering
  where practitioners, end users, and project maintainers come together to shape the
  future of observability. It’s not just about one tool or project, it’s about learning
  from each other, sharing best practices, and exploring how the CNCF ecosystem works
  together to solve real-world challenges. Whether you’re new to observability or
  deeply involved in projects like Prometheus, Fluent Bit, Jaeger, Thanos, or OpenTelemetry,
  you’ll leave with practical insights, valuable connections, and a clearer picture
  of where the space is heading. Most importantly, this is your chance to directly
  engage with the people building the tools you use every day. What’s new this year
  is the breadth and depth of community-driven content. Observability Day 2025 puts
  CNCF projects front and center, with maintainers and practitioners sharing the latest
  updates and lessons learned. You’ll find talks that go beyond theory—covering real-world
  scaling challenges, cost-efficient monitoring strategies, and new frontiers like
  AI observability There’s also a stronger emphasis on OpenTelemetry in action, from
  rapid adoption patterns to advanced use cases in telco, mobile, and enterprise systems.'
