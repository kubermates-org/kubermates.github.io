  October roundup, we cut through the noise to focus on the essential technical blueprints
  and policy foundations required to succeed. These articles, from key platform updates
  and critical security integrations to the future of open source legality, represent
  the core strategic reading for Q4. We highlight how Red Hat Ansible Automation Platform
  2.6 streamlines operations, how Red Hat AI 3 and its intelligent control plane transform
  GPU infrastructure, and how our strategic partnership with NVIDIA simplifies the
  AI software stack. This is the quarter for planning that prepares your organization
  not just for the next fiscal year, but for the next technological decade. What’s
  new in Red Hat Ansible Automation Platform 2.6 Ansible Automation Platform 2.6 is
  now generally available, providing new features and platform enhancements designed
  to help teams build resilient, trusted foundations for IT operations. Headlining
  the release are 3 new features that advance key outcomes: the automation dashboard
  to unlock value through measurement and reporting; the Red Hat Ansible Lightspeed
  intelligent assistant to operate more efficiently using gen AI; and the self-service
  automation portal to achieve new levels of scale across the enterprise. This release
  introduces a streamlined experience, significant architecture improvements, and
  easier access to opinionated reference architectures. It is also important to note
  that Ansible Automation Platform 2.6 is the last release supporting RPM-based installation,
  with future versions moving exclusively to containerized installations. Red Hat
  AI 3 delivers speed, accelerated delivery, and scale Red Hat AI 3, generally available
  in November, delivers production-ready capabilities across the AI portfolio for
  greater enterprise efficiency and scale. The release focuses on delivering speed
  and predictable scale for gen AI applications, primarily through SLA-aware inference
  capabilities. Key features include the generally available llm-d for reliably scaling
  Large Language Models (LLMs) and support for the emerging Model Context Protocol
  (MCP) and Llama Stack API (in Developer/Technical Preview) to accelerate agentic
  AI development. The platform also offers an extensible toolkit for model customization,
  enhanced RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) capabilities, and intelligent GPU-as-a-Service
  (GPUaaS) features for maximizing hardware efficiency across the hybrid cloud.'
