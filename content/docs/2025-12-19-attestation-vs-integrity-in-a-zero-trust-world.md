  Edge computing Infrastructure Applications Virtualization Share The complex risks
  facing modern IT environments make IT security a strategic imperative, not a back-end
  detail. Furthering this is cloud computing, which serves as the foundation of the
  AI economy, meaning that enterprises and nations require greater control, transparency,
  and assurance over data location and protection. Trust has become not just a technical
  question, but a matter of national policy, corporate strategy, and even societal
  resilience. At the same time, the explosion of AI and machine learning (ML) workloads
  is reshaping infrastructure requirements. But these shifts pose a complex question—if
  your most valuable models and datasets are in the cloud, how do you assess their
  security posture? Here lies the central dilemma. The very abstraction that makes
  the cloud powerful also makes it opaque. You don’t control the hardware, the hypervisor,
  or the low-level firmware that your workloads depend on. How do you trust something
  you cannot see or control? The old paradigm of “trust but verify” no longer works
  in this modern environment. Instead, the principle of zero trust, “assume nothing,
  verify everything,” has become a core tenet of modern security strategy. This is
  where the next generation of security concepts comes into play. Confidential computing,
  through hardware-based trusted execution environments (TEEs), enables organizations
  to protect their data not only at rest and in transit, but also in use.'
