tldr: Aqua Security Achieves FedRAMP® High Authorization What Is FedRAMP High and
  Why Does It Matter? Aqua U. S.
summary: 'Aqua Security Achieves FedRAMP® High Authorization What Is FedRAMP High
  and Why Does It Matter? Aqua U. S. Gov: Built for the Public Sector Helping Public
  and Private Organizations Move Forward A More Secure Cloud Native Future Starts
  Here Aqua Security’s Cloud Native Application Protection Platform (CNAPP) has achieved
  FedRAMP® High Impact Authorization, making Aqua one of the few CNAPP providers authorized
  at the highest level of federal cloud security compliance. This milestone opens
  the door for U. S. federal agencies, commercial organizations that require FedRAMP
  High, and cloud service providers operating in FedRAMP-authorized environments to
  confidently use Aqua’s platform for securing their cloud native applications. We
  met more than 400 rigorous security controls, giving federal agencies and commercial
  organizations the peace of mind that they can adopt cloud native technologies while
  meeting the highest security standards. FedRAMP (Federal Risk and Authorization
  Management Program) is a United States government-wide program that standardizes
  security assessments for cloud products and services. FedRAMP High is the most stringent
  level, designed for cloud services that manage highly sensitive data related to
  national security, public health, and other sensitive government functions. Achieving
  this level of authorization involves an extensive review of security controls, practices,
  and monitoring processes. The result: confidence that the platform is built to withstand
  today’s complex cyber threats. However, FedRAMP isn’t just about security; it also
  plays a critical role in compliance.'
