summary: 'Aqua Security’s Cloud Native Application Protection Platform (CNAPP) has
  achieved FedRAMP® High Impact Authorization, making Aqua one of the few CNAPP providers
  authorized at the highest level of federal cloud security compliance. This milestone
  opens the door for U. S. federal agencies, commercial organizations that require
  FedRAMP High, and cloud service providers operating in FedRAMP-authorized environments
  to confidently use Aqua’s platform for securing their cloud native applications.
  We met more than 400 rigorous security controls, giving federal agencies and commercial
  organizations the peace of mind that they can adopt cloud native technologies while
  meeting the highest security standards. FedRAMP (Federal Risk and Authorization
  Management Program) is a United States government-wide program that standardizes
  security assessments for cloud products and services. FedRAMP High is the most stringent
  level, designed for cloud services that manage highly sensitive data related to
  national security, public health, and other sensitive government functions. Achieving
  this level of authorization involves an extensive review of security controls, practices,
  and monitoring processes. The result: confidence that the platform is built to withstand
  today’s complex cyber threats. However, FedRAMP isn’t just about security; it also
  plays a critical role in compliance. It helps agencies meet a wide range of federal
  mandates and executive directives, such as NIST 800-53 standards, Executive Order
  14028 on improving the nation’s cybersecurity, and OMB memoranda like M-22-09. By
  aligning cloud solutions with these policies, FedRAMP High Authorization ensures
  that agencies not only deploy secure technology but also do so in a manner consistent
  with federal oversight and accountability frameworks.'
