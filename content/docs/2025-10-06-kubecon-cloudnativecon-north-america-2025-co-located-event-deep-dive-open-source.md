  has always been about bringing people together to strengthen trust in open source.
  From its beginnings within TAG Security to its growth as a standalone conference,
  and now returning to KubeCon + CloudNativeCon alongside the Open Source Security
  Foundation (OpenSSF) , the event has become a gathering place for anyone passionate
  about securing our shared ecosystem. As a co-located event, it will bring together
  software developers, security engineers, public sector leaders, CISOs, CIOs, and
  technology innovators. Through interactive discussions, expert-led sessions, and
  hands-on activities, participants will dive into emerging security challenges, explore
  the latest industry innovations, and share best practices that are shaping the future
  of secure software development. You don’t need to be a security practitioner to
  attend! This event will have lots of great security content, but it is a place for
  all developers to come and get their security questions answered. Whether you are
  a security engineer, DevOps professional, software developer, cloud architect, IT
  manager, risk and compliance officer, or open source contributor, this event has
  something for you. Join us if you’re an open source contributor or maintainer who
  wants to improve the security of their projects and learn about the landscape of
  open source security. Security is no longer just a consideration. It is a necessity.
  Open Source SecurityCon 2025 is a welcoming space for anyone interested in building
  more secure, scalable software. Even if you’re not an open source developer, the
  ways of securing open source can be applied to any code and development process.
  The best part, all the tools and frameworks that will be showcased are open source.
