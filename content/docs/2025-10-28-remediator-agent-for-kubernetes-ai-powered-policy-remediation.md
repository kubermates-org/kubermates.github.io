  Today Kubernetes gives teams incredible power and flexibility—but it’s also noisy.
  Every day, platform and security teams encounter a flood of policy violations, including
  missing resource limits, insecure container settings, deprecated APIs, and more.
  Fixing them typically means opening a ticket, chasing down the right developer,
  or manually editing manifests—wasting time and increasing mean time to remediate
  (MTTR). What if instead of endless firefighting, your system could spot a violation
  and propose the fix—automatically ? That’s precisely what the Remediator Agent does.
  The Remediator Agent is an AI-powered remediation engine for Kubernetes that integrates
  directly with Kyverno and Nirmata Control Hub (NCH). It bridges the gap between
  policy detection and automated action , helping teams reduce manual work while maintaining
  their clusters’ compliance and security. With Kyverno and NCH, you already get powerful
  policy-as-code and cluster-wide visibility into policy violations. But visibility
  alone doesn’t solve the problem; it just exposes it. Teams kept asking: “Can you
  just fix this for me?” “Can you open the PR so I don’t have to?” “Can we run this
  across multiple clusters without breaking GitOps?” The Remediator Agent answers
  these with AI-assisted remediation that works hand-in-hand with your existing GitOps
  workflows – and most importantly, helps teams dramatically reduce MTTR. Think of
  Remediator as the missing link between detection and action: Watch: The agent continuously
  detects policy violations. Understand: AI interprets the violation, the resource,
  and the policy intent. Propose: It generates a clean diff, the actual lines to change,
  and explains why.'
