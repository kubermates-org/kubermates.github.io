  Cloud Foundation® (VCF), assistance and guidance from a VMware expert at the onset
  of an implementation can help to ensure alignment between your private cloud strategy
  and business goals for your IT environment. VCF Jumpstart Workshop provides visibility
  into your current technology state, ensures alignment with VMware best practices,
  and recommends an adoption plan and architecture unique to your environment and
  business use cases. These workshop is crafted to specifically align to your needs.
  The following are examples of workshop activities that help provide visibility into
  your current technology state, best practices, and recommendations to achieve the
  desired future state. Cloud Maturity Rating – This assessment evaluates your current
  private cloud capabilities and compares them with your desired future state. We
  analyze your cloud environment, prioritize cloud capabilities, and define phases
  and milestones for delivery. Implementation Architecture – Your VMware technology
  is reviewed to ensure that high-level architectural best practices are in place.
  We analyze your current architecture and identify any gaps to reach your future
  state and desired capabilities. We also help you compose a conceptual architecture
  for your cloud operations. Capability Roadmap – Creating an effective adoption plan
  is essential for a smooth transition and implementation of VCF. We document a comprehensive
  roadmap for your private cloud and recommend actionable steps and activities to
  ensure that your cloud strategy is not only well-planned, but actionable and sustainable.'
