  Applications Virtualization Share Developers are accustomed to the cloud, where
  a virtual machine (VM) can be launched in seconds. But in many enterprises, especially
  in regulated industries, requesting and receiving a VM can take a staggering 60
  to 90 days. This kind of delay can stifle innovation and slow down critical projects.
  But what if you could provide your developers with a more seamless, self-service
  experience that delivers a fully configured VM in under an hour, with automated
  lifecycle management? This isn''t a far-off dream, it''s a reality you can build
  with Red Hat''s integrated toolset. To transform a slow and manual process into
  a rapid, automated one, you need 3 key building blocks: A user-friendly portal,
  a powerful hypervisor, and an intelligent automation engine. The portal: Red Hat
  Developer Hub provides a single, streamlined user experience (based on Backstage)
  for requesting any resource, starting with VMs. It''s an enterprise-grade, hardened
  platform with the support complex organizations require. The hypervisor: Red Hat
  OpenShift Virtualization brings traditional VMs and modern containers together on
  a single Kubernetes-based platform. Built on KVM, it allows you to manage your entire
  estate, including legacy Windows and Linux VMs, to cloud-native applications from
  a unified control plane. The automation engine: Red Hat Ansible Automation Platform
  is the orchestration engine that ties everything together. It automates every complex,
  behind-the-scenes task, eliminating manual handoffs that cause delays. Provisioning
  a VM is just the beginning.'
