  inference, and complex data processing—cluster performance and stability are paramount.
  Our new observability features are designed to give you the visibility you need
  to ensure effective utilization of your resources and quickly debug any performance
  bottlenecks. Get real-time, individual metrics from your NVIDIA and AMD GPUs and
  their network interfaces on critical factors like utilization, temperature, power
  consumption, and more—all directly within the DigitalOcean Insights UI, and with
  zero setup required. We’ve grouped the new metrics into five intuitive categories
  to provide a comprehensive view of your GPU and DOKS cluster health and performance:
  Utilization: Understand how busy your GPU cores and memory are. This includes key
  metrics like GPU Occupancy and Memory Utilization, allowing you to optimize your
  setup for peak performance live. Utilization: Understand how busy your GPU cores
  and memory are. This includes key metrics like GPU Occupancy and Memory Utilization,
  allowing you to optimize your setup for peak performance live. Temperature: Monitor
  thermal conditions to prevent overheating and ensure stable operation under heavy
  load. Power: Track power consumption, which is essential for understanding GPU performance
  and efficiency. Throttle: Identify if your GPU is limiting its performance due to
  thermal, power, or voltage constraints. This is crucial for debugging sudden performance
  degradations.'
