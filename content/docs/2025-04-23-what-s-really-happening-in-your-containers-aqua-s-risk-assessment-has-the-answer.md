summary: Containers may be mainstream, but securing them in production remains a moving
  target. As AI adoption scales and environments grow more complex, so too do the
  risks, especially at runtime, where traditional tools struggle to provide meaningful
  visibility. These are not legacy exploits like port scans or brute force attempts.
  Attackers are targeting what happens inside your environment, at runtime, where
  misconfigurations, unexpected behaviors, and subtle anomalies can quietly introduce
  business risk. Yet most security teams are flying blind in production. They have
  tools that check for vulnerabilities before deployment, scan code for secrets, or
  assess infrastructure misconfigurations. What they don’t have is visibility into
  what’s actually happening right now, in the workloads already running in their environment.
  That’s the gap Aqua is closing with the launch of the Container Security Risk Assessment
  (CSRA). Security tooling has largely focused on pre-production controls like image
  scanning, CI/CD pipeline checks, and IaC validation. It is logical, and even easier
  than runtime. But once containers are running, things change. Configurations drift.
