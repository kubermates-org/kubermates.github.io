  Welcome back to the third edition of the “Meet Our Contributors” blog post series
  for APAC. This post features four outstanding contributors from China, who have
  played diverse leadership and community roles in the upstream Kubernetes project.
  So, without further ado, let’s get straight to the article. Andy Zhang currently
  works for Microsoft China at the Shanghai site. His main focus is on Kubernetes
  storage drivers. Andy started contributing to Kubernetes about 5 years ago. He states
  that as he is working in Azure Kubernetes Service team and spends most of his time
  contributing to the Kubernetes community project. Now he is the main contributor
  of quite a lot Kubernetes subprojects such as Kubernetes cloud provider code. His
  open source contributions are mainly self-motivated. In the last two years he has
  mentored a few students contributing to Kubernetes through the LFX Mentorship program,
  some of whom got jobs due to their expertise and contributions on Kubernetes projects.
  Andy is an active member of the China Kubernetes community. He adds that the Kubernetes
  community has a good guide about how to become members, code reviewers, approvers
  and finally when he found out that some open source projects are in the very early
  stage, he actively contributed to those projects and became the project maintainer.'
