  \ At Deploy London 2025, we shared the next chapter of the Gradient AI Platform.\
  \ Weâ\x80\x99re making it easier for developers and businesses to build production-ready\
  \ AI applications, whether youâ\x80\x99re experimenting with your first agent or\
  \ scaling an enterprise workload. Today, in that spirit, weâ\x80\x99re introducing\
  \ a new wave of features that expand what you can build with the Gradient AI Platform,\
  \ give you greater security and control, and accelerate your development workflow.\
  \ AI applications are becoming more multimodal and data-driven, able to work with\
  \ text, images, audio, and other formats. With Image Model Support and Knowledge\
  \ Base Auto-Indexing, these new Gradient AI Platform features make it easier than\
  \ ever to give your agents a wide range of inputs and knowledge sources. You can\
  \ now generate images programmatically using text prompts through Gradient AI Platformâ\x80\
  \x99s Serverless Inference API, powered by OpenAIâ\x80\x99s gpt-image-1 model. This\
  \ is the platformâ\x80\x99s first non-text modality (with more coming soon), expanding\
  \ our capabilities from text-only to include text-to-image generation. Text-to-image\
  \ generation â\x80\x93 Generate images directly via the Serverless Inference API.\
  \ API integration â\x80\x93 Use the existing inference endpoint ( inference. do-ai.\
  \ run/v1/chat/completions ) for image generation. inference."
