  built around how you think and work. That’s why we’re excited to announce that we’ve
  updated our agent evaluations experience in the DigitalOcean Gradient™ AI Platform.
  These improvements make it faster and easier to evaluate your AI agents, understand
  results, and debug issues. The original evaluations feature was powerful but presented
  friction points that made it hard for developers to adopt. This redesign tackles
  those challenges head-on: Goal-oriented metric grouping: Metrics are now organized
  into intuitive, goal-oriented groups such as Safety & Security, Correctness, and
  RAG Performance. The Safety & Security group is preselected to help developers get
  started quickly and confidently. Example datasets : A list of example data sets
  are now available for common evaluations. This allows developers to create their
  own datasets quickly and efficiently. Clear, persistent error messaging : Upload
  errors are now clear, persistent, and specific, with messages like “Validation Error:
  ‘query’ column is missing”. Developers can easily understand and fix issues, reducing
  friction in the testing process. Interpretable results with trace integration :
  Results are organized by the same metric groups used in setup, with tooltips to
  explain each metric and its scoring. Deep integration with observability tools allows
  developers to jump directly from a low score to the full trace for fast debugging
  and improvement.'
