summary: 'On behalf of the Structured Logging Working Group and SIG Instrumentation
  , we are pleased to announce that the contextual logging feature introduced in Kubernetes
  v1. 24 has now been successfully migrated to two components (kube-scheduler and
  kube-controller-manager) as well as some directories. This feature aims to provide
  more useful logs for better troubleshooting of Kubernetes and to empower developers
  to enhance Kubernetes. Contextual logging is based on the go-logr API. The key idea
  is that libraries are passed a logger instance by their caller and use that for
  logging instead of accessing a global logger. The binary decides the logging implementation,
  not the libraries. The go-logr API is designed around structured logging and supports
  attaching additional information to a logger. This enables additional use cases:
  The caller can attach additional information to a logger: When passing this extended
  logger into a function, and the function uses it instead of the global logger, the
  additional information is then included in all log entries, without having to modify
  the code that generates the log entries. This is useful in highly parallel applications
  where it can become hard to identify all log entries for a certain operation, because
  the output from different operations gets interleaved. When running unit tests,
  log output can be associated with the current test. Then, when a test fails, only
  the log output of the failed test gets shown by go test. That output can also be
  more verbose by default because it will not get shown for successful tests.'
