  This marks the fourth edition of Platform Engineering Day, following successful
  events in Paris (2024), Salt Lake City (2024), and London (2025). We’re excited
  to continue exploring case studies and deep technical dives as platform engineering
  practices mature.

  This marks the fourth edition of Platform Engineering Day, following successful
  events in Paris (2024), Salt Lake City (2024), and London (2025). We’re excited
  to continue exploring case studies and deep technical dives as platform engineering
  practices mature. In Atlanta, we’ll continue the expanded two-track format introduced
  in London earlier this year, giving attendees even more opportunities to explore
  topics most relevant to them. This event is really aimed at anyone who is building
  platforms, using platforms or trying to learn more about platform engineering, wherever
  they are on their journey. There will be content from end-user organizations and
  updates from the Platform Engineering Community Group, ensuring something valuable
  for attendees at every level. This year we’re aiming for content that goes deeper
  into the topics of platform maturity and more use cases of lessons that organisations
  have learnt. Expect even more real-world insights from practitioners who are shaping
  the next phase of platform engineering. The day will feature two parallel tracks
  covering topics such as developer experience, API-driven infrastructure, and the
  evolving future of platform engineering. We’ll start and end the day together, giving
  attendees a shared sense of community while still allowing freedom to choose sessions
  that match their interests. No pre-work is needed—just bring your curiosity! We
  have an incredible lineup of speakers who will be happy to answer questions and
  share insights. We can’t wait to see you there—join us for an inspiring day of learning,
  connection, and platform innovation. Share.
