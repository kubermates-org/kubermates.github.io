summary: By Chris Short Kubernetes contributors aren’t people in capes or part of
  some secret society. How to start committing to the GitHub repos that make up the
  project is well documented , yet it remains intimidating for many. A few years ago,
  I spoke at an event and jokingly said, “Kubernetes is just a bunch of APIs and YAML…
  I’m a contributor; you don’t believe me?” After that talk, someone pulled me aside
  and asked if I was the Kubernetes contributor. They wanted to get involved in the
  community. Then came the real question, “I don’t know which special interest group
  (SIG) I would work in. ” The SIG you work in depends on your skills and what you
  want to do with your (or your company’s) free time. I’ll start with myself as an
  example. I do not code as part of my day-to-day work; I never have. While I have
  made bits of code into programs here and there, I always had a helping hand. It’s
  also possible my definition of a coder is busted too. But, I consider myself a non-code
  contributor to Kubernetes. I’m an Ops person that embraced DevOps early.
