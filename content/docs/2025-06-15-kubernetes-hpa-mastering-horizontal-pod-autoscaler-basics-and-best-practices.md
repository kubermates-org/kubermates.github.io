  Do Things Now Still Not Job-Ready After Learning DevOps? What Is Kubernetes? Finally,
  a Simple Explanation! This capability ensures your application remains responsive
  and performs well under varying traffic loads. In this article, we will cover the
  basics of Kubernetes HPA, how it works, best practices, and a hands-on example to
  help you master this critical Kubernetes feature. The Horizontal Pod Autoscaler
  (HPA) automatically adjusts the number of pod replicas in Kubernetes based on CPU
  and memory metrics, ensuring stable application performance under varying loads.
  Proper setup of the Metrics Server is essential, as it provides the necessary resource
  metrics for HPA to make informed scaling decisions; accurate HPA configuration specifies
  minimum and maximum replicas along with target utilization. Integrating HPA with
  other autoscalers such as the Vertical Pod Autoscaler (VPA) and Cluster Autoscaler
  enhances scaling strategies, allowing for efficient resource management and responsiveness
  to varying application demands. At its core, the Kubernetes Horizontal Pod Autoscaler
  (HPA) is a Kubernetes resource that automatically adjusts the number of pod replicas
  based on observed CPU and memory usage metrics. This dynamic adjustment ensures
  your application maintains stable performance even as traffic fluctuates, making
  it a critical component for production workloads. Horizontal pod autoscaling HPA
  operates by continuously monitoring specified metrics and making scaling decisions
  to match the demand. The HPA utilizes resource metrics like CPU and memory, as well
  as custom metrics and cpu metrics, to determine the appropriate number of replicas
  needed. For example, if the average CPU utilization exceeds a predefined threshold,
  HPA will increase the number of replicas to distribute the load. Conversely, when
  the demand decreases, HPA reduces the number of replicas, optimizing resource usage
  and reducing costs. Additionally, the custom metrics api can be leveraged to enhance
  monitoring capabilities.'
