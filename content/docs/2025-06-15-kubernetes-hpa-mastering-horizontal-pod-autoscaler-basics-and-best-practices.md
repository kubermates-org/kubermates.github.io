summary: Kubernetes Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA) automatically adjusts the number
  of pod replicas in your Kubernetes cluster based on CPU or memory usage metrics.
  This capability ensures your application remains responsive and performs well under
  varying traffic loads. In this article, we will cover the basics of Kubernetes HPA,
  how it works, best practices, and a hands-on example to help you master this critical
  Kubernetes feature. At its core, the Kubernetes Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA)
  is a Kubernetes resource that automatically adjusts the number of pod replicas based
  on observed CPU and memory usage metrics. This dynamic adjustment ensures your application
  maintains stable performance even as traffic fluctuates, making it a critical component
  for production workloads. Horizontal pod autoscaling HPA operates by continuously
  monitoring specified metrics and making scaling decisions to match the demand. The
  HPA utilizes resource metrics like CPU and memory, as well as custom metrics and
  cpu metrics, to determine the appropriate number of replicas needed. For example,
  if the average CPU utilization exceeds a predefined threshold, HPA will increase
  the number of replicas to distribute the load. Conversely, when the demand decreases,
  HPA reduces the number of replicas, optimizing resource usage and reducing costs.
  Additionally, the custom metrics api can be leveraged to enhance monitoring capabilities.
  This automatic scaling mechanism helps maintain application performance and reliability
  without manual intervention and automatically scales. Understanding how the Horizontal
  Pod Autoscaler (HPA) operates is crucial for leveraging its full potential.
