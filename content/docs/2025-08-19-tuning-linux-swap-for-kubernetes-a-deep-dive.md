  This article focuses exclusively on tuning swap on Linux nodes, where this feature
  is available. By allowing Linux nodes to use secondary storage for additional virtual
  memory when physical RAM is exhausted, node swap support aims to improve resource
  utilization and reduce out-of-memory (OOM) kills. However, enabling swap is not
  a "turn-key" solution. The performance and stability of your nodes under memory
  pressure are critically dependent on a set of Linux kernel parameters. Misconfiguration
  can lead to performance degradation and interfere with Kubelet''s eviction logic.
  In this blogpost, I''ll dive into critical Linux kernel parameters that govern swap
  behavior. I will explore how these parameters influence Kubernetes workload performance,
  swap utilization, and crucial eviction mechanisms. I will present various test results
  showcasing the impact of different configurations, and share my findings on achieving
  optimal settings for stable and high-performing Kubernetes clusters. At a high level,
  the Linux kernel manages memory through pages, typically 4KiB in size. When physical
  memory becomes constrained, the kernel''s page replacement algorithm decides which
  pages to move to swap space.'
