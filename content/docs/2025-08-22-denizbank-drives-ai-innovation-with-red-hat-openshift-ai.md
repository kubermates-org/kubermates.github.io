  Virtualization Share In the competitive world of modern finance, staying ahead means
  embracing innovation. For DenizBank, one of Türkiye''s leading private banks, this
  means a strong commitment to integrating artificial intelligence (AI) and machine
  learning (ML) into the core of its operations. Driving this technological evolution
  within DenizBank is Intertech, DenizBank''s IT subsidiary, which has played a key
  role in redefining what''s possible in banking. Before this modernization, DenizBank''s
  data science teams faced significant hurdles that hindered their ability to innovate
  quickly. Their workflows were characterized by: Manual and inflexible environments
  : Over 120 data scientists were using a Virtual Desktop Infrastructure (VDI) for
  model development. This VDI-based environment was not only slow and resource-intensive,
  but it also made lifecycle management of continuously changing Python libraries
  incredibly difficult. It forced them to rely on cumbersome digital workstations
  where each new model required a complex, manual setup. A lack of standardization
  : Without a unified platform, consistency was a major issue. Data access methods,
  model environments, database integrations, and code repositories varied from one
  data scientist to another, making collaboration and management difficult. Slow time-to-market
  and deployment : The manual processes created a development bottleneck. It was also
  taking a significant amount of time to decide which model to deploy, as business
  teams struggled to understand and compare which models performed better. This indecision
  meant that critical business opportunities were being missed.'
