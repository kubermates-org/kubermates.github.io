summary: 'Share In the competitive world of modern finance, staying ahead means embracing
  innovation. For DenizBank, one of Türkiye''s leading private banks, this means a
  strong commitment to integrating artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning
  (ML) into the core of its operations. Driving this technological evolution within
  DenizBank is Intertech, DenizBank''s IT subsidiary, which has played a key role
  in redefining what''s possible in banking. Before this modernization, DenizBank''s
  data science teams faced significant hurdles that hindered their ability to innovate
  quickly. Their workflows were characterized by: Intertech recognized that a piecemeal
  approach wouldn''t work. They needed a comprehensive and standardized solution.
  Their goals were clear: improve time-to-market, reduce AI costs, automate the entire
  data science pipeline, and empower their teams with self-service capabilities. The
  foundation was already in place. With over three years of experience running an
  enterprise application platform environment—Red Hat OpenShift—Intertech had a deep
  well of expertise with robust, container-based architectures. The natural next step
  was to adopt Red Hat OpenShift AI. It was chosen for its powerful ability to leverage
  Kubernetes for scalability and its GitOps-friendly, code-based approach to infrastructure.
  Because OpenShift AI is a fully integrated product with OpenShift, the MLOps team
  adopted GitOps practices to manage the entire AI lifecycle, from experiments to
  production models, with full trackability.'
