  Automation Artificial intelligence Open hybrid cloud Security Edge computing Infrastructure
  Applications Virtualization Share Most of us rely on good web metadata every day,
  perhaps hundreds of times a day, without ever realizing it. While we don’t all see
  metadata, it’s present on every webpage, providing details for categorizing content.
  Search and information retrieval software—from content management systems and search
  engines to generative AI (gen AI) chatbots—all depend on metadata to categorize,
  interpret, and display content to users. In some ways, metadata is like the classification
  system librarians use to place books on shelves so that visitors can find them.
  Much like a library catalog, good web metadata makes content easier to find and
  use because it has consistent, meaningful labels. At Red Hat, we maintain dozens
  of websites with tens of thousands of pages and millions of metadata selections.
  To help manage it all, we’ve developed a new internal generative AI (gen AI) tool:
  the Metadata Assistant. Despite our best efforts to stay organized, we struggle
  to make accurate and consistent tags. The overwhelming amount of content to classify
  can feel like a messy, towering pile of books instead of an organized library where
  you can browse the shelves by meaningful categories. Red Hatters must consider more
  than 150 taxonomy choices across several parent categories, like products, topics,
  industries, regions, and partners when classifying their content. Our product portfolio
  is complex, with products frequently being added, discontinued, or renamed. Metadata
  best practices can be tricky for teams to keep up with.'
