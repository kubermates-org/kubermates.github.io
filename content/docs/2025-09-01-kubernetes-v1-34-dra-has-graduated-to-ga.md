summary: 'Kubernetes v1.34: DRA has graduated to GA The core of DRA is now GA Features
  promoted to beta New alpha features What’s next? Getting involved Acknowledgments
  Kubernetes 1.34 is here, and it has brought a huge wave of enhancements for Dynamic
  Resource Allocation (DRA)! This release marks a major milestone with many APIs in
  the resource. k8s. io group graduating to General Availability (GA), unlocking the
  full potential of how you manage devices on Kubernetes. On top of that, several
  key features have moved to beta, and a fresh batch of new alpha features promise
  even more expressiveness and flexibility. resource. k8s. io Let''s dive into what''s
  new for DRA in Kubernetes 1.34! The headline feature of the v1.34 release is that
  the core of DRA has graduated to General Availability. Kubernetes Dynamic Resource
  Allocation (DRA) provides a flexible framework for managing specialized hardware
  and infrastructure resources, such as GPUs or FPGAs. DRA provides APIs that enable
  each workload to specify the properties of the devices it needs, but leaving it
  to the scheduler to allocate actual devices, allowing increased reliability and
  improved utilization of expensive hardware. With the graduation to GA, DRA is stable
  and will be part of Kubernetes for the long run. The community can still expect
  a steady stream of new features being added to DRA over the next several Kubernetes
  releases, but they will not make any breaking changes to DRA. So users and developers
  of DRA drivers can start adopting DRA with confidence.'
