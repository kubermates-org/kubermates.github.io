  Why It Matters We’re excited to announce a refreshed Teams Dashboard in Nirmata
  Control Hub. This redesign delivers a cleaner, more intuitive interface that not
  only looks better, it works better too. Whether you’re managing a few teams or dozens,
  the new dashboard streamlines how you view and interact with team-related data across
  your Kubernetes and cloud environments. To improve visibility and team-level accountability,
  the dashboard now shows how infrastructure resources are allocated across teams.
  You can easily see which Kubernetes clusters, namespaces, and repositories belong
  to each team – such as Security, Platform, or Development – and who the team members
  are. This makes it simpler to understand team footprints, manage access, and align
  infrastructure usage with organizational structure. Team cards have been completely
  redesigned with a cleaner layout that makes key information immediately visible.
  Each card now includes: Total Members in the team Total Clusters assigned Total
  Namespaces assigned Total Repositories assigned This update gives you a high-level
  snapshot of your teams’ footprint across your infrastructure , helping you stay
  informed at a glance. We’ve improved how policy report assignments are surfaced
  on each team card, offering better visibility and preparing the groundwork for even
  more powerful insights and statistics in future releases. Instead of listing all
  teams on one long scroll, we now paginate the dashboard. You’ll see 12 teams at
  a time, making navigation faster and more manageable, especially for larger organizations.
  We’ve also made significant improvements to the Team Details page, focusing on clarity
  and ease of use.'
