  organizations scale Kubernetes and hybrid infrastructures, many are realizing that
  more tools don’t mean better security. A recent Microsoft report found that organizations
  with 16+ point solutions see 2. 8x more data security incidents than those with
  fewer tools. Yet platform teams are still expected to deliver resilience and performance
  across containers, VMs, and bare metal, often while juggling fragmented tools that
  introduce risk, downtime, and complexity. The Fall 2025 release of Calico Enterprise
  and Calico Cloud cuts through that complexity. Its new features are designed to
  make your infrastructure more resilient, performant, and observable—right out of
  the box. From disaster recovery automation to modern data plane support and application
  traffic handling, these updates empower platform engineers to simplify operations
  while meeting strict reliability requirements. 1. Resilient, High-Performance Networking
  and Improved Quality of Service : High availability (HA) management planes for VM
  and bare metal hosts – Increases resiliency and helps reduce downtime. The official
  release (GA) of the nftables dataplane -Delivers faster and more scalable rule-processing
  than iptables. Maglev-Based Session Affinity – Maintain stable network traffic flow
  during failures or scaling. High availability (HA) management planes for VM and
  bare metal hosts – Increases resiliency and helps reduce downtime.'
