  While students seek skills that inspire innovation and leadership, it''s the educator
  who specializes in making the transformation possible. A great educator acts as
  a dedicated mentor, and doesn''t just teach theoretical concepts but actively unlocks
  potential in the next generation. The path to IT leadership is rarely linear, especially
  when traditional academic curriculum struggles to maintain pace with rapidly evolving
  industry practices. A significant gap often exists between classroom knowledge and
  practical skills employers demand, meaning many graduates lack exposure to the enterprise-grade
  tools used by real companies. Employers have made their priority clear: They need
  practical, certified skills over purely theoretical knowledge. Red Hat Academy is
  a no-cost academic partnership program that Red Hat offers educational institutions
  (like universities and colleges) and turns them into authorized centers for delivering
  Red Hat''s enterprise-ready curriculum for students, focusing on the latest enterprise
  open-source technologies, including Red Hat Enterprise Linux administration, artificial
  intelligence, cloud computing, automation, and application development. Educators
  can easily integrate these industry-ready courses as part of their official or supplemental
  curriculum plan so students can gain access to the same open-source technologies
  utilized by major corporations worldwide. The content is delivered through a dedicated,
  web-based platform where instructors create and manage virtual classes and enroll
  students to access materials, free cloud labs for hands-on activities. Students
  also receive digital Credly badges and industry-recognized certificates when they
  complete a course or certification, respectively. Bridging the skill gap between
  industry and academia requires strong partnerships that enable instructors to bring
  industry standards directly into the classroom. This is where educators can leverage
  Red Hat Academy to transform their teaching environment.'
