  From complex large language models (LLMs) to intricate scientific simulations, developers
  and businesses need access to the most powerful and efficient computing infrastructure.
  At DigitalOcean, we’re committed to providing the cutting-edge tools you need to
  build, deploy, and scale your AI initiatives with simplicity and affordability.
  That’s why we’re excited to announce that GPU Droplets accelerated by NVIDIA HGX™
  B300 are coming soon to DigitalOcean, marking a significant upgrade to our GPU offerings.
  The NVIDIA Blackwell Ultra accelerated computing platform represents a leap forward
  in AI reasoning. Designed for both training and inference, the NVIDIA HGX B300 offers
  substantial improvements in computational power, memory bandwidth, and energy efficiency
  compared to previous generations. The NVIDIA Blackwell architecture at the heart
  of the HGX B300 is not just about raw power; it’s also about efficiency and innovation.
  With 1. 5X more dense Tensor Core FLOPS, enhanced attention performance, and significantly
  expanded memory, the HGX B300 is optimized for the most demanding AI workloads including
  generative AI, data analytics, and high-performance computing (HPC). Featuring 7X
  more AI compute than NVIDIA Hopper platforms, 2. 1TB of HBM3e memory, and high-performance
  networking integration with NVIDIA ConnectX-8 SuperNICs, Blackwell Ultra delivers
  breakthrough performance on the most complex workloads from agentic systems and
  reasoning, to real-time video generation. Developers will find that fine-tuning
  LLMs, running complex simulations, or processing massive multimedia datasets becomes
  more efficient with Blackwell Ultra.'
