  Governance Challenge What is AI-Driven Governance? Why Care? Why Now The Nirmata
  Value Looking Ahead Over the past decade, cloud-native technologies and Kubernetes
  have become the foundation for how enterprises build and run software. At the same
  time, artificial intelligence (AI) has catapulted from experimentation to mainstream
  adoption. This convergence is reshaping not only how applications are created but
  also how they are implemented, secured, and governed. As the creators of Kyverno
  , the leading open-source policy-as-code engine for Kubernetes, we’ve seen firsthand
  how organizations use policies to define intent, enforce standards, and manage risk.
  Kyverno excels at surfacing issues and helping teams understand where their guardrails
  may be failing. But detection alone isn’t enough. Teams are still left with the
  burden of figuring out how to remediate issues, apply fixes across environments,
  and maintain compliance at scale. This is why platform engineering has become both
  the bottleneck and the enabler of the AI future. Without scalable governance and
  guardrails, platform engineering slows down innovation. But with AI-driven governance
  and automated policy enforcement , platform engineering becomes the discipline that
  unlocks velocity, resilience, and trust—creating the foundation AI needs to thrive.
  The question is no longer IF we need governance, but how we can establish effective
  guardrails, controls, and compliance without slowing down innovation. That’s where
  AI-driven governance comes in.'
