  Virtualization Share For years, my career in cybersecurity was defined by a sense
  of urgency and criticality. As a leader of incident response teams, I lived on the
  front lines, constantly reacting to the latest software vulnerabilities, cyberattacks,
  and anomalies. My days were a blur of alerts, patch deployments, and the relentless
  pressure to mitigate risk and restore operations. It was a challenging, high-stakes
  environment where every vulnerability felt like a direct threat. Now, I''ve traded
  the immediate firefight for a more proactive battlefield as a manager within Red
  Hat Product Security. This has given me a unique perspective—shifting from addressing
  vulnerabilities after they occur to understanding how they''re managed from the
  ground up. What I’ve discovered here isn''t just a process, it’s a philosophy that
  resonates deeply with my past experiences and offers a refreshing approach to security
  in the open source world.'
