tldr: Introduction Featured Talks Kubeflow Booth Highlights Our experience Want to
  help? KubeCon + CloudNativeCon India 2025 in Hyderabad was an absolute blast! As
  a second-time attendee ( Akash Jaiswal ) and a first-time attendee ( Yash Pal ),
  we couldnâ€™t help but be blown away by the incredible energy at one of worldâ€™s biggest
  cloud native gatherings. We were super excited seeing Kubeflow get a special shoutout
  during the opening keynote for its role in cloud native AI/ML and MLOps - definitely
  made us proud to be part of the community! (Above image shows the keynote moment)
  We also got super lucky with the chance to volunteer at the Kubeflow booth this
  year.

  As a second-time attendee ( Akash Jaiswal ) and a first-time attendee ( Yash Pal
  ), we couldnâ€™t help but be blown away by the incredible energy at one of worldâ€™s
  biggest cloud native gatherings. We were super excited seeing Kubeflow get a special
  shoutout during the opening keynote for its role in cloud native AI/ML and MLOps
  - definitely made us proud to be part of the community! (Above image shows the keynote
  moment) We also got super lucky with the chance to volunteer at the Kubeflow booth
  this year. We also met Johnu George in person, who delivered two amazing talks on
  Kubeflowâ€™s latest capabilities. It was really exciting to finally meet community
  members face-to-face whom weâ€™ve only seen in community calls and Slack! This blog
  shares all the exciting bits from our packed 2 days at KubeCon - from awesome booth
  conversations to technical deep-dives. We hope this motivates more community members
  to not just contribute but also attend and help Kubeflow at events like KubeCon.

  team. It was really great to meet and interact with audiences who had dozens of
  questions about Kubeflow, contributors who wanted to help, and developers who were
  already using it and shared their experiences. Here are some key highlights from
  our booth conversations: Community Engagement: Discussions on real-world use cases
  and deployment strategies. Few users shared their experience of using Kubeflow in
  their companies and how its benefiting them. Many of the audience wants to learn
  more about how to explore and contribute to Kubeflow. (Answers: Join community calls,
  and check out GitHub for open issues) Several companies expressed interest in adopting
  projects like Kubeflow. Few senior engineers were already using it for some of their
  workloads, now they want to use it for production workload.'
