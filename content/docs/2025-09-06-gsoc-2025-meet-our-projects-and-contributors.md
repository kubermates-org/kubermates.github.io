  has been an exciting journey for the Kubeflow community! We are very grateful for
  Google and the open source community members dedication and effort. 🎉 This year,
  9 contributors from around the world collaborated with mentors to improve different
  parts of the Kubeflow ecosystem — from infrastructure and CI/CD, to notebooks, ML
  workflows, and beyond. In this blog, we are highlighting all the projects that were
  part of GSoC 2025 , their goals, the impact they’ve created, and the amazing contributors
  behind them. 👉 You can explore the full list on our GSoC 2025 page. Below are the
  projects from this year’s GSoC. Each section includes a short summary, contributor
  details, and links to project resources. Contributor: Harshvir Potpose ( @akagami-harsh
  ) Mentors: Julius von Kohout ( @juliusvonkohout ) Overview: We need an up to date
  S3 storage with hard multi-tenancy and run our containers with PodSecurityStandards
  restricted. MinIO transitioned to the AGPLv3 license in 2021, creating significant
  compliance challenges for the project. This project addressed this critical blocker
  by implementing SeaweedFS as a production-ready replacement for MinIO. SeaweedFS
  offers a more permissive Apache 2.0 license while providing superior performance
  characteristics and enterprise-grade security and reliability. Key Outcomes: Provided
  S3 storage with hard multi-tenancy Successfully migrated to SeaweedFS as a secure
  replacement for MinIO and integrated it into Kubeflow Pipelines Eliminated MinIO’s
  licensing constraints by adopting SeaweedFS’s more permissive license model Implemented
  comprehensive CI tests for SeaweedFS deployment and namespace isolation functionality
  Strengthened the manifests repository’s CI pipeline and contributed to the dashboard
  migration efforts Enforcing PodSecurityStandards baseline/restricted Resources:

  (GitHub: @LogicalGuy77 ) Mentors: Griffin Sullivan ( @Griffin-Sullivan ), Julius
  von Kohout ( @juliusvonkohout ) Overview: This project revived and modernized the
  KServe Models Web Application (Angular + Flask), the UI used to manage machine learning
  inference services in Kubeflow via KServe. What began as a small Node.'
