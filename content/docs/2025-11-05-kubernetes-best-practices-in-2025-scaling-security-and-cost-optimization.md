  The challenge isn’t adoption - it’s optimization and security. Clusters are larger,
  faster, and business-critical than ever. Scale Smarter, Not Just Bigger Combine
  HPA, VPA, and Cluster Autoscaler for data-driven scaling. Use resource quotas to
  keep teams fair and costs predictable. Practice live with KodeKloud scaling labs
  and dashboards. Secure by Design Apply RBAC , Pod Security Standards , and Network
  Policies. Scan and sign container images with Trivy and Cosign.'
