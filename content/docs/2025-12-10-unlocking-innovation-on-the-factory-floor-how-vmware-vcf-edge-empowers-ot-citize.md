  the GitOps Barrier: Continuous Delivery for Modern Apps with VCF 9 The push for
  application modernization isn’t just an IT department concern anymore—it’s a fundamental
  requirement for the modern Operational Technology (OT) environment. Factory floors,
  energy grids, and logistics hubs are brimming with opportunities for improvement,
  and the people who know these processes best are your OT experts: the factory workers,
  engineers, and floor supervisors. They have the knowledge and motivation to optimize
  their daily operations. The problem? Traditional, complex IT infrastructure has
  been a towering obstacle to getting their ideas off the ground. For years, operational
  staff have sought ways to digitize and improve their workflows, often turning to
  low-code development tools like Node-RED to quickly build applications. These tools
  are fantastic for rapid prototyping and connecting industrial systems, but they
  still run into challenges when it comes to deployment, security, and enterprise
  scale. The primary obstacles for these citizen developers include the following.
  Complexity of Deployment: Setting up robust, secure, and scalable environments (like
  Kubernetes clusters or virtual machines) is a full-time IT job, not an OT one. Lack
  of Unified Support: OT and IT platforms often live in silos, leading to fragmented
  security, inconsistent management, and painful handoffs. Security and Robustness:
  A quickly deployed application must run on a secure, reliable foundation that meets
  industrial uptime and regulatory standards. This is where VMware Cloud Foundation
  (VCF) Edge completely changes the game. VCF Edge is designed to bring the robustness
  and management simplicity of the core data center right to your remote or edge sites—whether
  that’s a factory floor, a retail branch, or a substation.'
