summary: 'Every modern enterprise strives for faster software delivery without compromising
  on security and compliance. As cloud-native environments grow in scale and complexity,
  so does the burden of identifying and fixing misconfigurations across clusters,
  pipelines, and cloud infrastructure. Today, we’re excited to announce a major leap
  forward in our mission to simplify cloud governance: AI-Powered Remediations , which
  is now available in preview in Nirmata Control Hub (NCH). Security and platform
  teams often face a growing backlog of policy violations—from missing labels to insecure
  container configurations to overly permissive network rules. Manually investigating
  each violation, understanding its root cause, and crafting a compliant fix takes
  time—and that time adds up. With AI Remediations, we’re dramatically reducing the
  Mean Time to Remediation (MTTR ). Instead of spending hours chasing down documentation
  or writing YAML from scratch, teams can now review and apply context-aware fixes
  in minutes. And the benefits go beyond speed: Whether it’s a Deployment, ConfigMap,
  NetworkPolicy, or any Kubernetes resource, if it violates a rule enforced by your
  Kyverno policies in NCH, we can generate a fix. Here’s how: Transparency by design:
  We don’t just tell you what to change – we explain why. You stay in control, with
  the ability to test and validate before deployment. AI Remediations aren’t about
  removing humans from the loop—they’re about giving your teams a smarter starting
  point. Think of them as policy-aware code suggestions that plug right into your
  existing workflows.'
