summary: 'Nirmata’s AI-Powered Remediations: A Smarter Way to Fix Policy Violations
  Why AI Remediations for Policy as Code? How It Works Designed for Developer Velocity
  and Platform Efficiency Where to Find It What’s Next Every modern enterprise strives
  for faster software delivery without compromising on security and compliance. As
  cloud-native environments grow in scale and complexity, so does the burden of identifying
  and fixing misconfigurations across clusters, pipelines, and cloud infrastructure.
  Today, we’re excited to announce a major leap forward in our mission to simplify
  cloud governance: AI-Powered Remediations , which is now available in preview in
  Nirmata Control Hub (NCH). Security and platform teams often face a growing backlog
  of policy violations—from missing labels to insecure container configurations to
  overly permissive network rules. Manually investigating each violation, understanding
  its root cause, and crafting a compliant fix takes time—and that time adds up. With
  AI Remediations, we’re dramatically reducing the Mean Time to Remediation (MTTR
  ). Instead of spending hours chasing down documentation or writing YAML from scratch,
  teams can now review and apply context-aware fixes in minutes. And the benefits
  go beyond speed: Dev teams are no longer blocked by vague policy errors. Instead,
  they receive concrete, explainable suggestions to fix issues early. Platform engineers
  can spend less time triaging violations and more time building scalable, reliable
  infrastructure. Security teams have peace of mind knowing issues aren’t just detected—they’re
  getting resolved faster than ever. Whether it’s a Deployment, ConfigMap, NetworkPolicy,
  or any Kubernetes resource, if it violates a rule enforced by your Kyverno policies
  in NCH, we can generate a fix.'
