  Jenkins X 2.
summary: Project ideas for Google Summer of Code 2023 ☀️ 1. CD events integration
  with Jenkins X 2. Implement drift detection (gitops) 3. RBAC (Role Based Access
  Control) in Jenkins X UI 4. Simplifying Jenkins X pipeline syntax 5. Multi-tenancy
  in Jenkins X Next Steps We have put together some project ideas as part of our application
  to participate in the Google Summer of Code 2023 program. The cdEvents project standardises
  the way systems talk to each other, which enables Interoperability between systems
  so they speak a common language through the cdEvents spec in the event. Creating
  a capability in Jenkins X that can receive and sent a cdEvent would benefit the
  project and the DevOps ecosystem in general, by stopping glue code used to integrate
  systems and power innovation by letting end users swap out tools with no effort.
  Ability to receive cdEvents Ability to parse cdEvents so Jenkins X understands them
  Ability to send cdEvents Jenkins X, Kubernetes, golang, cdEvents Brad McCoy https://cloudevents.
