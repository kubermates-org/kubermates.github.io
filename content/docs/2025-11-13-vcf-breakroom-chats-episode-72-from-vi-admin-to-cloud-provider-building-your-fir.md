  9 Virtual Private Clouds Welcome to another exciting episode of the VCF Breakroom
  Chats! In this latest video feature, we’re joined once again by Vincent Riccio,
  Product Marketing Engineer for the VCF Division at Broadcom, alongside Alina Thylander.
  This time, they explore how VI Admins can take the leap into becoming Cloud Providers
  by building their first self-service catalog with VCF 9.0. Together, they unpack
  how automation transforms the developer experience—moving away from slow, ticket-driven
  provisioning to on-demand access where VMs, Kubernetes clusters, and even GPU nodes
  can be spun up in minutes. You’ll hear how organizations are reporting dramatic
  reductions in ticket volume, faster release cycles, and reclaimed engineering hours
  that fuel innovation. Vincent and Alina also dive into why supporting UI, CLI, and
  API is critical for private cloud adoption, showing how VCF 9.0 empowers both low-code
  users and cloud-native DevOps teams from a single platform. The conversation continues
  with a demo of publishing blueprints into the self-service catalog and provisioning
  them through both the portal and declarative API, before wrapping up with strategies
  for designing safety guardrails—ensuring broad self-service access without compromising
  capacity, cost, or compliance. Don’t miss this practical and inspiring discussion
  on how VCF 9.0 helps you evolve from VI Admin to Cloud Provider while delivering
  secure, efficient, and flexible cloud services. Want to learn more about VCF Automation?
