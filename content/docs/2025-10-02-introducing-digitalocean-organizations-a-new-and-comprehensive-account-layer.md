  \ Ghalwash Published: October 2, 2025 3 min read Weâ\x80\x99re excited to announce\
  \ a powerful, new top-level account layer designed to bring all your teams together\
  \ under one cohesive structure. This new account layerâ\x80\x94we call it Organizationsâ\x80\
  \x94is perfect for teams that need scalable structure without the massive, complex\
  \ overhead of traditional enterprise cloud providers. Organizations was built to\
  \ simplify account management for DigitalOcean customers who manage multiple teams\
  \ and users. Weâ\x80\x99ve heard from our growing customers, agencies, partners,\
  \ and enterprises that managing multiple teams, separate bills, and fragmented user\
  \ access is a pain. With this new organization layer, you can better organize your\
  \ teamâ\x80\x99s access even as you scale up. Before today, every Team on DigitalOcean\
  \ was treated as its own separate account. If you managed five different clients,\
  \ five different projects, or five internal departments, that meant five separate\
  \ bills, five different places to manage user access, and a fragmented view of your\
  \ overall cloud presence. Our new account layer closes this gap by allowing you\
  \ to consolidate multiple teams under one Organization, providing the centralized\
  \ control and simplified operations needed by growing enterprises. By unifying your\
  \ entire DigitalOcean presence into a single group, so you can streamline operations,\
  \ gain more financial control, and build a cohesive environment that scales seamlessly."
