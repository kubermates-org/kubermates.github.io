  models (LLMs) is a significant undertaking, but a more pervasive and often overlooked
  cost challenge is AI inference. Inference is the procedure by which a trained AI
  model processes new input data and generates an output. As organizations deploy
  these models in production, the costs can quickly become substantial, especially
  with high token volumes, long prompts, and growing usage demands. To run LLMs in
  a cost-effective and high-performing way, a comprehensive strategy is essential.
  This approach addresses two critical areas: optimizing the inference runtime and
  optimizing the model itself. Basic serving methods often struggle with inefficient
  GPU memory usage, suboptimal batch processing, and slow token generation. This is
  where a high-performance inference runtime becomes critical. vLLM, is the de facto,
  open source library that helps LLMs perform calculations more efficiently and at
  scale. vLLM addresses these runtime challenges with advanced techniques, including:
  Continuous batching : Instead of processing requests one by one, vLLM groups tokens
  from multiple sequences into batches. This minimizes GPU idle time and significantly
  improves GPU utilization and inference throughput. PagedAttention : This memory
  management strategy efficiently handles large key-value (KV) caches. By dynamically
  allocating and managing GPU memory pages, PagedAttention greatly increases the number
  of concurrent requests and supports longer sequences without memory bottlenecks.'
