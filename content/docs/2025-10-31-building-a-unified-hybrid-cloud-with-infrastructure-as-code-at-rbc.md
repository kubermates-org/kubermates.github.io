  of Canada Managing infrastructure across a hybrid cloud environment—spanning public
  platforms and private data centers—presents a major challenge. Organizations must
  balance compliance, cost control, and developer experience while delivering consistency
  at scale. At RBC, we addressed this by building a secure and scalable Infrastructure
  as Code (IaC) strategy tailored for hybrid environments. Our ambition extends beyond
  being a leading financial institution—we’re developing the internal capabilities,
  engineering practices, and developer platforms to operate like a modern technology
  company. To deliver a consistent infrastructure experience, RBC embraced three guiding
  principles: compliance, cost management, and developer convenience. Security and
  regulatory requirements were prioritized, cloud spending was closely monitored and
  optimized, and developer productivity was enhanced by making infrastructure management
  seamless. A centralized IaC platform enabled uniform workflows. By deploying execution
  agents within each cloud or on-premises zone, deployments became faster, localized,
  and more secure—keeping sensitive data within appropriate boundaries. This was a
  foundational step in our broader transformation: elevating infrastructure as a first-class
  product and treating platform engineering as a core competency, not a support function.
  It’s how we’re enabling RBC to scale, while preserving the security and trust expected
  of a global financial institution. Operating in a regulated industry means security
  is non-negotiable. RBC embedded policy-as-code into every stage of the infrastructure
  lifecycle.'
