  Private Cloud Subnets VMware Cloud Foundation is the Gold Standard for Virtual Desktop
  Infrastructure In the evolving landscape of application deployment, containerization
  with Kubernetes (K8s) has become the new standard. As organizations adopt Kubernetes
  at scale, public image registries often create challenges, from rate limits to escalating
  costs and limited control over sensitive data. Harbor bridges this gap as an open-source,
  enterprise-grade container registry that brings security, performance, and sovereignty
  to container image management. It seamlessly integrates with existing operational
  paradigms, providing a robust solution for modern container image management needs.
  Originally developed by VMware by Broadcom in 2014 and open-sourced in 2016, Harbor
  joined the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) on July 31, 2018, and graduated
  on June 15, 2020, as its eleventh project – a milestone that reflects both its maturity
  and its vibrant community. Today, Harbor remains one of the most widely adopted
  CNCF projects for secure image management across hybrid and private cloud environments.
  Its active community drives continuous innovation, each release adds new integrations,
  security features, and performance improvements, ensuring Harbor evolves alongside
  enterprise cloud-native needs as a container registry. Recent highlights include:
  ​​v2.13: Integration with CloudNativeAI (CNAI) for AI model management, extended
  audit logging and enhanced OIDC with PKCE support v2.12: Integration with ACR and
  ACR EE Registry v2.11: Native SBOM generation and management At its core, Harbor
  provides a centralized repository for managing container images. Think of it as
  a private, feature-rich registry for your organization, with robust security and
  management features built-in. Key features include: Security: Image vulnerability
  scanning, content trust, and role-based access control. Replication: Replicate images
  across multiple Harbor instances for disaster recovery and content distribution.
  Management: A user-friendly UI for managing projects, users, and images.'
