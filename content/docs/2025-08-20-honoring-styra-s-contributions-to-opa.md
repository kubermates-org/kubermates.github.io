summary: Honoring Styra’s Contributions To OPA As the creator of Open Policy Agent
  (OPA), Styra has played an extraordinary role in shaping the Policy as Code (PaC)
  movement and advancing cloud-native security and governance. This week, the founders
  and core team behind Styra announced that they are joining Apple. I first met the
  Styra team at KubeCon 2017 in Austin, when Brian Grant saw an early demo of what
  we were building, and suggested that I talk to them. Although we have significantly
  different approaches to PaC, one of my favorite moments at each KubeCon since has
  been catching up with folks from Styra and exchanging notes on the space. We here
  at Nirmata, want to take a moment to recognize and thank the entire Styra team –
  their founders Teemu, Tim, Torin, along with Anders, Charlie and many others – for
  their pioneering work. Without their vision and drive, there would be no PaC ecosystem
  as we know it today. At Nirmata, we know that Kyverno’s journey, and our own, would
  not have been possible without the foundation laid by the OPA community. The early
  adoption of OPA proved the need for declarative policies and automated governance.
  It set the standard for how organizations think about declarative policies across
  cloud and infrastructure environments and it will continue to play an important
  role in the CNCF landscape. We are also encouraged that the Styra team has found
  a great home at Apple. With such a strong technology leader supporting them, the
  OPA community can look forward to ongoing innovation, stability, and new opportunities
  for growth. We are excited to see what comes next in the OPA roadmap and how the
  project continues to evolve as a critical part of the cloud native landscape.
