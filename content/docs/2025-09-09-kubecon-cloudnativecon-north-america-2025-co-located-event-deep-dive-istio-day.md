  CNCF projects highlighted in this post November 10, 2025 Atlanta, Georgia Istio
  Day is the biannual community event for the industry’s most widely adopted and feature
  rich service mesh, where attendees will find lessons learned from running Istio
  in production, the latest updates on Istio’s ambient mode developments, and the
  opportunity to meet and learn from maintainers across the Istio ecosystem. This
  will be the fourth Istio Day. The first Istio Day was co-located with KubeCon Europe
  2023, in Amsterdam. This colocated event replaces ServiceMeshCon, which was first
  held in 2019, before Istio was a CNCF project. Everyone from newcomers to seasoned
  professionals will benefit from this event. Whether you’re just starting with Istio
  or have extensive experience, you’ll gain new insights, discover emerging trends,
  and have the opportunity to engage directly with industry experts and fellow practitioners.
  This year, we’ve curated a selection of topics that provide fresh and diverse perspectives
  on Istio. The event features new voices, emerging technologies, and real-world use
  cases that reflect the latest industry trends, offering attendees valuable insights
  they won’t find elsewhere. The event will begin with a welcome from the chairs,
  followed by a series of technical sessions covering various aspects of Istio, including
  case studies, new features, and practical recipes. Throughout the event, there will
  be dedicated breaks for coffee and networking, giving attendees the chance to connect
  with speakers and fellow practitioners. The event will conclude with closing remarks
  summarizing key takeaways. Attendees are encouraged to familiarize themselves with
  the basics of Istio and review the schedule to identify sessions of interest.'
