summary: 'The Policy-as-Code AI Agent: Smarter Kubernetes Governance & Security What
  is the Policy-as-Code Agent? Why the Policy-as-Code Agent Matters Your Personal
  Policy Assistant Key Outcomes Why Now Try the Policy-as-Code Agent Today Policies
  are the backbone of Kubernetes governance. They enforce security, compliance, and
  operational best practices. However, for most teams, policy authoring feels like
  a source of friction: endless YAML, fragmented documentation, and excessive trial-and-error.
  The Policy-as-Code (PaC) Agent changes that. Instead of wrestling with syntax, you
  describe your intent in plain English. The agent generates the right Kyverno policies,
  scaffolds matching test cases, and even prepares Git-ready outputs. It’s not about
  writing YAML faster – it’s about making governance effortless, scalable, and developer-friendly.
  The PaC Agent is an AI-powered assistant for authoring and governing Kubernetes
  policies. It helps teams translate natural language intent into validated, testable
  Kyverno policies , bridging the gap between developer velocity and security rigor.
  With the PaC Agent, anyone — from developers to platform engineers — can create,
  test, and package policies with confidence. Policies aren’t just a compliance exercise;
  they directly shape the developer experience. When governance is slow or inconsistent,
  it creates bottlenecks in the system.'
