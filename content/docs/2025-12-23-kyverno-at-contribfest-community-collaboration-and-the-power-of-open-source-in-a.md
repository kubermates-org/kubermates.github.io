tldr: Why ContribFest matters for open source Sharing the Kyverno story Three groups,
  three journeys Learning together, across experience levels Community, sustainability,
  and the role of supporting organizations Looking ahead to Europe Posted on December

  CNCF projects highlighted in this post A few weeks ago at KubeCon + CloudNativeCon
  North America in Atlanta, the Kyverno community had the opportunity to participate
  in ContribFest , one of the most energizing and community-driven initiatives in
  the cloud-native ecosystem. While ContribFest sessions are listed on the official
  event calendar, many people across the broader community still don’t realize these
  experiences exist—let alone understand how impactful they can be for networking,
  learning, and truly “finding your place” within open source.

  North America in Atlanta, the Kyverno community had the opportunity to participate
  in ContribFest , one of the most energizing and community-driven initiatives in
  the cloud-native ecosystem. While ContribFest sessions are listed on the official
  event calendar, many people across the broader community still don’t realize these
  experiences exist—let alone understand how impactful they can be for networking,
  learning, and truly “finding your place” within open source. Kyverno has been a
  longtime host of ContribFest at KubeCon, and our Atlanta event proved to be one
  for the books with 60+ participants joining in the fun. ContribFest is one of the
  many initiatives supported by the CNCF that reflects what makes open source truly
  special: shared learning, collaboration across company lines, and a welcoming on-ramp
  for people at every stage of their cloud-native journey. As a project, Kyverno strongly
  believes in these types of programs, not only because they help grow individual
  projects, but because they also strengthen the entire cloud-native ecosystem. Open
  source thrives when people with different backgrounds, goals, and experience levels
  come together. ContribFest events create the perfect environment for this to happen
  in a way that is both inclusive and deeply practical. At our Kyverno ContribFest
  event, we welcomed a wide range of participants, including: People new to open source
  who wanted to understand how projects function behind the scenes and learn to contribute
  to the community Practitioners exploring Policy as Code and evaluating Kyverno for
  future adoption Current end users refining their existing implementations and hoping
  to learn more advanced ways to deepen and optimize their setups Long-time community
  members and advanced adopters building complex, production-grade workflows excited
  to contribute to the roadmap and meet other community members for collaboration
  and learning opportunities The result of this mixture of folks coming together is
  always the same: an experience that is enriching for everyone involved! Newcomers
  gain confidence, experienced users deepen their understanding and find ways to give
  back, and maintainers walk away seeing their work being appreciated, valued, and
  with a renewed energy for growth and innovation based on the invaluable feedback
  received from real-world environments and end users. We kicked off the session with
  a brief project overview to ensure everyone, regardless of background, had a shared
  foundation. We introduced: The Kyverno maintainer team and how we collaborate How
  the project is organized and governed Where the repository lives and how the codebase
  is structured The many ways people can contribute beyond writing code How to connect
  with the Kyverno community and participate in discussions This framing helped demystify
  open source, especially since it was the first time seeing what actually happens
  “on the inside” of a CNCF project for many attendees. After the introduction, we
  split the room into three focused discussion groups based on experience level and
  use case. This group explored the fundamentals of Policy as Code and Kyverno adoption.'
