  Share In their most advanced form, AI agents are autonomous systems designed to
  perceive their environment, make decisions, and take actions to achieve specific
  goals. As AI technology evolves, agents are becoming pervasive across many industries
  like finance, healthcare, manufacturing, and customer service. However, not all
  AI agents are created equal—their capabilities vary widely in terms of autonomy,
  decision-making, adaptability, and interaction with their environment. When thinking
  about AI agent use cases and the effort to implement them, it is important to understand
  the complexity of every agent being considered.'
