summary: Jenkins X Survey Results The Jenkins X survey was active for four weeks and
  closed on February 11 2022. We received lots of valuable insights into how people
  are using Jenkins X. We need more contributors in the Jenkins X community, so if
  you feel strongly about how Jenkins X should evolve, your best bet is to dive in
  and get your hands dirty:) Some highlights of the free text responses we got are
  collected here According to the survey, a typical Jenkinx X user works with Devops
  and Software Engineering This person is using Jenkins X version 3 on Amazon working
  in a company of 1-50 people. She finds it somewhat difficult to find documentation,
  average 2.9 out of 5 The Jenkins X user tries to find information mainly on the
  main web site, sometimes on slack and less often on github. What he enjoys most
  about Jenkins X is that it is an easy way to learn, play around and work with Kubernetes.
  The git(ops(ish)) style of configuration, the preview environments, and the staging
  /production environments. But one thing is sure, documentation is confusing and
  shold be improved. The typical Jenkins X user would like to run Jenkins X offline,
  either to run on a laptop, or behind a (corporate) firewall. Proper support for
  multi-tenancy would be nice, and who can ignore security in these times. A clear
  governance of Jenkins X needs to be established, The typical person who answers
  surveys on Jenkins X is planning to attend Jenkins X Office hours, which is great!
  See you there next week then! ← Previous.
