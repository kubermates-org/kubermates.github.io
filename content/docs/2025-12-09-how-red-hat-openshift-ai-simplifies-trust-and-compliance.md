  Artificial intelligence Open hybrid cloud Security Edge computing Infrastructure
  Applications Virtualization Share Artificial intelligence (AI) is reshaping every
  industry, but in highly regulated sectors, success isn’t measured only by accuracy
  but also by trust. Public agencies, healthcare providers, and financial institutions
  face a common challenge of delivering the benefits of AI while staying compliant
  with frameworks like FedRAMP, HIPAA, PCI DSS, and NIST 800-53. These standards set
  the rules for encryption, access control, auditing, and data handling. They also
  introduce operational constraints that limit where and how AI runs. Red Hat OpenShift
  AI helps to bridge that divide, allowing organizations to build and deploy protected
  AI where the data lives, across datacenters, public clouds, and edge environments.
  Regulatory data often can’t move freely. Privacy laws, jurisdictional boundaries,
  and internal risk policies typically govern how and where clinical records, payment
  data, and sensitive telemetry can be used. That immobility of the data gravity challenge
  is one of the most significant barriers to enterprise AI adoption. OpenShift AI
  reverses that equation. Instead of relocating data to cloud AI services, OpenShift
  AI brings the AI platform to the data. Since OpenShift AI runs consistently across
  on-premises, cloud, and edge environments, organizations can train and serve models
  near sensitive datasets, maintaining compliance, while using flexible compute resources
  as they see fit. Every platform layer reinforces this trust boundary: encryption,
  role-based access control (RBAC), network isolation, and continuous compliance scanning.'
