  Want to help? Kubeflow 1. 9 significantly simplifies the development, tuning and
  management of secure machine learning models and LLMs. Highlights include: Model
  Registry : Centralized management for ML models, versions, and artifacts. Fine-Tune
  APIs for LLMs : Simplifies fine-tuning of LLMs with custom datasets. Pipelines :
  Consolidation of Tekton and Argo Workflows backends for improved flexibility. Security
  Enhancements : Network policies, Oauth2-proxy, and CVE scanning. Integration Upgrades
  : Improved integrations with Ray, Seldon, BentoML, and KServe for LLM GPU optimizations.
  Installation and Documentation : Streamlined installation, updated platform dependencies,
  and enhanced documentation. These updates aim to simplify workflows, improve integration
  dependencies, and provide Kubernetes-native operational efficiencies for enterprise
  scale, security, and isolation. A model registry provides a central catalog for
  ML model developers to index and manage models, versions, and ML artifacts metadata.
  It fills a gap between model experimentation and production activities.'
