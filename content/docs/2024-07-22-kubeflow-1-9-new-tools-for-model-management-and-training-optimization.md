summary: 'Jul 22, 2024 • Kubeflow 1. 9 Release Team, Stefano Fioravanzo • 11 min read
  release Kubeflow 1. 9 significantly simplifies the development, tuning and management
  of secure machine learning models and LLMs. Highlights include: These updates aim
  to simplify workflows, improve integration dependencies, and provide Kubernetes-native
  operational efficiencies for enterprise scale, security, and isolation. A model
  registry provides a central catalog for ML model developers to index and manage
  models, versions, and ML artifacts metadata. It fills a gap between model experimentation
  and production activities. It provides a central interface for all stakeholders
  in the ML lifecycle to collaborate on ML models. Model registry has been asked by
  the community for a long time and we are delighted to introduce it to the Kubeflow
  ecosystem. This initial release includes REST APIs and a Python SDK to track model
  artifacts and model metadata with a standardized format that can be reused across
  Kubeflow components, such as to deploy Inference Servers. You can get started by
  following the Model Registry tutorial on the Kubeflow website , or see a short demo
  video of the Model Registry in action. We are just getting started. This is an Alpha
  version and we look forward to feedback.'
