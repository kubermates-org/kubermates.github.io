  \ OpenAI SDK: Today, weâ\x80\x99re excited to announce the General Availability\
  \ (GA) of DigitalOceanâ\x80\x99s Gradient Platform , a developer-first platform\
  \ that makes it easy to build, scale, and ship AI-powered applications. Gradient\
  \ Platform brings together everything you need to go from prototype to production\
  \ with AI, all in one fully managed experience. You can create intelligent agents\
  \ that reason over your data, integrate cutting-edge LLMs into your app with a single\
  \ API, or experiment with prebuilt tools, like evaluations or versioning, to accelerate\
  \ your AI development. Whether youâ\x80\x99re automating workflows, enhancing customer\
  \ support, or building new AI products from the ground up, the Platform gives you\
  \ all the power without the complexity of managing infrastructure. Thousands of\
  \ developers explored the platform during its public preview (formerly known as\
  \ the GenAI Platform). Their feedback helped shape the product launching today.\
  \ Todayâ\x80\x99s release brings you a comprehensive platform that makes it easier\
  \ to build, debug, and scale AI applications. New features like external data integration,\
  \ agent traceability, customer conversation logs, and agent evaluation give you\
  \ deeper visibility into how your agents behave, more control over their data and\
  \ logic, and better ways to collaborate across teamsâ\x80\x94all without adding\
  \ infrastructure overhead. Since the initial release in January 2025 , weâ\x80\x99\
  ve launched a wide range of enhancements driven by real-world adoption and evolving\
  \ use cases."
