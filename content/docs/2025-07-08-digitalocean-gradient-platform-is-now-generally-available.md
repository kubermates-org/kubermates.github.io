summary: "By Grace Morgan TL;DR: Gradient Platform (previously GenAI Platform) is\
  \ now generally available, offering a fully managed way to build and deploy AI apps\
  \ with agents and serverless inference. New features like external data integration,\
  \ traceability, and evaluations make it easy to go from prototype to productionâ\x80\
  \x94no infrastructure management required. -> Build an agent -> Call a model with\
  \ serverless inference -> Check out our tutorial on how to use serverless inference\
  \ and agents with the OpenAI SDK: Today, weâ\x80\x99re excited to announce the General\
  \ Availability (GA) of DigitalOceanâ\x80\x99s Gradient Platform , a developer-first\
  \ platform that makes it easy to build, scale, and ship AI-powered applications.\
  \ Gradient Platform brings together everything you need to go from prototype to\
  \ production with AI, all in one fully managed experience. You can create intelligent\
  \ agents that reason over your data, integrate cutting-edge LLMs into your app with\
  \ a single API, or experiment with prebuilt tools, like evaluations or versioning,\
  \ to accelerate your AI development. Whether youâ\x80\x99re automating workflows,\
  \ enhancing customer support, or building new AI products from the ground up, the\
  \ Platform gives you all the power without the complexity of managing infrastructure.\
  \ Thousands of developers explored the platform during its public preview (formerly\
  \ known as the GenAI Platform). Their feedback helped shape the product launching\
  \ today. Todayâ\x80\x99s release brings you a comprehensive platform that makes\
  \ it easier to build, debug, and scale AI applications. New features like external\
  \ data integration, agent traceability, customer conversation logs, and agent evaluation\
  \ give you deeper visibility into how your agents behave, more control over their\
  \ data and logic, and better ways to collaborate across teamsâ\x80\x94all without\
  \ adding infrastructure overhead. Since the initial release in January 2025 , weâ\x80\
  \x99ve launched a wide range of enhancements driven by real-world adoption and evolving\
  \ use cases. From foundational infrastructure upgrades to powerful new developer\
  \ tools, hereâ\x80\x99s whatâ\x80\x99s changed between public preview and General\
  \ Availability: Not every AI use case requires a full agent."
