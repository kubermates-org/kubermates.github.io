  Virtualization Share Today''s IT leaders face intense pressure to accelerate innovation
  while managing a complex mix of technologies. They are faced with the challenge
  of integrating AI, modernizing legacy systems and controlling costs within a complex
  hybrid cloud that spans datacenters, public clouds and the edge. The core question
  for every technology leader is how to build a platform strategy that tames this
  complexity, strengthens security and reliability, and creates a foundation for future
  growth. At Red Hat, our hybrid cloud strategy is designed to solve this challenge.
  We believe the solution is a consistent, open platform that empowers organizations
  to build and run any application, anywhere. Red Hat OpenShift is at the heart of
  this strategy, providing a single, trusted foundation for your existing virtualized
  applications as well as your modern, cloud-native services. By offering a powerful
  virtualization alternative through OpenShift Virtualization and a pathway into artificial
  intelligence with Red Hat OpenShift AI , OpenShift helps you connect the infrastructure
  you have today with the cloud-native future you are building for tomorrow. This
  is why I’m so proud that Red Hat has been named a Leader in The Forrester Wave™:
  Multicloud Container Platforms, Q3 2025. We feel that this recognition is highly
  respected, independent acknowledgement that our strategy is not only resonating
  with experts and observers, but also delivering tangible value to our customers.
  We believe that Forrester’s comprehensive evaluation, which scored Red Hat highest
  in both the “Current Offering” and “Strategy” categories, confirms that we are successfully
  addressing the most pressing needs of enterprise IT. The report notes, "Red Hat
  excels in core Kubernetes areas, offering robust operator options, powerful management,
  GitOps automation, and flexible interfaces. " Our technical excellence provides
  the stability and control your organization needs to more effectively manage critical
  applications at scale.'
