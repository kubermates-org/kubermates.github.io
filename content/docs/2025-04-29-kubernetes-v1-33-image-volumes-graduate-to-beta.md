  release as part of KEP-4639.
summary: 'Image Volumes were introduced as an Alpha feature with the Kubernetes v1.
  31 release as part of KEP-4639. In Kubernetes v1. 33, this feature graduates to
  beta. Please note that the feature is still disabled by default, because not all
  container runtimes have full support for it. CRI-O supports the initial feature
  since version v1. 31 and will add support for Image Volumes as beta in v1. 33. containerd
  merged support for the alpha feature which will be part of the v2. 1. 0 release
  and is working on beta support as part of PR #11578. The major change for the beta
  graduation of Image Volumes is the support for subPath and subPathExpr mounts for
  containers via spec.'
