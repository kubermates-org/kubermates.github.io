summary: 'Kubernetes v1. 33: Image Volumes graduate to beta! What''s new Further reading
  Image Volumes were introduced as an Alpha feature with the Kubernetes v1. 31 release
  as part of KEP-4639. In Kubernetes v1. 33, this feature graduates to beta. Please
  note that the feature is still disabled by default, because not all container runtimes
  have full support for it. CRI-O supports the initial feature since version v1. 31
  and will add support for Image Volumes as beta in v1. 33. containerd merged support
  for the alpha feature which will be part of the v2. 1. 0 release and is working
  on beta support as part of PR #11578.'
