  projects highlighted in this post Konnichiwa from Tokyo! 🇯🇵 In June 2025, something
  remarkable happened: the global cloud native community gathered in Tokyo for the
  first-ever KubeCon + CloudNativeCon Japan, hosted by the Cloud Native Computing
  Foundation (CNCF) under the Linux Foundation. This wasn’t just another tech conference—it
  was a proud milestone for Japan’s growing open source and cloud native ecosystem.
  KubeCon + CloudNativeCon Japan 2025 marked the first time the CNCF’s flagship event
  was held on Japanese soil—bringing together a full house of 1,500 attendees from
  across Japan and around the world. Hosted at the Hilton Tokyo Odaiba , the event
  featured over 40 sessions covering the full spectrum of cloud native technologies,
  ranging from beginner-friendly topics and observability to AI/ML, platform engineering,
  connectivity, and security. The two days were packed with innovation, collaboration,
  and connection. Developers, maintainers, end users, and technologists of all stripes
  came together to share lessons learned, explore emerging trends, and dive deep into
  the future of open source infrastructure. In addition to technical talks, the conference
  emphasized community building—celebrating contributors, spotlighting regional efforts,
  and encouraging diverse perspectives. For many Japanese attendees, it was a rare
  opportunity to engage with the global cloud native ecosystem right at home. For
  international guests, it was a chance to experience Japan’s fast-growing tech culture
  firsthand. While CNCF and the Linux Foundation brought usual professionalism to
  organizing KubeCon + CloudNativeCon Japan, we at Cloud Native Community Japan (CNCJ)
  were proud to support the local community layer —bridging global expertise with
  Japanese voices and initiatives. One of our most successful contributions was organizing
  Japan Community Day , held on June 15 , just ahead of the main conference. This
  CNCJ-led event gathered local contributors, meetup organizers, and engineers from
  across Japan and from overseas.'
