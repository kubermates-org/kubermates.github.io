  Meshery, recognized as the CNCF’s sixth highest-velocity project, offers a thoughtfully
  designed contributor onboarding experience. This includes weekly newcomer meetings,

  and Meshery Extensibility. Tailored for developers possessing intermediate skills
  in Go, React, and OpenAPI schemas, and with hands-on experience in Meshery’s codebase,
  this certification affirms an individual’s capability to make substantial contributions
  to project development. This includes adept code implementation, thorough testing,
  seamless integration, and strategic optimization. Track: Developers Target Audience
  : Developers, technical writers, and community members. Prerequisites: Proficiency
  in Git and GitHub, familiar with Meshery’s architecture, and healthy understanding
  of open source collaboration. Key Focus: Ability to competently participate as an
  open source contributor across the core collection of Meshery’s architectural domains,
  demonstrating understanding of code (Go, JavaScript), documentation, and CI-based
  project enhancements.'
