  + CloudNativeCon North America 2025 hosted an exclusive end-user summit for cloud-native
  leaders and innovators. This gathering provided a unique opportunity to network
  with industry experts, exchange ideas, and learn about the latest trends in cloud
  native technology. This year’s theme, “Engaging with AI,” brought together technology
  leaders from top enterprises to explore how organizations are adopting and scaling
  artificial intelligence responsibly and effectively. The afternoon featured fireside
  chats with executives from End User member companies, followed by focused breakout
  discussions on vendor selection, scaling AI initiatives, and demonstrating ROI.
  The conversations revealed both the promise and the complexity of enterprise AI,
  highlighting the tension between rapid innovation and structured governance. The
  event underscored a shared theme: AI transformation is much more about organizational
  agility and culture than it is about technology. Members of the Artificial Intelligence
  Technical Community Group attended the event and participated in multiple conversations.
  This blog highlights the pain points, patterns, and solutions that emerged from
  the discussions. Despite enthusiasm for AI’s potential, most organizations are struggling
  to reconcile innovation with operational constraints. The summit identified several
  recurring pain points, including vendor management, governance, ROI measurement,
  standardization, and driving adoption. These challenges are often interdependent,
  slowing execution even when leadership support is strong and the budget is available.
  AI ecosystems evolve quickly.'
