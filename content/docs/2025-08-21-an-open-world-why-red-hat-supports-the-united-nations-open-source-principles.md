tldr: Share At Red Hat, we have always believed that the best technology comes from
  open collaboration. It’s no secret that the components of Red Hat’s products, from

summary: 'Share At Red Hat, we have always believed that the best technology comes
  from open collaboration. It’s no secret that the components of Red Hat’s products,
  from the world’s leading enterprise Linux platform to the latest AI innovations
  of Red Hat AI Inference Server , are created in the upstream, in the open, with
  communities and projects that make them possible. For three decades, open source
  has been a core tenet for Red Hat. While the broader technology world was slower
  to embrace it, more and more organizations are turning to open source-first approaches
  each year. This is why Red Hat, as a champion of open source technologies and practices,
  is pleased to formally endorse the United Nations (UN) Open Source Principles. These
  principles echo how we have always worked by building in the open, contributing
  back, and nurturing communities that thrive because of inclusion and collaboration.
  These guidelines aim to drive collaboration and open source adoption within the
  UN and globally, and were produced by the Open Source United Community as part of
  the UN Chief Executive Board’s Digital Technology Network. The principles encompass:
  Open by default: Making open source the standard approach for projects. Contribute
  back: Encouraging active participation in the open source ecosystem. Secure by design:
  Making security a priority in all software projects. Foster inclusive participation
  and community building: Enabling and facilitating diverse and inclusive contributions.
  Design for reusability: Designing projects to be interoperable across various platforms
  and ecosystems.'
