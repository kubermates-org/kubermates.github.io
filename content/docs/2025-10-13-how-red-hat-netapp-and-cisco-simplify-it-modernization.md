  Infrastructure Applications Virtualization Share For enterprise IT, modernizing
  infrastructure isn't about following trends, it's the way to maximize efficiency
  and ensure continued support. The ideal path to modernization combines compute,
  storage, and networking into a single, cohesive system that's easy to deploy. It
  uses enterprise-grade storage for intelligent data management, and runs on an enterprise-tested
  application platform that handles containers and virtual machines (VM) in a unified
  environment. It allows you to develop and deploy applications in your data center,
  and then move them to the cloud as needed, without retooling. Ultimately, modernization
  done well helps your developers deploy applications faster, lets your IT teams (from
  network to storage to sysadmins) coordinate, and saves you time and money. Enterprise
  IT cannot rely on trial and error. Consider hardware, for instance. It would take
  weeks (if not months) to piece together compute, storage, and networking from multiple
  vendors. Then there's integration testing, stress and load testing. Then there's
  the constant worry about whether you deployed the most efficient and cost effective
  solution. And that's before you even get to the application stack. Are you trying
  to modernize from a legacy monolithic architecture to a more modern, cloud-native
  approach? Do you need a hypervisor for virtual machines? Can you scale and migrate
  applications from on-premises to a cloud hyperscaler without refactoring? A solution
  to this problem is needed now, more than ever.
