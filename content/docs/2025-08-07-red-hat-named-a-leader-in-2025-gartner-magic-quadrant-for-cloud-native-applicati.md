tldr: Share This week we announced that Red Hat has been positioned as a Leader for
  the second year in a row in the 2025 Gartner® Magic Quadrant™ for Cloud-Native Application
  Platforms. We are proud of this recognition, as we believe this is a strong validation
  of Red Hat OpenShift cloud services as a flexible, complete, and secure cloud-native
  application platform for AI-enabled applications and virtualized and containerized
  workloads across the hybrid cloud.

  services portfolio consists of jointly engineered solutions with hyperscalers, including
  Red Hat OpenShift Service on AWS , Azure Red Hat OpenShift , Red Hat OpenShift on
  IBM Cloud and Red Hat OpenShift Dedicated on Google Cloud. Source: Gartner, “Magic
  Quadrant for Cloud-Native Application Platforms,” August 2025 To help further explain
  the evaluation of the Gartner Magic Quadrant from our point of view, we’re answering
  some of the most frequently asked questions. “Magic Quadrant reports are a culmination
  of rigorous, fact-based research in specific markets, providing a wide-angle view
  of the relative positions of the providers in markets where growth is high and provider
  differentiation is distinct. Providers are positioned into four quadrants: Leaders,
  Challengers, Visionaries and Niche Players. The research enables you to get the
  most from market analysis in alignment with your unique business and technology
  needs. ” “Gartner defines cloud-native application platforms as those that provide
  managed application runtime environments for applications and integrated capabilities
  to manage the life cycle of an application or application component. They typically
  enable distributed application deployments and support cloud style operations —
  such as elasticity, multitenancy and self-service — without requiring the development
  team to provision infrastructure or manage containers. Cloud-native application
  platforms are designed to facilitate the deployment, runtime execution, and management
  of modern cloud-native or cloud-optimized applications without the need to manage
  any underlying infrastructure. Also, they are designed to enhance developer productivity,
  accelerate development and deployment cycles, and increase operational effectiveness
  by making it easier to scale on demand. Cloud-native application platforms offer
  a structured execution environment for applications, effectively hiding the complexities
  of the underlying infrastructure and computing resources.'
