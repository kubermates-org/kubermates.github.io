  week we announced that Red Hat has been positioned as a Leader for the second year
  in a row in the 2025 Gartner® Magic Quadrant™ for Cloud-Native Application Platforms.
  We are proud of this recognition, as we believe this is a strong validation of Red
  Hat OpenShift cloud services as a flexible, complete, and secure cloud-native application
  platform for AI-enabled applications and virtualized and containerized workloads
  across the hybrid cloud.

  Share This week we announced that Red Hat has been positioned as a Leader for the
  second year in a row in the 2025 Gartner® Magic Quadrant™ for Cloud-Native Application
  Platforms. We are proud of this recognition, as we believe this is a strong validation
  of Red Hat OpenShift cloud services as a flexible, complete, and secure cloud-native
  application platform for AI-enabled applications and virtualized and containerized
  workloads across the hybrid cloud. The Red Hat OpenShift cloud services portfolio
  consists of jointly engineered solutions with hyperscalers, including Red Hat OpenShift
  Service on AWS , Azure Red Hat OpenShift , Red Hat OpenShift on IBM Cloud and Red
  Hat OpenShift Dedicated on Google Cloud. Source: Gartner, “Magic Quadrant for Cloud-Native
  Application Platforms,” August 2025 To help further explain the evaluation of the
  Gartner Magic Quadrant from our point of view, we’re answering some of the most
  frequently asked questions. “Magic Quadrant reports are a culmination of rigorous,
  fact-based research in specific markets, providing a wide-angle view of the relative
  positions of the providers in markets where growth is high and provider differentiation
  is distinct. Providers are positioned into four quadrants: Leaders, Challengers,
  Visionaries and Niche Players. The research enables you to get the most from market
  analysis in alignment with your unique business and technology needs. ” “Gartner
  defines cloud-native application platforms as those that provide managed application
  runtime environments for applications and integrated capabilities to manage the
  life cycle of an application or application component. They typically enable distributed
  application deployments and support cloud style operations — such as elasticity,
  multitenancy and self-service — without requiring the development team to provision
  infrastructure or manage containers. Cloud-native application platforms are designed
  to facilitate the deployment, runtime execution, and management of modern cloud-native
  or cloud-optimized applications without the need to manage any underlying infrastructure.
  Also, they are designed to enhance developer productivity, accelerate development
  and deployment cycles, and increase operational effectiveness by making it easier
  to scale on demand. Cloud-native application platforms offer a structured execution
  environment for applications, effectively hiding the complexities of the underlying
  infrastructure and computing resources.'
