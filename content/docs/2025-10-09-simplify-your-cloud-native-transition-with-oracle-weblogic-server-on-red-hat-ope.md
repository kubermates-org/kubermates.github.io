  are under increasing pressure to modernize critical applications while maintaining
  the reliability, security, and performance of their existing IT investments. Many
  business-critical workloads, including financial systems and telecommunications
  services, run on Oracle WebLogic Server. At the same time, organizations are embracing
  cloud-native platforms like Red Hat OpenShift to gain the agility, scalability,
  and consistency needed in hybrid and multicloud cloud environments. Working with
  the Oracle WebLogic team, Oracle's validation of WebLogic Server on Red Hat OpenShift
  Virtualization allows your organization to leverage current investments as you move
  to fully containerized workloads. In addition, Oracle also supports WebLogic Server
  on Red Hat OpenShift. Oracle has validated WebLogic Server on Red Hat OpenShift
  Virtualization , enabling organizations to modernize applications by bridging existing
  investments with cloud-native environments. This validation, alongside support for
  WebLogic Server on Red Hat OpenShift , empowers you to consolidate your infrastructure
  and manage both virtual machines and containers on a unified platform. Red Hat's
  collaboration with Oracle provides the ability to run your existing WebLogic Server
  workload in a virtual machine (VM) while taking advantage of OpenShift's Kubernetes-based
  foundation (highlighted in Gartner's 2025 Magic Quadrant for Container Management
  for the third year in a row). Organizations can consolidate infrastructure by managing
  both VMs and containers through a common cloud-native platform. This reduces operational
  complexity, streamlines management, and accelerates time-to-market for new services.
  For IT leaders, this means they can continue to leverage their WebLogic investments
  without rewriting applications. Development teams gain a pathway to modernize applications
  gradually, shifting from virtualized workloads to microservices and containers at
  their own pace.
