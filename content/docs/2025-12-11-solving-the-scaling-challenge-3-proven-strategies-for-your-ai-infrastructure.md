  Applications Virtualization Share Every team that starts experimenting with generative
  AI (gen AI) eventually runs into the same wall: scaling it. Running 1 or 2 models
  is simple enough. Running dozens, supporting hundreds of users, and keeping GPU
  costs under control, is something else entirely. Teams often find themselves juggling
  hardware requests, managing multiple versions of the same model, and trying to deliver
  performance that actually holds up in production. These are the same kinds of infrastructure
  and operations challenges we have seen in other workloads, but now applied to AI
  systems that demand far more resources and coordination. In this post, we look at
  3 practical strategies that help organizations solve these scaling problems: GPU-as-a-Service
  to make better use of expensive GPU hardware Models-as-a-Service to give teams controlled
  and reliable access to shared models Scalable inference with vLLM and llm-d to achieve
  production-grade, run-time performance efficiently When moving from proof of concept
  to production, cost quickly becomes the first barrier. Running large models in production
  is expensive, especially when training, tuning, and inference workloads all compete
  for GPU capacity. Control is another challenge. IT teams must balance freedom to
  experiment with guardrails that strengthen security and compliance.'
