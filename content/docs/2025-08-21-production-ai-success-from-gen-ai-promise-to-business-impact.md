summary: 'Share Generative AI (gen AI) has the potential to significantly improve
  customer engagement, reduce costs, and boost productivity. However, many enterprises
  struggle to move beyond initial experiments to widespread and scalable implementations.
  This article examines 6 common obstacles to enterprise AI adoption —as highlighted
  in this Harvard Business Review report —and how Red Hat can help you overcome them.
  Many organizations initiate gen AI projects without a defined strategy or roadmap.
  This can lead to fragmented efforts that make it difficult to demonstrate a return
  on investment (ROI). A well-articulated strategy is crucial for successful adoption.
  You may also find your organization struggling to align AI solutions with specific,
  impactful business use cases. Demonstrating clear business value can often be a
  challenge. How Red Hat helps: A global shortage of skilled AI talent is a growing
  problem. This isn''t just a bottleneck—it can prevent your organization from fully
  harnessing AI''s transformative potential. Addressing this gap requires strategies
  for developing both future and current workforces. How Red Hat helps: Many existing
  IT and data infrastructures are unprepared for gen AI integration.'
