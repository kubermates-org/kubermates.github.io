  open source tools such as Feast to build a workflow you can run on your laptop and
  adapt to your own projects. We’ll walk through the entire ML lifecycle—from data

  model-registry kserve Are you looking for a practical, reproducible way to take
  a machine learning project from raw data all the way to a deployed, production-ready
  model? This post is your blueprint for the AI/ML lifecycle: you’ll learn how to
  use Kubeflow and open source tools such as Feast to build a workflow you can run
  on your laptop and adapt to your own projects. We’ll walk through the entire ML
  lifecycle—from data preparation to live inference—leveraging the Kubeflow platform
  to create a cohesive, production-grade MLOps workflow. The project implements a
  complete MLOps workflow for a fraud detection use case. Fraud detection is a critical
  application in financial services, where organizations need to identify potentially
  fraudulent transactions in real-time while minimizing false positives that could
  disrupt legitimate customer activity. Our fraud detection system leverages machine
  learning to analyze large volumes of transaction data, learn patterns from historical
  behavior, and flag suspicious transactions that deviate from normal patterns. The
  model considers various features such as transaction amounts, location data, merchant
  information, and user behavior patterns to make predictions. This makes fraud detection
  an ideal use case for demonstrating MLOps concepts because it requires: The workflow
  ingests raw transaction data, proceeds through data preparation and feature engineering,
  then model training and registration, and finally deploys the model as a production-ready
  inference service that can evaluate transactions in real-time. The entire workflow
  is orchestrated as a Kubeflow Pipeline, which provides a powerful framework for
  defining, deploying, and managing complex machine learning pipelines on Kubernetes.
  Here is a high-level overview of the pipeline: The pipeline assumes that the initial
  datasets ( train. csv , test. csv , etc. ) are already available.'
