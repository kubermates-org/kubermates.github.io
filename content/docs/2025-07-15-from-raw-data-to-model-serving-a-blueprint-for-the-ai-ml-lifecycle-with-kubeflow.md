summary: 'Project Overview A Note on the Data Why Kubeflow? Key Benefits Getting Started:
  Prerequisites and Cluster Setup Prerequisites 1. Create a Local Kubernetes Cluster
  2. Deploy Kubeflow Pipelines 3. Upload the Raw Data to MinIO 4. Install Model Registry,
  KServe, Spark Operator, and Set Policies Building and Understanding the Pipeline

  1. Data Preparation with Spark 2. Feature Engineering with Feast 3. Model Training
  4. Model Registration 5. Real-Time Inference with KServe Importing and Running the

  Are you looking for a practical, reproducible way to take a machine learning project
  from raw data all the way to a deployed, production-ready model? This post is your
  blueprint for the AI/ML lifecycle: you’ll learn how to use Kubeflow and open source
  tools such as Feast to build a workflow you can run on your laptop and adapt to
  your own projects. We’ll walk through the entire ML lifecycle—from data preparation
  to live inference—leveraging the Kubeflow platform to create a cohesive, production-grade
  MLOps workflow. The project implements a complete MLOps workflow for a fraud detection
  use case.'
