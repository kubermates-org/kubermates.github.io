  Share As our reliance on connected devices and software deepens, the need for robust,
  transparent, and consistent cybersecurity practices is increasingly critical. The
  European Union''s Cyber Resilience Act (CRA) represents a landmark legislative moment,
  with the act’s purpose to be “ensuring that hardware and software products are placed
  on the market with fewer vulnerabilities and that manufacturers take security seriously
  throughout a product''s lifecycle”. This welcomed initiative aims to protect consumers
  and businesses with products that are secure by design and manufacturers who are
  transparent about their security practices. At Red Hat, we believe that a more secure
  digital future is built on open principles and collaboration. We support the goals
  of the CRA and are engaged in the critical work of shaping its implementation such
  as implementing/delegated acts, guidance for open source as well as Harmonized European
  Standards (hEN), that will underpin this regulation. Our commitment is not just
  about compliance, it''s about using our expertise in open source and enterprise
  security to help build a more resilient and trustworthy digital ecosystem for everyone.
  The success of the CRA hinges on the development of practical, effective, and widely
  accepted harmonised standards. These standards will provide manufacturers with a
  clear framework for meeting the Act''s essential requirements. Red Hat is contributing
  to this process through our participation in key European Standardisation Organisations
  (ESOs), which the EU Commission mandated to produce these standards. Our involvement
  is twofold, addressing both broad, cross-sectoral standards and those specific to
  the following key technology domains: Horizontal standards (CEN/CENELEC): We are
  an active member of the Committee for Standardization (CEN) and European Committee
  for Electrotechnical Standardization (CENELEC) Joint Technical Committee 13 Working
  Group 9 (JTC 13/WG 9) on Cybersecurity and Data Protection. This body is responsible
  for developing horizontal standards that are expected to be used by manufacturers
  that develop products across various industries. We contribute to these areas by
  making secure software development practices practical and clear, helping define
  foundational principles for vulnerability management and supply chain security that
  align directly with modern, open source development methods.'
