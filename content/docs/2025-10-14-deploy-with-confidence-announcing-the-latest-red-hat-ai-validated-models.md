  Infrastructure Applications Virtualization Share We are excited to introduce our
  most recent validated models , designed to empower your deployments. At Red Hat,
  our goal is to provide the confidence, predictability, and flexibility organizations
  need to deploy third-party gen AI models across the Red Hat AI platform. This release
  expands our collection of performance-benchmarked and accuracy-evaluated optimized
  models, helping you accelerate time to value and select the perfect fit for your
  enterprise use case. Red Hat AI’s validated models go beyond a simple list, providing
  efficient, enterprise-ready AI. We combine rigorous performance benchmarking and
  accuracy testing with a comprehensive packaging process designed to deploy with
  security and simplicity in mind. Each model is scanned for vulnerabilities and integrated
  into a managed software lifecycle, helping ensure you receive a high-performing
  and resource-optimized asset that is focused on security, easy to manage, and ready
  for long-term updates. The world of large language models (LLMs) is expanding rapidly,
  making it difficult for enterprises to choose the right one. Organizations often
  struggle with AI resource capacity planning and ensuring that a model''s performance
  can be reliably reproduced. That''s where Red Hat''s validated models come in. We
  provide access to a set of ready-to-use, third-party models that run efficiently
  on vLLM within our platform. We simplify the selection process by performing extensive
  testing for you. Our model validation process includes: Performance benchmarking
  using GuideLLM to assess resource requirements and cost on various hardware configurations.'
