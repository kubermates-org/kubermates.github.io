  DevOps? Kubernetes = Core Skill → CKA, CKAD, and CKS prove real, hands-on expertise.
  Over 3,000 jobs explicitly ask for them. Terraform = IaC Standard → Terraform Associate
  (003) dominates; 15k+ U. S. job postings mention it. CI/CD Has Shifted → Jenkins
  is legacy; GitHub Actions & GitLab certifications are the new benchmarks. Linux
  = Bedrock → LFCS, RHCSA, RHCE remain evergreen. 10k+ jobs still require Linux fluency.
  Maturity Layer Matters → Security (CKS, AWS Security Specialty), Reliability (Google
  DevOps Engineer), and Cost (FOCP) now separate leaders from juniors. Observability
  = No Longer Optional → Grafana/Prometheus certifications validate modern monitoring
  and tracing. Certifications = Multipliers, Not Magic → They amplify hands-on skills
  and career progression; 81% of certified pros report better job opportunities. Picture
  this: it’s spring 2025, and you’re sitting in an interview for a mid-to-senior DevOps
  engineer role.'
