  your company’s operating environment starts with the operating system (OS), but
  it doesn’t end there. As the number of systems grows, configurations drift, maintenance
  becomes repetitive, and updates can quickly turn into a headache. At Red Hat, we
  support your standardization journey by providing you with what you need to deliver
  a robust, coherent, and integrated solution for your standard operating environment.
  In this post, I explore the key areas you should take into account along your standardization
  journey, and how these can be simplified using Red Hat technologies, products, and
  services. Over time, daily activities on systems can lead to configuration drifts,
  issues with running workloads and a potential exposure to threats. The best way
  to start a standardization journey is to have a consistent baseline that your whole
  infrastructure can rely on, whether it's on bare metal, hypervisors, or the cloud.
  Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) offers two different ways to start building installation
  images that are hardened, pre-configured with the tools you need, and most of all,
  that are repeatable over time. Included in RHEL, and also available in the Red Hat
  Insights service, image builder allows you to define a blueprint of an operating
  system image. Your image can contain as many customizations as you need, including
  users, firewall rules, repositories, and which packages to include. You can apply
  security profiles to harden your image, and much more. Image builder can generate
  installation media (such as an ISO, cloud provider image, hypervisor image, and
  so on) that can be deployed on-premises, in the cloud, or at the edge. Based on
  the open source bootc project , image mode introduces a new way to build and manage
  RHEL systems at scale.
