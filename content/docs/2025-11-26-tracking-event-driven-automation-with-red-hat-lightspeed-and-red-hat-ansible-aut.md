  organizations shift from reactive automation to proactive and intelligence-driven
  operations, Event-Driven Ansible continues to gain momentum. By combining real-time
  system insights from Red Hat Lightspeed (formerly Red Hat Insights) with Event-Driven
  Ansible rulebooks, teams can automatically respond to security risks, configuration
  changes, compliance findings, and operational anomalies, without waiting for human
  intervention. With Red Hat Ansible Automation Platform 2.6 , we introduced a small
  but meaningful enhancement that strengthens trust and observability in automated
  operations. Any job triggered by Event-Driven Ansible now automatically includes
  a label in the automation controller. This simple addition provides powerful value.
  Teams can now easily identify, audit, and verify event-initiated automation, enabling
  clearer reporting, faster troubleshooting, and improved security posture awareness.
  In this article, I show you how this feature works using Red Hat Lightspeed events
  as the automation source, including a simple rulebook example you can try today.
  As organizations scale automation, one question comes up again and again: How do
  you know which changes happened automatically and which were triggered by a human?
  With event-driven automation, this becomes even more important. Security teams,
  site reliability engineers (SRE), platform engineers, and compliance officers need
  to answer: What action was taken automatically? Which event triggered the automation?
  When did it run, and on which system? Was the remediation successful? Ansible Automation
  Platform 2.6 answers these questions by tagging jobs initiated through Event-Driven
  Ansible. The result is: Clear separation of automated and manual actions Better
  auditability and governance Faster investigation and troubleshooting Greater confidence
  in automated remediation pipelines Red Hat Lightspeed brings AI-powered operational
  intelligence directly into your automation workflows, transforming raw system signals
  into actionable, real-time insights. Instead of waiting for alerts to be manually
  reviewed, Red Hat Lightspeed evaluates system state, security posture, configuration
  drift, lifecycle status, and compliance policies, and emits structured events that
  can immediately trigger automation.'
