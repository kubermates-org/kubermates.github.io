summary: 'Share Red Hat makes it a strategic priority to offer energy-efficient products,
  addressing the growing demand of our customers for sustainable IT solutions. Our
  efforts are driven by minimizing the increase in energy consumption of AI, cloud
  computing, and IT infrastructure. Red Hat focuses on open source technologies designed
  to improve energy efficiency across IT environments. This includes: InstructLab
  is an open source project that enhances large language models (LLMs) used in generative
  AI (gen AI), upgrading an LLM with less human input and fewer resources than retraining.
  One of the key aspects of InstructLab is its focus on smaller, fine-tuned language
  models. This approach directly translates to improved energy efficiency compared
  to larger, more resource-intensive LLMs deployed by competitors. Smaller language
  models require significantly less computational power for training and inference,
  leading to reduced energy consumption. InstructLab optimizes performance by tailoring
  SLMs to specific tasks or domains, enhancing efficiency, minimizing wasteful energy,
  and enabling models to run on lower-power CPUs as opposed to power-hungry GPUs.
  This lower energy consumption results in reduced operational costs, providing both
  financial benefits and support for sustainability goals. Red Hat''s energy-efficient
  solutions offer significant benefits for enterprises, from reducing operational
  costs to helping achieve ambitious sustainability targets. By optimizing resource
  utilization and enhancing performance, these solutions also provide a crucial competitive
  advantage in today''s market, which include: Red Hat and SoftBank have collaborate
  d on Artificial Intelligence Radio Access Network (AI-RAN) to optimize power consumption
  in datacenters powering AI applications and vRAN. This project integrates Kepler,
  an open source project founded at Red Hat, into SoftBank''s AI and Telecom Radio
  Access System (AITRAS) platform.'
