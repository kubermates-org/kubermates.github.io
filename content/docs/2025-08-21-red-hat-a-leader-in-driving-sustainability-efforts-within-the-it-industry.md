  Artificial intelligence Open hybrid cloud Security Edge computing Infrastructure
  Applications Virtualization Share Red Hat makes it a strategic priority to offer
  energy-efficient products, addressing the growing demand of our customers for sustainable
  IT solutions. Our efforts are driven by minimizing the increase in energy consumption
  of AI, cloud computing, and IT infrastructure. Red Hat focuses on open source technologies
  designed to improve energy efficiency across IT environments. This includes: AI
  optimization : With Red Hat AI, you have access to Red Hat AI Inference Server to
  optimize model inference across the hybrid cloud for faster, cost-effective deployments.
  Powered by vLLM , the inference server maximizes GPU utilization and enables faster
  response times, thereby reducing the computational resources and energy required
  for AI workloads. Virtualization : Red Hat OpenShift Virtualization consolidates
  multiple virtual machines (VMs) onto fewer physical servers, directly translating
  to lower energy consumption and increased hardware utilization. System monitoring
  : Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) supports performance Co-Pilot (PCP), which provides
  detailed, real-time visibility into system performance and energy usage, enabling
  customers to identify and address inefficiencies. Power monitoring : Power monitoring
  for Red Hat OpenShift provides detailed insights into power consumption, improving
  adoption of energy-aware computing within cloud-native ecosystems. Intelligent automation
  : Red Hat Ansible Automation Platform boosts operational efficiency, reducing system
  down times, and intelligently optimizing resource utilization, which all contributes
  to a lower carbon footprint and enhanced energy efficiency. InstructLab is an open
  source project that enhances large language models (LLMs) used in generative AI
  (gen AI), upgrading an LLM with less human input and fewer resources than retraining.
  One of the key aspects of InstructLab is its focus on smaller, fine-tuned language
  models. This approach directly translates to improved energy efficiency compared
  to larger, more resource-intensive LLMs deployed by competitors.'
