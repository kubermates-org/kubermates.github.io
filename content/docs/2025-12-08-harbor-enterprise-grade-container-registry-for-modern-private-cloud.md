  Using Harbor as an Image Registry Conclusion Posted on December 8, 2025 by By Dhruv
  Tyagi, Broadcom CNCF projects highlighted in this post In the evolving landscape
  of application deployment, containerization with Kubernetes (K8s) has become the
  new standard. As organizations adopt Kubernetes at scale, public image registries
  often bring new challenges, from rate limits and escalating costs to limited control
  over sensitive data. Harbor bridges this gap as an open-source, enterprise-grade
  container registry that brings security, performance, and sovereignty to container
  image management. It seamlessly integrates with existing operational paradigms,
  providing a robust solution for modern container image management needs. Open-sourced
  in 2016, Harbor joined the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) on July 31,
  2018, and graduated on June 15, 2020, as its eleventh project – a milestone that
  reflects both its maturity and its vibrant community. Today, Harbor remains one
  of the most widely adopted CNCF projects for secure image management across hybrid
  and private cloud environments. The active community drives continuous innovation.
  Each release adds new integrations, security features, and performance improvements,
  ensuring Harbor evolves alongside enterprise cloud-native needs. Recent highlights
  include: ​​v2.13: Integration with CloudNativeAI (CNAI) for AI model management,
  extended audit logging, and enhanced OIDC with PKCE support v2.12: Integration with
  ACR and ACR EE Registry v2.11: Native SBOM generation and management At its core,
  Harbor provides a centralized repository for managing container images. Think of
  it as a private, feature-rich registry for your organization, with robust security
  and management features built in. Key features include: Security: Image vulnerability
  scanning, content trust, and role-based access control. Replication: Replicate images
  across multiple Harbor instances for disaster recovery and content distribution.'
