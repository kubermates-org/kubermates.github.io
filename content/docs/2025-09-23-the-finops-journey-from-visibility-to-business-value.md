  in VMware Private AI Let’s be real — IT costs can be a black box. Servers hum, invoices
  arrive, and before you know it, your cloud spend is climbing faster than your budget
  can keep up. That’s where FinOps comes in. If you haven’t heard the term before,
  Financial Operations (FinOps) is all about bringing financial discipline to the
  way you run IT. It’s the practice of tracking, forecasting, and optimizing spending
  on IT resources so that every dollar works harder. FinOps isn’t just for the big
  players anymore. What started as a process for larger service providers has now
  been embraced by smaller businesses, giving them the same ability to control cloud
  costs, improve efficiency, and drive smarter financial decisions. Why? Because when
  IT understands the true cost of delivering services, it stops being “just” a cost
  center and becomes a strategic business partner. And every organization’s path to
  FinOps maturity is different, but most will move through these three phases. Phase
  1: Gaining an understanding of their costs (Inform) Phase 2: To planning and budgeting
  for future projects (Optimize) Phase 3: To ultimately, running IT like a business
  (Operate) The good news? Regardless of where you are in the process, VMware Cloud
  Foundation and its FinOps capabilities can help at every step. Phase 1 of the FinOps
  journey begins with understanding and managing your costs. Why This Matters: Financial
  Operations (FinOps) is about more than just saving money.'
