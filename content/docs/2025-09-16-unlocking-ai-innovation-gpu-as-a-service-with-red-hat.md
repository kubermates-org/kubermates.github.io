  Edge computing Infrastructure Applications Virtualization Share Graphics processing
  units (GPUs) are key to both generative and predictive AI. Data scientists, machine
  learning engineers, and AI engineers rely on GPUs to experiment with AI models,
  and to train, tune, and deploy them. Managing these essential resources can be complex,
  however, often stalling development and innovation. Infrastructure limitations shouldn''t
  hold your organization back. Your team needs to focus on building, refining, and
  using AI models, not managing complex GPU infrastructure. This is why information
  technology operations (ITOps) plays a crucial role in enabling rapid AI development
  and inference by providing on-demand GPU access, also known as GPU-as-a-Service.
  Setting up an efficient GPU infrastructure for AI workloads is not trivial, and
  ITOps teams face several significant challenges: GPU scarcity and cost constraints
  : GPUs can be challenging to access due to limited supply, cloud constraints, and
  internal competition. This can be further compounded with a lack of customer choice
  and control over the underlying accelerator architecture, not to mention that. GPUs
  already come with high costs, including acquisition and operational expenses, and
  are often underused. Lack of GPU access drives shadow IT : If data scientists, ML
  engineers, and AI engineers cannot readily access GPUs when they need them, they
  may turn to "shadow IT. " This can mean using third-party services, potentially
  exposing sensitive company data, or independently procuring GPU resources from various
  cloud providers, leading to increased costs and security risks. This results in
  a loss of control over resource usage, data security, and compliance.'
