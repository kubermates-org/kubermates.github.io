  Share Generative AI demands infrastructure that’s not only powerful but repeatable,
  auditable, and scalable. From chat bots and content generation to intelligent automation
  agents, organizations are deploying AI at scale. But with this innovation comes
  complexity. In short, deploying generative AI isn’t just about models, it’s about
  managing the infrastructure and operations behind them reliably. The Red Hat Certified
  Collection, amazon. ai , addresses this problem by bringing infrastructure-as-code
  principles to AI and operational monitoring. Even with powerful services like Amazon
  Bedrock and DevOps Guru, organizations face hurdles: Agent lifecycle complexity
  : Bedrock Agents can orchestrate multiple models and APIs, but creating, updating,
  and validating these agents manually is tedious and prone to error.'
