  world of high performance computing (HPC) drives much of the major scientific advances
  throughout the world. As one of the most trusted enterprise Linux platforms, Red
  Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) serves as the foundation for many of these HPC workloads,
  serving industries such as automotive, financial services, biomedical, energy, and
  beyond. Meanwhile, the public cloud has continued to gain traction in the broader
  compute marketplace, offering tremendous flexibility and dynamic infrastructure.
  This trend has been emerging as well for HPC, with organizations looking to take
  advantage of that same flexibility and extra compute capacity in order to scale
  HPC clusters on demand, shortening their product development or research cycles.
  This is why we’re excited to launch a new offering: RHEL for HPC on Azure. We’ve
  partnered closely with Microsoft to identify the technical requirements to accelerate
  the time-to-deployment for our shared customers. With RHEL for HPC on Azure, you
  get the automation that installs the tools and libraries required for an accelerated
  HPC compute environment on Azure infrastructure. The RHEL HPC 9.6 for Azure cloud
  offering is based on RHEL system roles. The RHEL HPC system role is a Red Hat Ansible
  Automation Platform role specifically designed to simplify the deployment and configuration
  of HPC environments. This system role installs necessary third-party components
  that customers would otherwise have to manually integrate, such as the NVIDIA CUDA
  Driver, CUDA Toolkit, NVIDIA Collective Communications Library (NCCL), NVIDIA Fabric
  Manager, NVIDIA RDMA packages, and Open MPI. It is modular, allowing users to selectively
  install or skip specific packages and offering functionalities such as configuring
  storage volumes to ensure enough disk space is allocated for these large installations
  on Azure. You can now select the RHEL HPC image listing in the Azure market place.'
