  January 6, 2026 2 min read In 2025, we were relentless in our drive to build the
  comprehensive agentic cloud, made possible through the hard work and dedication
  of over 1,500 DigitalOcean “Sharks” around the globe. As we kick off 2026, we’re

  If that sounds like you, you’re invited to discover what DigitalOcean has to offer:
  Our culture of high performance and deep commitment to developers and Digital Native
  Enterprises drove exceptional results in 2025 for our growing base of 640K+ customers
  globally. As we push the boundaries of the cloud in 2026, we’ve built a Total Rewards
  program that recognizes individual impact and ensures that Sharks have what they
  need to thrive. Whether you’re working from one of our offices in Hyderabad, Karachi,
  Santa Clara, or Denver , or contributing remotely from home, our flexible policies
  are built for a global workforce. We rigorously benchmark our compensation to ensure
  we remain competitive, giving you the security and motivation to do the best work
  of your career. At DigitalOcean, community spirit starts within our own ‘tank,’
  where Sharks build meaningful relationships and take deep pride in our shared mission.
  Our impact ripples far beyond our internal Slack channels. We are a global force,
  and in 2025, we proved it by hosting Wavemaker Meetups and engaging in countless
  major developer events worldwide - from FounderCon to RAISE Summit to our own marquee
  event, Deploy. As we move through 2026, we are taking that connection to the next
  level and leading our community through the AI revolution. Through viral starter
  apps, native integrations, and high-impact digital content, we’re giving developers
  the blueprints to build the future. By doubling down on our digital presence, we’re
  ensuring that every developer - and every Shark - has the resources to build what’s
  next.'
