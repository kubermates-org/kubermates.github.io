  to each Kubernetes minor version, starting with VKr 1.34. We previously announced
  24 months of support for vSphere Kubernetes release (VKr) 1.33 in June 2025. This
  change provides platform teams with greater stability and flexibility when planning
  upgrades. VKS 3.5 also brings several improvements to operational consistency and
  lifecycle management, including fine-grained configuration controls for core Kubernetes
  components, a declarative add-on management model, and integrated support-bundle
  generation directly from the VCF CLI. Additionally, new upgrade guardrails—such
  as PodDisruptionBudget validation and compatibility checks—help ensure safer, more
  predictable cluster upgrades. Together, these enhancements improve reliability,
  operational efficiency, and Day-2 management for Kubernetes environments at scale.
  VKS 3.5 enables support for VKr 1.34. Every vSphere Kubernetes minor version is
  now supported for 24 months from its release date. This reduces upgrade pressure,
  stabilizes environments, and frees up teams to focus on delivering value instead
  of constantly planning upgrades. Teams that want quick access to the latest Kubernetes
  features can stay current with new releases. Those that prefer to run on a stable
  version for longer can now do so with confidence. VKS 3.5 supports both operating
  models.'
