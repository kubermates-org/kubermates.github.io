  Applications Virtualization Share The biggest challenge for disaster recovery in
  traditional environments is that every environment looks and feels different. If
  you''re moving from a colo that someone manages to VMware, the cloud, or a different
  VMware data center, they all look and feel different. Even if you''re using the
  same virtualization provider, storage is probably handled differently. There has
  to be a lot of planning and strategy around how to copy data from one area to another
  since that’s not something natively built into your virtualization provider. You
  also have to figure out networking, DNS, routing, etc. With Red Hat OpenShift ,
  all of these components are software-defined. You get software-defined DNS, networking,
  and storage layers all because it’s based on Kubernetes. Out-of-the-box OpenShift
  won’t “automagically” failover without additional levels of configuration, much
  like VMware or other traditional infrastructure environments. But the tools required
  are mostly there for you, either pre-packaged and open-source or robustly tested
  and a standard in the space.'
