  Virtualization Share Rising virtualization costs, licensing constraints, and operational
  complexity are driving teams to evaluate more flexible and cost-effective paths
  to the cloud. Red Hat OpenShift Virtualization, combined with Red Hat OpenShift
  Service on AWS (ROSA), supports hardware overcommit in the cloud, allowing customers
  to run more virtual machines (VMs) on fewer cloud resources. By aligning resource
  consumption more closely to actual usage patterns, organizations can significantly
  reduce compute costs. This provides a practical way to consolidate VM footprints
  and maximize the value of cloud investments. Customers can also take advantage of
  AWS buying programs to further improve cost efficiency. ROSA supports pay-as-you-go
  pricing, the use of existing AWS cloud committed spend agreements, reserved instances,
  savings plans and, of course, unified billing. These options offer multiple paths
  to align OpenShift consumption with financial planning strategies and help organizations
  convert Red Hat software and managed site reliability engineering (SRE) services
  into predictable, planned expenditures. Operational efficiency is another key benefit.
  ROSA is jointly supported by Red Hat and AWS, and Red Hat SRE teams manage the day-to-day
  operations of the service. This includes upgrades, monitoring, scaling, and incident
  response. Offloading these activities can help reduce infrastructure management
  efforts and free teams to focus on delivering applications, accelerating time to
  value. For organizations adopting AI and GPU-accelerated workloads, ROSA offers
  additional scalability and cost advantages when compared to on-premise environments.
