  Units (DPUs) represent a significant evolution in datacenter architecture. By offloading
  infrastructure tasks like networking, security, and storage from the main CPU, they
  promise to unlock new levels of cloud capabilities. Red Hat OpenShift 4.20 delivers
  a major breakthrough in solving the primary challenge of DPU adoption: vendor lock-in.
  This new capability provides unified, vendor-agnostic support for different DPUs,
  all within a single cluster. This is the result of our focused, standards-based
  strategy. We began this journey by introducing tech preview support for the first
  DPU (the Intel IPU) in Red Hat OpenShift 4.19. By building on the open standards
  of the Open Programmable Infrastructure (OPI) project, our work for the 4.20 release
  has expanded this to include 2 additional DPUs: the Senao SX904 (Intel NetSec Accelerator)
  and the Marvell Octeon 10. This directly addresses the industry''s largest DPU challenge:
  the fragmented landscape. Until now, organizations have been forced into isolated,
  vendor-specific environments, each with proprietary tools, drivers, and APIs. This
  approach eliminates that fragmentation. As we''ve discussed in cloud-native enablement
  of DPUs , our goal is to make DPUs a smoothly integrated and abstracted component
  of Red Hat OpenShift. Our integration work is centered on a standard Red Hat OpenShift
  cluster.'
