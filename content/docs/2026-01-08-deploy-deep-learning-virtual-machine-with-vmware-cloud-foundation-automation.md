  Deep Learning Virtual Machine with VMware Cloud Foundation Automation The New Paradigm:
  MLPerf Inference 5.1 Confirms VCF is the Future of AI/ML Performance Enterprise
  customers can now deploy NVIDIA Run:ai on VMware Cloud Foundation Data scientists
  and ML/Ops engineers often face a significant hurdle: the time-consuming and complex
  task of setting up the necessary infrastructure for their core work, such as AI
  prototyping, fine-tuning, and validation. This is a burden they are not technically
  equipped to handle. VMware Private AI Foundation with NVIDIA addresses this by providing
  deep learning virtual machine images. These images come preconfigured with popular
  ML libraries, frameworks, and toolkits, and are optimized and validated by VMware
  and NVIDIA for GPU acceleration in a VMware Cloud Foundation (VCF) environment.
  This joint validation significantly reduces the time required for installing, configuring,
  and validating essential workloads. Furthermore, these images can be offered to
  your users as self-service catalog items, freeing up infrastructure administration
  time previously spent on these tasks. The deployment process is also simplified
  and accelerated, from hours to minutes, through VCF Automation, as demonstrated
  in the video below. To learn about the latest updates to the deep learning virtual
  machine images, you can refer to the official release notes.'
