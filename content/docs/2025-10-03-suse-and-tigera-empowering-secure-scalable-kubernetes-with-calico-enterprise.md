summary: 'Modern Workloads Demand Modern Kubernetes Infrastructure Comprehensive Security
  Without Compromise Resilience and Visibility at Scale Operational Simplicity for
  Platform Teams Open Source Roots, Enterprise Strength Choice Backed by Enterprise
  Support The Path Forward As organizations expand Kubernetes adoption—modernizing
  legacy applications on VMs and bare metal, running next-generation AI workloads,
  and deploying intelligence at the edge—the demand for infrastructure that is scalable,
  flexible, resilient, secure, and performant has never been greater. At the same
  time, compliance, consistent visibility, and efficient management without overburdening
  teams remain critical. The combination of Calico Enterprise from Tigera and SUSE
  Rancher Prime delivers a resilient and scalable platform that combines high-performance
  networking, robust network security, and operational simplicity in one stack. Calico
  Enterprise provides a unified platform for Kubernetes networking, security, and
  observability: eBPF-powered networking for high performance without sidecar overhead
  One platform for all Kubernetes traffic: ingress, egress, in-cluster, and multi-cluster
  Security for every workload type: containers, VMs, and bare metal Seamless scaling
  with built-in multi-cluster networking and security Zero-trust security with identity-aware
  policies and workload-based microsegmentation Integrated observability for policy
  enforcement and troubleshooting Compliance features that simplify audits (PCI-DSS,
  HIPAA, SOC 2, FedRAMP) Deployed with Rancher Prime, these capabilities extend directly
  into every cluster, enabling security-conscious industries such as finance, healthcare,
  and government to confidently run Kubernetes for any use case—from application modernization
  to AI and edge computing. Modern enterprises run Kubernetes across multiple clusters,
  regions, and clouds. Rancher Prime simplifies and unifies this landscape, while
  Calico Enterprise adds: Highly available and resilient networking designed for mission-critical
  applications Standardized networking and network security controls across multiple
  clusters, regions, and clouds Centralized network policy and compliance enforcement
  across all clusters Dynamic service discovery and adaptive network controls Rich
  observability, including real-time flow logs and network performance metrics This
  combination gives Site Reliability Engineering (SRE) and DevSecOps teams the visibility
  they need to prevent outages, detect threats faster, and reduce downtime — even
  in complex multi-cloud topologies. Rancher Prime acts as the single pane of glass
  for cluster lifecycle management, while Calico Enterprise integrates seamlessly
  to provide a single pane of glass for network security, observability and troubleshooting
  with minimal operational burden. Together, they deliver a frictionless experience
  for platform teams : unified deployment, automated policy propagation, and security
  guardrails baked into the platform — not bolted on after the fact. Both SUSE and
  Tigera are committed to open innovation and customer choice. Calico, the open-source
  foundation of Calico Enterprise, is trusted by thousands of organizations and runs
  on more than 100,000 clusters worldwide. Rancher Prime is fully open source as well,
  backed by enterprise SLAs and global support from SUSE. Enterprises can modernize
  their infrastructure without lock-in, accelerating time-to-value for developers
  while staying in control of security and compliance.'
