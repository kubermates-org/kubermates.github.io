tldr: With Kubernetes 1.
summary: With Kubernetes 1. 32, the memory manager has officially graduated to General
  Availability (GA), marking a significant milestone in the journey toward efficient
  and predictable memory allocation for containerized applications. Since Kubernetes
  v1. 22, where it graduated to beta, the memory manager has proved itself reliable,
  stable and a good complementary feature for the CPU Manager. As part of kubelet's
  workload admission process, the memory manager provides topology hints to optimize
  memory allocation and alignment. This enables users to allocate exclusive memory
  for Pods in the Guaranteed QoS class.
