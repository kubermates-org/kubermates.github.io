summary: 'In traditional apps â€” whether Node. js, Python, Java, or others â€” youâ€™ve
  probably done this before: And sometimesâ€¦ you (accidentally or lazily) hardcode
  passwords into the code itself. ðŸ˜¬ But in Kubernetes, thereâ€™s a better and safer
  way to do this. Enter: ConfigMaps and Secrets It keeps your app configs separate
  from your app code and container image â€” which is great for flexibility and security.
  Secrets are base64-encoded and can be managed with tighter access controls in Kubernetes.
  You: And a Secret: Then, in your Pod spec (simplified YAML): ðŸ‘‰ Use the KodeKloud
  Kubernetes Playground 1 - Create a Secret: 2 - Create a Pod using that secret: Apply
  it with: Youâ€™ll see the password securely injected. Imagine youâ€™re deploying an
  app on a shared team server. ðŸ“… Day 7: Your Kubernetes Learning Roadmap â€” Whatâ€™s
  Next After the Basics? Youâ€™ll get: New here? Start from Day 1 and catch up on the
  series: Day 1: What Is Kubernetes & Why Should You Care? Discover why Kubernetes
  matters and how it changes the game. Day 2: What Are Pods in Kubernetes? Understand
  the smallest deployable unit in Kubernetes. Day 3: Understanding Nodes, Clusters
  & the Kubernetes Control Plane See how all the pieces connect behind the scenes.
  Day 4: Deployments & ReplicaSets â€” How Kubernetes Runs and Manages Your App âš™Learn
  how Kubernetes keeps your apps running smoothly. Day 5: Kubernetes Services â€” How
  Your App Gets a Stable IP or URL Discover how Services expose and connect your app
  reliably.'
