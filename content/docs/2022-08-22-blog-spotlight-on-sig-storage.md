tldr: Spotlight on SIG Storage About SIG Storage Storage and Kubernetes Ongoing challenges
  Community involvement Since the very beginning of Kubernetes, the topic of persistent
  data and how to address the requirement of stateful applications has been an important
  topic. Support for stateless deployments was natural, present from the start, and
  garnered attention, becoming very well-known.
summary: 'Spotlight on SIG Storage About SIG Storage Storage and Kubernetes Ongoing
  challenges Community involvement Since the very beginning of Kubernetes, the topic
  of persistent data and how to address the requirement of stateful applications has
  been an important topic. Support for stateless deployments was natural, present
  from the start, and garnered attention, becoming very well-known. Work on better
  support for stateful applications was also present from early on, with each release
  increasing the scope of what could be run on Kubernetes. Message queues, databases,
  clustered filesystems: these are some examples of the solutions that have different
  storage requirements and that are, today, increasingly deployed in Kubernetes. Dealing
  with ephemeral and persistent storage, local or remote, file or block, from many
  different vendors, while considering how to provide the needed resiliency and data
  consistency that users expect, all of this is under SIG Storage’s umbrella. In this
  SIG Storage spotlight, Frederico Muñoz (Cloud & Architecture Lead at SAS) talked
  with Xing Yang , Tech Lead at VMware and co-chair of SIG Storage, on how the SIG
  is organized, what are the current challenges and how anyone can get involved and
  contribute. Frederico (FSM) : Hello, thank you for the opportunity of learning more
  about SIG Storage. Could you tell us a bit about yourself, your role, and how you
  got involved in SIG Storage. Xing Yang (XY) : I am a Tech Lead at VMware, working
  on Cloud Native Storage. I am also a Co-Chair of SIG Storage. I started to get involved
  in K8s SIG Storage at the end of 2017, starting with contributing to the VolumeSnapshot
  project. At that time, the VolumeSnapshot project was still in an experimental,
  pre-alpha stage.'
