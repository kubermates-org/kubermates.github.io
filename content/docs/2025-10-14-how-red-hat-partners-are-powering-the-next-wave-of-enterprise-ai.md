  Edge computing Infrastructure Applications Virtualization Share The pace of AI innovation
  is accelerating, and with the launch of Red Hat AI 3 , we're reminded that turning
  this potential into enterprise reality requires a robust, open ecosystem built on
  choice and collaboration. Our goal has always been to provide a consistent, powerful
  platform for AI that works with any model, on any accelerator, and across the hybrid
  cloud. Today, we're thrilled to highlight the momentum from our partners, who are
  working alongside us to build out the future of open, hybrid AI on Red Hat. The
  Red Hat partner ecosystem is the engine that will deliver the generative AI (gen
  AI) and agentic capabilities that customers need for broad market adoption. It’s
  about bringing together the best in hardware, software, and services to create a
  whole that is far greater than the sum of its parts. The launch of Red Hat AI 3
  is centered on driving enterprise AI inference, expanding model choice and enabling
  open models for optimized cost and flexibility – so organizations can go from training
  to “doing. ” And Red Hat partners play a critical role in making this happen. To
  deliver AI inference at scale using vLLM and Kubernetes, the llm-d open source project
  is now generally available as part of Red Hat OpenShift AI 3.0, powered by a coalition
  of leading gen AI model providers, AI accelerators and premier AI cloud platforms.
  Founding contributors include CoreWeave, Google Cloud, IBM Research, and NVIDIA,
  with additional support from partners like AMD, Cisco, Hugging Face, Intel, Lambda,
  and Mistral AI. Since the project’s introduction earlier this year, Microsoft, Oracle
  and WEKA have also become active contributing members. As Large Language Models
  (LLMs) become the foundation for a wide range of gen AI applications, Red Hat is
  introducing the Partner Model Validation Guide to empower our partners and provide
  greater choice to customers. This guide outlines a standardized, step-by-step process
  for Red Hat partners to benchmark their LLMs for inclusion in the Red Hat OpenShift
  AI model catalog.
