  Hat is excited to announce the release of Red Hat OpenShift sandboxed containers
  1.11 and Red Hat build of Trustee 1.0, marking a significant milestone in our confidential
  computing journey. These releases bring production-grade support for confidential
  containers in Microsoft Azure Red Hat OpenShift and introduce technology preview
  support for bare metal environments with Intel TDX and AMD SEV-SNP processors. Organizations
  can now protect their most sensitive workloads with hardware-based memory encryption
  and attestation capabilities across cloud and on-premises infrastructure. Across
  both cloud and bare metal, OpenShift sandboxed containers 1.11 introduces features
  that harden your security posture and improve usability. Secure by default : We
  are implementing a new restrictive agent policy by default. This policy blocks host-level
  commands like oc exec for confidential containers, providing true isolation from
  the administrator. A debug mode can be enabled via a pod annotation for development.
  oc exec Trusted supply chain : We''ve enhanced support for signed container images,
  a critical part of a trusted software supply chain. Secure secret release : A key
  value of attestation is the secure delivery of secrets. Red Hat build of Trustee
  is used to verify the integrity of a pod before releasing sensitive data, like database
  credentials or private keys. Such secrets are retrieved from the attestation service.
  Improved supportability : We have improved our must-gather tooling to automatically
  collect Trustee logs, making it easier for our support teams to help you troubleshoot
  attestation workflows.'
