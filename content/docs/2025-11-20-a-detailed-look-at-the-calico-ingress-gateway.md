  for Calico Ingress Gateway Conclusion: Preparing for a Post–Ingress NGINX World
  The Kubernetes community recently announced that Ingress NGINX, one of the most
  widely used Ingress controllers, will be retired. This change means teams need to
  plan for a secure, modern, and future-proof alternative for managing Kubernetes
  traffic. The Kubernetes SIG Network and the Security Response Committee confirmed
  that the project will only receive basic maintenance until March 2026. After that,
  there will be no new releases, bug fixes, or security updates. For organizations
  that have depended on Ingress NGINX for many years, this is more than a routine
  update. It represents a major change in how Kubernetes ingress traffic will need
  to be managed going forward. This raises an important question: What should replace
  Ingress NGINX in a way that is secure, modern, standardized, and reliable for the
  long term? As the industry moves toward the Kubernetes Gateway API and expectations
  for security and reliability grow, this is the right time to adopt an ingress solution
  designed for the future. Calico Ingress Gateway is a 100% upstream distribution
  of the Envoy Gateway, supported by Tigera’s enterprise expertise, and offers a smooth
  and dependable path forward. Managing traffic in Kubernetes environments presents
  serious security and operational challenges. Traditional ingress solutions lack
  flexibility, rely on proprietary configurations, and offer limited traffic control,
  creating security gaps and inefficiencies. What’s needed is a more flexible, scalable,
  and policy-driven approach to ingress traffic management. Enter Calico Ingress Gateway—built
  to eliminate these limitations while enhancing security, visibility, and control
  over ingress traffic at scale.'
