summary: 'From maintenance to enablement: Making your platform a force‑multiplier
  Where things stand From estate to experience Three mindset shifts that change outcomes
  1. Platform‑as‑a‑Product (not a toolbox) 2. Ambassador practices (not a ticket queue)
  3. Developer experience, designed Actionable insights: A 30‑day starter sprint What

  the platform team vanished tomorrow, what would developers miss: The tools, or the
  feeling that getting work done was straightforward and safe? Many organisations
  run platforms that look healthy: Uptime holds, pipelines run, dashboards glow green.
  Yet delivery still drags, tickets stack up, teams build side‑doors around "the system.
  " Wins exist, but they''re invisible. The problem isn’t reliability, it''s the experience
  of shipping. The answer is a practical shift: Treat the platform like a product
  that enables people. Ship changes like product teams do, design one clear delivery
  path, and turn governance into sensible defaults that generate evidence as work
  happens. Who this is for: Platform, engineering, and risk leaders who need speed
  and safety, particularly in regulated environments. What you''ll take away: Three
  mindset shifts, a 30‑day starter sprint, a handful of useful metrics, and ways to
  make governance feel like clarity, not ceremony. Maintenance has plateaued.'
