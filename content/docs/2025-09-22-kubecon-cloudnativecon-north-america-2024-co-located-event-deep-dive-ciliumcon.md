tldr: 'What do you want attendees to get out of this event? What is new and different
  this year? What will the day look like? Should I do any homework first? Meet your

  Bill Mulligan and Hemanth Malla CNCF projects highlighted in this post CiliumCon
  began at KubeCon + CloudNativeCon Europe 2023 in Amsterdam, and this will be our

  Bill Mulligan and Hemanth Malla CNCF projects highlighted in this post CiliumCon
  began at KubeCon + CloudNativeCon Europe 2023 in Amsterdam, and this will be our
  sixth time hosting it. Like Cilium itself, the event has grown significantly since
  its inception, expanding from its original focus to now include Hubble and Tetragon
  too. There might even be some nods to scaling networking for the needs of AI. CiliumCon
  is where the Cilium and eBPF community comes together to share real-world experiences
  and learn from each other. It’s a space to meet the Github handles you have been
  working with or following the whole year and who knows, you might even walk away
  with an eBee. Platform teams will walk away with the knowledge on everything from
  implementing Cilium Mesh in production environments to advanced DNS policy management
  to multi-cluster security strategies and running IPv6 only Kubernetes clusters.
  Seasoned contributors will learn if it’s actually possible to parse DNS in the kernel
  and everyone will help build the buzz around Cilium. This year, we are celebrating
  almost 10 years of Cilium! As the project has matured, we’re able to feature the
  experience of a decade of production implementations. Attendees will hear how CiliumEndpointSlice
  helped Microsoft unlock higher scale at AKS, SeatGeek’s journey from zero to production
  in 90 days with Cilium Mesh, ESnet’s pioneering IPv6-first Kubernetes deployment,
  and Google’s multi-cluster network security strategies with Cilium, Tetragon, and
  Hubble. We’re also diving deep into kernel-level DNS parsing improvements and will
  learn how to solve a real-world bug in Cilium’s BPF-based SNAT and its LRU eviction
  policy. The CIlium and eBPF community will come together for a half-day on Monday,
  November 10th, from 9:00 AM to 12:30 PM EST. The day will kick off with opening
  remarks from Program Committee Co-Chairs Bill Mulligan and Hemanth Malla, followed
  by six technical sessions, and a keynote from Liz Rice which will cover the broader
  community direction and vision.'
