  Scaling AI workloads shouldn’t require deep expertise in distributed systems and
  container orchestration. Whether you are prototyping on local hardware or deploying
  to a production Kubernetes cluster, you need a unified API that abstracts infrastructure
  complexity while preserving flexibility. That’s exactly what the Kubeflow Python
  SDK delivers. As an AI Practitioner, you’ve probably experienced this frustrating
  journey: you start by prototyping locally, training your model on your laptop. When
  you need more compute power, you have to rewrite everything for distributed training.
  You containerize your code, rebuild images for every small change, write Kubernetes
  YAMLs, wrestle with kubectl, and juggle multiple SDKs — one for training, another
  for hyperparameter tuning, and yet another for pipelines. Each step demands different
  tools, APIs, and mental models. All this complexity slows down productivity, drains
  focus, and ultimately holds back AI innovation. What if there was a better way?
  The Kubeflow community started the Kubeflow SDK & ML Experience Working Group (WG)
  in order to address these challenges. You can find more information about this WG
  on our YouTube playlist. The SDK sits on top of the Kubeflow ecosystem as a unified
  interface layer.'
