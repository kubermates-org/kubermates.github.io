  Share Twenty-eight percent of businesses surveyed in the recent S&P Global Market
  Intelligence 451 Research report, “ The value of a unified automation platform ,”
  responded that their company uses 50-100+ tools that don’t seamlessly integrate.
  This widespread adoption of disparate solutions, often driven by a "do it yourself"
  mentality, can lead to overwhelming tool sprawl. The resulting lack of interoperability
  directly hinders innovation, fragments data insights, and ultimately undermines
  the effective delivery of AI solutions. As automation and AI become increasingly
  interdependent, systems must be capable of cohesive information exchange. This critical
  need points directly to platform engineering (PE), which enables self-service capabilities
  through a, "bidirectional exchange of both data and workflows," between tools. A
  unified automation platform isn''t merely a convenience, it''s the strategic foundation
  for AI development and deployment. Take a moment to evaluate your organization''s
  automation maturity: Are your IT operations bogged down by manual, repetitive tasks
  across various domains: Network, security, cloud, and infrastructure? Do different
  teams (IT Ops, DevOps, SecOps, Network Ops, Line of Business) grapple with inconsistent
  automation tools and processes, fostering silos and inefficiency? Is your current
  automation fragmented, making it challenging to scale or maintain consistency across
  hybrid and multicloud environments? Can you accurately measure the ROI of your automation
  efforts, and pinpoint where automation could deliver the most significant time and
  cost savings? Do you have a clear strategy for integrating emerging technologies
  like AI into your IT operations? Is your automation foundation truly prepared to
  support these initiatives? The next hurdle is effectively articulating the value
  of a unified platform to your stakeholders and decision-makers.'
