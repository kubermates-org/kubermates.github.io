summary: 'Graduation marks Knative’s readiness for widespread production use, with
  upcoming features aimed at bridging legacy systems and expanding AI and cloud native
  integrations Key Highlights: The Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) announced
  the graduation of Knative, a Kubernetes-native serverless and event-driven application
  platform, marking its readiness for widespread production use. Knative removes much
  of the complexity of running modern workloads on Kubernetes by handling infrastructure
  tasks like autoscaling, routing, and event delivery. This helps organizations reduce
  costs, improve efficiency, and accelerate innovation. Developers gain a faster on-ramp
  to Kubernetes; platform teams simplify operations; and enterprises and startups
  alike benefit from easier integration with AI and cloud native technologies. Knative
  is now a graduated CNCF project and is available for production use today. SAN FRANCISCO,
  Calif. – October 8, 2025 – The Cloud Native Computing Foundation® (CNCF®), which
  builds sustainable ecosystems for cloud native software, announced the graduation
  of Knative , a serverless, event-driven application layer on top of Kubernetes.
  Knative simplifies how developers build, deploy, and run modern workloads by abstracting
  the infrastructure concerns such as autoscaling, routing, event delivery, and building
  containers. It allows teams to focus on architecture and business logic and get
  started quickly on Kubernetes without needing to ramp up on dozens of Kubernetes
  concepts and resources. As the C-suite looks to optimize costs and simplify operations,
  Knative can do so with features like autoscaling to zero to minimize infrastructure
  waste. “Knative fills several gaps in the cloud native ecosystem as an easy on-ramp
  to Kubernetes, with Knative’s eventing acting as the missing skeleton for connecting
  events to reactions,” said Evan Anderson, Knative co-founder. “It’s gratifying to
  see the vision that inspired Knative realized and adopted across the CNCF.'
