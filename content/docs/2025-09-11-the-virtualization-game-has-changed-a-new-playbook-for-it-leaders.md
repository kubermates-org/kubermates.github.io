  Edge computing Infrastructure Applications Virtualization Share In today''s business,
  success isn''t just about playing the game–it''s about having the right strategy
  to win. Like a top team constantly adapting its formation to a changing opponent,
  organisations are grappling with complex IT environments, rising costs, and the
  need to modernise for workloads like AI. The question is, how do we find a way forward
  that provides greater control and a clear path to innovation? The answer lies in
  how we approach virtualization. To help leaders understand how the situation has
  shifted, Red Hat released a report on the state of virtualization. It reveals critical
  insights into how forward-thinking organisations are harnessing a unified platform
  for virtualization and containers to become more agile and flexible. I''ve been
  discussing these very topics with our customers, partners, and peers for some time
  now, and the insights in this report are a perfect articulation of what I''ve seen
  firsthand: there is a widespread desire for a new playbook for the future of IT
  infrastructure. Our customers are asking for a platform that drives tangible change
  and positions them for ongoing success. What truly solidifies my understanding of
  the changing virtualization market is the sheer scale of the market movement revealed
  in the report. It''s one thing to know there''s a buzz about change, but it’s another
  to see the data: 70% of organisations have recently moved virtual machine (VM) workloads
  to a different or additional hypervisor—or are in the process of making a switch.
  This isn''t just contemplation, it''s a widespread reassessment of existing platforms
  driven by a fundamental belief that the existing strategy is no longer sufficient.
  Organisations are not just thinking about it, but are actively executing on a new
  virtualization strategy that addresses their primary pain points, including licensing
  costs (31%), and management complexity (31%). Vendor lock-in (28%) and concerns
  about the continued support of existing platforms (27%), along with confidence in
  long-term vision (24%), are also frequent topics.'
