  Share Red Hat and NVIDIA have expanded their collaboration to launch Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux for NVIDIA, a specialized platform designed to provide Day 0 support for the
  NVIDIA Rubin architecture. This partnership aims to industrialize open source AI
  by providing a secure, stable, and unified infrastructure that scales enterprise
  AI workloads across hybrid cloud environments. Learn more NVIDIA CEO Jensen Huang
  announced at CES 2026 that the Vera Rubin next-generation AI platform is in full
  production, with first customer deliveries expected in the second half of the year.
  The company is working with Red Hat to offer more products that will run on the
  new Rubin chip system. Learn more Industry experts predict 2026 will be the breakout
  year for AI inference as the market shifts from massive centralized training to
  discrete, real-time production workloads like agentic AI and edge computing. This
  evolution has sparked intense competition between established hyperscalers and specialized
  neoclouds, as well as hardware and storage providers racing to optimize the infrastructure
  required for continuous, data-centric AI operations. Learn more Turning an AI demo
  into a production-ready business asset requires a fundamental shift in strategy.
  While massive frontier models drive hype, a sustainable production architecture
  is built on a diverse toolbox of specialized, cost-effective models. Learn how to
  build a production-ready "AI Toolbox" on this episode of Technically Speaking. Learn
  more The AI industry's current marketing relies on manufactured urgency and fear,
  which often pushes leaders toward black box solutions instead of sustainable strategies.
  To counter this, the author advocates for a foundation of transparency and deliberate
  planning in infrastructure and data governance, asserting that long-term success
  comes from building systems that are understandable and stable rather than just
  moving fast.
