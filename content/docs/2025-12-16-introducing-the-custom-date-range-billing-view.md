  If you’ve ever stared at an unexpected cloud bill spike and sifted through invoices
  trying to find the cause, you know how time-consuming cost investigations can be.
  Until now, identifying cost anomalies often meant waiting for your monthly invoice
  or manually calculating month-to-date usage. That changes today. All DigitalOcean
  customers now have access to the new custom date range billing view. This new feature
  is accessible in the Billing Console by going to Billing → Insights. Additionally,
  you can download your report as a CSV so you can view your granular billing insights
  offline. This update gives you clearer, more granular visibility into your cloud
  costs (segmented into daily, weekly, and monthly spend by product) making budgeting
  and forecasting far easier. DevOps, Finance, and growing teams can now manage spend
  proactively instead of reacting after the fact. For all customers, this feature
  is available globally and fully self-service via the Cloud Console and API. Here
  is a close look into the features of this new billing view: Custom date range filtering:
  You are no longer limited to invoices for viewing your spending. Choose any start
  and end date to view total spend for that exact range. This makes it easy to align
  cloud costs with development sprints, project timelines, or product launches–and
  improves internal chargebacks and budgeting accuracy.'
