  Infrastructure Applications Virtualization Share The State of Missouri serves millions
  of people digitally every year, offering a range of services from motor vehicle
  registrations and various state licenses to health and social benefits and resident
  support. These citizen services require significant operational rigor, driven by
  an IT organization focused on delivering technology with speed, consistency, and
  efficiency. Before adopting Red Hat Ansible Automation Platform, the State of Missouri’s
  IT landscape was a mix of disparate IT automation products, leading to a sprawling
  and disconnected environment and a number of resulting pain points. For the engineering
  team, it meant dealing with a variety of tools, a lack of standardization, and an
  inability to easily share and collaborate on work across the organization. Across
  departments, critical tasks could take hours or even days to complete manually,
  increasing the risk of human error and delaying the delivery of services. Recognizing
  that this approach wasn't sustainable, the state adopted Ansible Automation Platform
  to centralize automation efforts with a dedicated team to support it. As the team
  began rolling out this platform, certain requirements had to be met. First, the
  team tackled a widespread concern of how to integrate a sensitive password and certificate
  management solutions into the new automation. Instead of creating a new process,
  they built a custom Ansible Content Collection that connects to their existing secrets
  repository that includes modules and roles to more securely call sensitive data.
  They approved and stored this new custom collection in their private automation
  hub instance – allowing them to organize and control recommended automation assets
  like this for use across the IT organization. With testing complete, they were ready
  to use it. This readily available custom Ansible Content Collection made a huge
  impact in their organization, providing other teams with a sense of comfort and
  overcoming their hesitancy to adopt automation.
