  started with EKS Auto Mode Conclusion About the authors When we launched Amazon
  Elastic Kubernetes Service (Amazon EKS) Auto Mode at Amazon Web Services (AWS) re:Invent
  2024, we introduced a transformative approach to Kubernetes cluster management on
  AWS. EKS Auto Mode fully automates Kubernetes cluster management for compute, storage,
  and networking, so that you can focus on building applications that drive innovation
  rather than managing cluster infrastructure. EKS Auto Mode addresses a fundamental
  challenge: although users choose Amazon EKS for the open standards of Kubernetes
  combined with the capabilities of AWS, they often struggle with the operational
  complexity of production-grade infrastructure. Managing compute provisioning, maintaining
  essential plugins for autoscaling, storage, and networking, handling OS patches,
  and optimizing resource utilization all require significant ongoing effort that
  takes focus away from the kind of innovation that their users want. EKS Auto Mode
  handles the complete Kubernetes cluster infrastructure lifecycle through five key
  capabilities: Automated compute management : Intelligent node provisioning, scaling,
  and lifecycle management that adapts to workload demands without manual intervention.
  Integrated networking and storage : Pre-configured Amazon Virtual Private Cloud
  (Amazon VPC) CNI, Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS ) CSI drivers, and load
  balancer controllers that work together seamlessly from day one Secure and optimized
  compute runtime: Enforced encryption, automated patching, and secure access management
  that maintains compliance without operational overhead. Built-in cost optimization
  : Automatic instance type selection, Spot integration, and right-sizing that continuously
  optimizes spend based on actual usage patterns. Simplified cluster lifecycle : One-click
  cluster creation and updates that handle the complexity of Kubernetes version management
  and component compatibility This foundation has enabled many customers, from large
  enterprises to scaling startups, to shift cluster operations to AWS, freeing up
  valuable time and energy on their teams while retaining full Kubernetes interoperability.
  Teams can deploy production workloads faster, achieve better performance outcomes,
  and reduce infrastructure costs without needing specialized Kubernetes expertise.
  Since launch, we’ve been expanding Auto Mode’s capabilities based on our customers’
  feedback and real-world usage patterns. This post covers the features and improvements
  we’ve delivered to address specific operational challenges and extend the functionality
  of EKS Auto Mode for diverse workloads. Over the past 10 months, we’ve delivered
  a steady stream of enhancements that expand the capabilities of EKS Auto Mode and
  address diverse customer requirements: Optimized node lifecycle management : EKS
  Auto Mode has significantly improved cluster scaling performance through several
  key enhancements.'
