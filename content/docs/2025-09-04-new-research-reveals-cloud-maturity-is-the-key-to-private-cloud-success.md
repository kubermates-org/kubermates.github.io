  Cloud Foundation Environments Today, we’re excited to announce the release of our
  special edition report: “ Private Cloud Outlook: The Maturity Advantage. ” The research
  reveals a pivotal shift in how enterprises approach cloud strategy—and uncovers
  a critical success factor that separates high-performing organizations from the
  rest. Enterprises are fundamentally rethinking their cloud strategies, placing private
  cloud at the center to address today’s most pressing business challenges. While
  security, cost control, and data governance remain primary drivers, our research
  shows that private cloud has evolved into a powerful enabler for modern workloads,
  including AI initiatives. But here’s what’s truly fascinating: the benefits of private
  cloud aren’t just about the technology—they are about deployment maturity which
  also brings along people and process. When we analyzed responses through the lens
  of cloud maturity, a striking pattern emerged that reveals why some enterprises
  are pulling dramatically ahead of their peers. Enterprises that are mature in their
  cloud journey experience significantly superior results in strategic impact and
  operational excellence. They are investing in their infrastructure to drive business
  goals: 59% are increasing their private cloud investments, compared to 38% of developing-stage
  peers 60% rank private cloud workloads as their top IT priority, compared to 41%
  of developing-stage peers 90%+ report satisfaction in infrastructure operations,
  application deployment, security and compliance, compared to 50-65% satisfaction
  for developing-stage peers Perhaps most telling is the workload repatriation trend
  we discovered. Mature enterprises are 3x more likely to have repatriated workloads
  from public cloud , with 50% having brought modern, cloud-native applications back
  to private infrastructure. This isn’t about reversing failed migrations—it’s a deliberate,
  strategic move driven by heightened security concerns, rising costs, and the growing
  demands of modern workloads like AI. Our research identified six critical dimensions
  that determine cloud maturity progress across people, process and technology: Workload
  diversity – Successfully running both traditional and modern applications Self-service
  provisioning – Enabling tenant self-provisioning via catalogs and APIs Policy-based
  guardrails – Implementing automated governance for security and compliance Cost
  transparency – Providing chargeback/showback information to internal customers Platform
  model – Organizing around platform teams vs.'
