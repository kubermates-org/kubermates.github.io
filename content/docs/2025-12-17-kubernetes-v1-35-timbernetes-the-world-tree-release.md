  Crowell, Graziano Casto, Swathi Rao Similar to previous releases, the release of
  Kubernetes v1.35 introduces new stable, beta, and alpha features. The consistent
  delivery of high-quality releases underscores the strength of our development cycle
  and the vibrant support from our community. This release consists of 60 enhancements,
  including 17 stable, 19 beta, and 22 alpha features. There are also some deprecations
  and removals in this release; make sure to read about those. 2025 began in the shimmer
  of Octarine: The Color of Magic (v1.33) and rode the gusts Of Wind & Will (v1.34).
  We close the year with our hands on the World Tree, inspired by Yggdrasil, the tree
  of life that binds many realms. Like any great tree, Kubernetes grows ring by ring
  and release by release, shaped by the care of a global community. At its center
  sits the Kubernetes wheel wrapped around the Earth, grounded by the resilient maintainers,
  contributors and users who keep showing up. Between day jobs, life changes, and
  steady open-source stewardship, they prune old APIs, graft new features and keep
  one of the world’s largest open source projects healthy.'
