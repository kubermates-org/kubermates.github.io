  Have you ever wondered how to set up a cluster of thousands of nodes just in seconds,
  how to simulate real nodes with a low resource footprint, and how to test your Kubernetes
  controller at scale without spending much on infrastructure? If you answered “yes”
  to any of these questions, then you might be interested in KWOK, a toolkit that
  enables you to create a cluster of thousands of nodes in seconds. KWOK stands for
  Kubernetes WithOut Kubelet. So far, it provides two tools: KWOK has several advantages:
  KWOK can be used for various purposes: KWOK is not intended to replace others completely.
  It has some limitations that you should be aware of: If you are interested in trying
  out KWOK, please check its documents for more details. Using kwokctl to manage simulated
  clusters If you’re interested in participating in future discussions or development
  related to KWOK, there are several ways to get involved: We welcome feedback and
  contributions from anyone who wants to join us in this exciting project.'
