  Applications Virtualization Share In many open source communities, there’s a fair
  amount of skepticism around the use of generative AI (gen AI) tools for contribution
  and development. There are valid reasons for concern. Our goal in this article,
  and in Red Hat''s own practice, is to address those concerns directly and not dismiss
  them. Our answers aren''t just advice for others—they enable our own engineers,
  most of whom are open source contributors as well. We''ll share with you the guidelines
  we''ve established for Red Hat engineers, based on our use of open source principles
  in practice. But first, we''d like to put the current wave of new tools into context.
  For the last 4 decades, we''ve been regularly implementing new and improved tools
  and processes for software development. You name it: Compilers, version control
  systems, IDEs, virtual machines (both kinds), cloud instances, agile development,
  containers, configuration management, and automated testing. Every set of tools
  was once new, and many of them triggered heated arguments about authorship, quality,
  and legitimacy. There was a time when both compiler flags and auto-complete in IDEs
  were hot-button issues. AI-based development tooling is no different. Nor should
  it be.'
