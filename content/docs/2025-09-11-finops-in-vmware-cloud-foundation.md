  VMware Private AI on HGX servers with Broadcom Ethernet Networking Unlocking the
  Power of GenAI Cloud costs are no longer just for IT finance analysts—cost management
  is a core part across IT operations. VMware Cloud Foundation (VCF) brings together
  private cloud infrastructure with FinOps principles to help ensure financial accountability,
  operational visibility, and business alignment for all IT users. The FinOps framework
  in VCF enables enterprises to not only provision infrastructure but also optimize,
  govern, and allocate costs intelligently across developers and providers. In an
  era where IT infrastructure costs are rapidly escalating, particularly with the
  rise of AI initiatives, enterprise organizations demand greater control and visibility
  over their expenditures. This necessitates not only refined service metering and
  billing, but also the ability to accurately capture and view the Total Cost of Ownership
  (TCO) and overall expenses. Concurrently, IT teams face the challenge of optimizing
  infrastructure to reduce costs and promote resource reuse, while also refining service
  metering and billing for a diverse array of modern services, including VMs, AI services,
  database services, Kubernetes services, and storage services. VCF cost management
  monitors and controls infrastructure spend by improving transparency, enabling cost
  governance, and supporting accurate budgeting. Delivered through a single pane of
  glass, VCF enables cost visibility, analysis, budgeting, optimization, and ROI insights
  while enabling showback for transparency and chargeback with customizable billing
  models—empowering enterprises to manage expenses, ensure accountability, and compare
  costs against public cloud efficiently. VMware Cloud Foundation (VCF) brings robust
  chargeback capabilities that cater to the unique needs of both enterprises and cloud
  service providers. For enterprises, VCF enables internal IT teams to bill back projects
  and application groups based on the resources they consume, creating financial accountability
  and promoting efficient usage. On the other hand, cloud service providers can leverage
  the same framework to track, meter, and charge tenants for the services delivered,
  ensuring fairness and transparency. By combining metering with data- and logic-backed
  billing, VCF empowers providers to generate accurate, itemized bills while giving
  consumers confidence that they are only paying for what they use.
