  Virtualization Share Are you excited to try out post-quantum cryptography in Red
  Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) , but you haven't yet upgraded to RHEL 10? Our efforts
  to ensure that you're ready to make the switch, and to prepare your organization
  for "Q-Day", now start with RHEL 9.7. By getting started now, you can proactively
  begin strengthening your security posture and preparing for a seamless transition
  to RHEL 10. RHEL 9 was released in 2022 and was an important step forward from a
  security perspective. It was the first version of RHEL that received FIPS 140-3
  certification, matching current security requirements. However, a lot has happened
  since 2022. Security requirements have changed, and the era of post-quantum cryptography
  has arrived. For the sake of performance and stability, these new cryptographic
  algorithms can't be backported to earlier versions of most software the way many
  organizations have come to expect. Upgrading software today to bring continued stability,
  functionality, and protection in the post-quantum era is a must, and RHEL 9.7 can
  be your first step. RHEL 9.7 is a crucial stepping stone for your post-quantum transition.
  It gives you the opportunity to gain practical experience with post-quantum cryptography,
  and to understand its implications for your specific workloads. You can also identify
  any necessary application or infrastructure adjustments before you undertake a full
  upgrade to RHEL 10, which offers the most comprehensive post-quantum cryptography
  implementation. A sudden, forced transition to post-quantum cryptography when quantum
  threats become imminent (Q-Day, currently estimated at 2030) could disrupt your
  business's operations.
