summary: 'Your Kubernetes Egress Security Checklist Step 1: Establish a Strong Default
  Security Baseline Step 2: Build Scalable, Precise Policies Step 3: Manage Outbound
  IPs with Egress Gateways Step 4: Govern, Validate, and Monitor Policies Step 5:
  Take the Next Step Securing what comes into your Kubernetes cluster often gets top
  billing. But what leaves your cluster, outbound or egress traffic, can be just as
  risky. A single compromised pod can exfiltrate data, connect to malicious servers,
  or propagate threats across your network. Without proper egress controls, workloads
  can reach untrusted destinations, creating serious security and compliance risks.
  This guide breaks down five practical steps to strengthen Kubernetes egress security,
  helping teams protect data, enforce policies, and maintain visibility across clusters.
  By default, Kubernetes allows unrestricted outbound communication, meaning any pod
  can reach any external destination and dramatically increase the attack surface.
  Implementing egress controls ensures pods can communicate only with explicitly trusted
  services, containing the impact of a compromised workload and preventing unauthorized
  data exfiltration or lateral movement. Granular egress controls are also essential
  for meeting security and compliance mandates, providing authorization, logging,
  and monitoring for all external connections. To help teams tackle this challenge,
  we’ve put together a Kubernetes Egress Security Checklist , based on best practices
  from real-world environments. Whether you’re just beginning to define your egress
  policies or looking to strengthen your existing posture, these 5 steps will help
  you reduce risk and improve visibility. [ ] Implement Global Default-Deny: Establish
  a global default-deny policy for all Ingress and egress traffic as a first-order
  security and compliance requirement. Ensure it explicitly excludes critical system
  pods and allows necessary DNS traffic.'
