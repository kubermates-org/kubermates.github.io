summary: 'Highlights at KubeCon + CloudNativeCon Europe 2026 include: AI Observability
  Platform Engineering Security Emerging + Advanced CNCF Hosted Co-Located Events
  KubeCon + CloudNativeCon Europe returns 23-26 March in Amsterdam, bringing the global
  community together to drive the future of cloud native computing SAN FRANCISCO,
  December 10, 2025 – The Cloud Native Computing Foundation ® (CNCF®), which builds
  sustainable ecosystems for cloud native software, today announced the schedule for
  KubeCon + CloudNativeCon Europe 2026 , taking place in Amsterdam from 23 to 26 March.
  The event will bring together adopters and technologists from leading open source
  and cloud native communities. CNCF’s recent State of Cloud Native Development report
  , in partnership with SlashData , found that cloud native adoption has reached 15.6
  million developers globally, with 77% of backend developers reportedly using at
  least one cloud native technology. The report further highlights that the cloud
  native ecosystem is entering a new maturity phase where automation, observability,
  and resilience drive competitive advantage. “We’re pleased to bring KubeCon + CloudNativeCon
  back to Amsterdam,” said Jonathan Bryce, executive director of CNCF. “This event
  continues to be a cornerstone for the industry to share ideas and tackle infrastructure
  challenges together. The 2026 schedule reflects the priorities we’re hearing from
  across the ecosystem and community—from building more secure, resilient systems
  to helping organizations deploy, secure, observe, and scale AI across use cases.
  ” The schedule highlights key cloud native trends and technologies. Attendees can
  choose from 224 keynotes, lightning talks, maintainer track sessions, and CFP breakout
  sessions. View the full schedule. According to the Q4 2025 CNCF Technology Landscape
  Radar report , 41% of AI developers are now cloud native, a figure projected to
  increase. This track highlights the growing convergence of AI and cloud native practices
  and is dedicated to exploring innovative applications, essential tools, and effective
  techniques for implementing AI and ML successfully within cloud-native ecosystems.'
