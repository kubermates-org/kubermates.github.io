  Latest capabilities and roadmap A perfect companion to KEDA Posted on December 9,
  2025 by Dotan Horovits CNCF projects highlighted in this post Ambassador post originally
  published on Medium by Dotan Horovits Microservices have been with us for nearly
  two decades, but it’s still far from easy to develop at scale, in a polyglot environment.
  The Dapr project, the Distributed Application Runtime, is an open source graduated
  project under the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) , which comes to address
  this pain. In my latest OpenObservability Talks episode I hosted Yaron Schneider
  , co-creator of Dapr (as well as of KEDA that will be covered in the next blog post
  ), and co-founder and CTO of Diagrid, a lead backer company to Dapr, to hear all
  about the project. Building microservices is hard. Anyone who has worked with distributed
  systems knows the challenges: connecting services, tracing asynchronous events,
  handling failures, scaling dynamically, accessing caching and messaging and more.
  Before Dapr, developers had to implement these patterns manually. Take the example
  of tracing, pulling SDKs for OpenTelemetry, wiring trace propagation through Kafka
  headers, and coordinating requests across multiple services. Even at Microsoft,
  where Yaron worked on Azure Container Apps, these issues were apparent at scale.
  Teams spent months and significant resources simply maintaining consistency across
  distributed workloads. Dapr was designed to address these inefficiencies — reducing
  what once took months to five minutes with a single developer. Dapr provides an
  application runtime for building microservices on Kubernetes. An intelligent sidecar
  alongside your application takes care of the messaging, pub-sub, service-to-service
  communications, storage, caching, secrets mgmt and more, so your application doesn’t
  need to be bothered with anything other than the local sidecar.'
