  Share At Red Hat, innovation begins with listening. In October 2025, the Red Hat
  Learning Think Tank forum brought together a group of passionate learners and leaders
  to listen, learn, and collaborate on Red Hat Learning Subscription and help shape
  its roadmap. The forum focused on what learners value most from Red Hat Learning
  Subscription , the challenges they face, and how Red Hat can better support technical
  skill development at scale. In this article, you’ll hear about the key takeaways
  from the meeting, next steps, and the importance of providing feedback to better
  empower current and future learners. “It’s a single pane of glass for all learning.
  ” – Martin Kaufmann Red Hat Learning Think Tank participants consistently highlighted
  how Red Hat Learning Subscription brings clarity and confidence to the certification
  journey. Red Hat Certification exams help teams focus on what matters most: building
  practical, job-ready skills. Participants particularly valued: Comprehensive content:
  Everything you need in one place. Early access and expert extras: Strategic advantages
  for staying ahead of emerging technologies. Guided learning paths: Confidence-building
  structure for certification preparation. Hands-on labs and live sessions: Real-world
  practice that brings concepts to life. Participants also provided feedback on how
  Red Hat Learning Subscription can improve.'
