  Applications Virtualization Share In this post: Learn about the importance of interoperability
  testing between the various 5G core network functions. Read about the challenges
  associated with 5G core lifecycle management, software versioning, and its impact
  on testing and verification. Find out how Red Hat and Rebaca’s autonomous continuous
  testing framework helps service providers with the consistent delivery of compliant
  and interoperable 5G core cloud-native network functions (CNFs). Deploying a 5G
  core network involves several key components, including the Access and Mobility
  Management Function (AMF) for connection and mobility management, the Session Management
  Function (SMF) for managing user data sessions, the User Plane Function (UPF) for
  service delivery, the Network Repository Function (NRF) for service discovery, and
  the Policy Control Function (PCF) for policy enforcement among others. A significant
  challenge for telecommunication (telco) service providers is the management of different
  software versions of these network functions, especially in a multivendor environment.
  A particular version may include new features, bug fixes, or require specific configurations.
  Consequently, testing of the network functions is complex, going beyond the verification
  of each component''s functionality to ensure that various versions of these network
  functions can interoperate. Dealing with this complexity necessitates extensive
  testing automation to guarantee streamlined operations across the service provider’s
  network. Adopting a cloud-native design for the 5G core gives service providers
  a competitive edge in building networks that easily scale and adapt. A distributed
  and disaggregated 5G core network introduces additional challenges, particularly
  around ensuring that all the different components can work together. As 5G core
  cloud-native network functions (CNFs) are made up of microservices that are constantly
  being updated and deployed in a dynamic environment, keeping tabs on security and
  adherence to standards becomes an overwhelming task. To ensure that all independently
  developed components of the 5G core operate effectively, the various network functions
  within the 5G core must interoperate efficiently, adhering to 3GPP standards.'
