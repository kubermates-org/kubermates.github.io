  Balaji Sivasubramanian CNCF projects highlighted in this post BackstageCon has been
  in existence since 2022, where it made its debut at KubeCon + CloudNativeCon North
  America in Detroit. We want attendees at BackstageCon to leave with a deeper understanding
  of the latest trends and use cases of Backstage. Last year, Backstage saw strong
  engagement from the end user community, with significant contributions driving its
  momentum. We aim to springboard from that success, by bringing together the Backstage
  community and sharing success stories, use cases, and the future of the Backstage
  project. The BackstageCon agenda is suitable for all skill levels, but we think
  that anyone involved in platform engineering, developer portals, or those interested
  in improving developer productivity will make the most out of this event. For early
  adopters of Backstage, this event is an excellent opportunity to learn from experienced
  users and contributors. Experienced Backstage users will find insights into the
  future of Backstage and can use this event as an excellent opportunity to network
  with other adopters. This year’s agenda introduces new topics, including how organizations
  of all sizes are scaling developer productivity using Backstage, the future of developer
  portals, and scaling AI development. This event will kick off in the main room with
  a welcome from the chairs. We have a single track agenda starting with an adopter
  session in scaling developer productivity. Keynote sessions from our sponsors will
  lead into several exciting sessions on topics from leveraging the new notification
  system, using scaffolder for workflows, and a panel discussion of the future of
  developer portals. Our afternoon will include sessions led by contributors and adopters
  covering topics like standardizing MCP deployment and governance, taming the post-startup
  stage with Backstage, and how one adopter is turning their insights into golden
  paths.
