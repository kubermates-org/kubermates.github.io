tldr: In Kubernetes v1.
summary: 'In Kubernetes v1. 33 support for user namespaces is enabled by default.
  This means that, when the stack requirements are met, pods can opt-in to use user
  namespaces. To use the feature there is no need to enable any Kubernetes feature
  flag anymore!  In this blog post we answer some common questions about user namespaces.
  But, before we dive into that, let''s recap what user namespaces are and why they
  are important. Note: Linux user namespaces are a different concept from Kubernetes
  namespaces.'
