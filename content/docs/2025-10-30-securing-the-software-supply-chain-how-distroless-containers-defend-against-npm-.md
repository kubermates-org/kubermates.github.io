summary: 'The wake-up call: npm ‘is’ package compromise Why traditional containers
  failed Distroless: Security through minimalism Taking distroless further: Secure,
  minimal containers for cloud native workloads Measurable impact Why it matters Bottom
  line Posted on October 30, 2025 by Dhanush VM, CleanStart In July 2025, the npm
  package “is” —downloaded millions of times each week—was quietly hijacked. A simple
  phishing email to its maintainer opened the door for attackers to inject malicious
  code into the software supply chain, embedding backdoors into thousands of downstream
  applications. This incident is more than a one-off breach; it’s a warning shot for
  the entire open source ecosystem. Even trusted dependencies can become vectors for
  sophisticated supply-chain attacks. As development pipelines grow increasingly automated,
  traditional defenses are no longer enough. To stay secure, organizations must rethink
  the foundation of their containers themselves. That’s where distroless containers
  come in—stripping away unnecessary components to eliminate entire classes of vulnerabilities
  before they can be exploited. Traditional containers are built like miniature operating
  systems. They include shells, package managers, network tools, and other system
  utilities — many of which are unnecessary for the application but are ideal targets
  for attackers. When the malicious ‘is’ package was executed in these environments,
  it had access to tools to download more payloads, connect to remote servers, and
  persist in the system. In essence, developers unintentionally shipped a hacker’s
  toolkit into production. Distroless containers flip this paradigm by including only
  the essentials required to run an application — nothing more.'
