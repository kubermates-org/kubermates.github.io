  Applications Virtualization Share The AI revolution has ignited a debate about what
  constitutes an " AI agent. " Using the term “AI agent” these days commonly implies
  autonomous, self-learning systems that pursue complex goals, adapting over time.
  A very impressive goal, but this purist vision can alienate traditional developers
  and slow innovation. It’s time to expand the definition, and embrace a broader perspective:
  AI agents don’t always need to self-learn or chase lofty goals. Functional agents
  —a new term—that connect large language models (LLMs) to APIs, physical devices,
  or event-driven systems can be just as impactful. By prioritizing function over
  form, we enable a broader pool of developers to engage in building AI agents, empower
  both AI and traditional developers to collaborate, and build practical solutions
  that drive real-world value. Let’s make progress without always demanding perfection.
  The traditional definition of an AI agent—rooted in significant AI research—demands
  autonomy, reasoning, learning, and goal-oriented behavior. These agents, like those
  powering autonomous vehicles or reinforcement learning models, are impressive but
  complex. They require deep expertise in machine learning (ML), which can feel like
  a barrier to traditional developers skilled in APIs, databases, or event-driven
  architectures. This purist stance risks gatekeeping, sidelining practical agents
  that don’t learn, but still solve critical problems. Why should an agent that wraps
  an API call or responds to a sensor be considered inferior? Not every challenge
  needs a self-evolving neural network—sometimes, a reliable, lightweight solution
  is enough.'
