tldr: Spotlight on SIG Release (Release Team Subproject) Final thoughts The Release
  Special Interest Group (SIG Release), where Kubernetes sharpens its blade with cutting-edge
  features and bug fixes every 4 months. Have you ever considered how such a big project
  like Kubernetes manages its timeline so efficiently to release its new version,
  or how the internal workings of the Release Team look like? If you’re curious about
  these questions or want to know more and get involved with the work SIG Release
  does, read on! SIG Release plays a crucial role in the development and evolution
  of Kubernetes.

  or how the internal workings of the Release Team look like? If you’re curious about
  these questions or want to know more and get involved with the work SIG Release
  does, read on! SIG Release plays a crucial role in the development and evolution
  of Kubernetes. Its primary responsibility is to manage the release process of new
  versions of Kubernetes. It operates on a regular release cycle, typically every
  three to four months. During this cycle, the Kubernetes Release Team works closely
  with other SIGs and contributors to ensure a smooth and well-coordinated release.
  This includes planning the release schedule, setting deadlines for code freeze and
  testing phases, as well as creating release artefacts like binaries, documentation,
  and release notes. Before you read further, it is important to note that there are
  two subprojects under SIG Release - Release Engineering and Release Team. In this
  blog post, Nitish Kumar interviews Verónica López (PlanetScale), Technical Lead
  of SIG Release, with the spotlight on the Release Team subproject, how the release
  process looks like, and ways to get involved. What is the typical release process
  for a new version of Kubernetes, from initial planning to the final release? Are
  there any specific methodologies and tools that you use to ensure a smooth release?
  The release process for a new Kubernetes version is a well-structured and community-driven
  effort. There are no specific methodologies or tools as such that we follow, except
  a calendar with a series of steps to keep things organised. The complete release
  process looks like this: What is the typical release process for a new version of
