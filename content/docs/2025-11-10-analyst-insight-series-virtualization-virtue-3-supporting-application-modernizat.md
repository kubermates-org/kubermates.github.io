  Global Market Intelligence 451 Research This blog is the third in our series on
  the benefits and trends of virtualization (read blog#1 and blog#2 here) and a companion
  to the 451 Research Business Impact Brief “ The virtues of virtualization. ” Application
  modernization means different things to different people, but its universal goal
  is to make information technology more responsive to business needs. Virtualization
  – the ability to run multiple operating systems on a single physical machine – planted
  the seed for the cloud computing paradigm that underlies most modern software development,
  and it also represents a critical bridge between legacy environments and the container-based
  and AI-driven deployments revolutionizing how we interact with IT. What does a modern
  workload look like? Microservices-based architectures, which put software functionality
  in small, flexible and portable application containers, are one hallmark of cloud-native
  deployments. 451 Research expects this market to grow at a 15% CAGR to reach $18
  billion by 2029. The boom in AI/ML-based workloads is a significant contributor
  to this forecast. One big challenge of deploying AI workloads is optimizing usage
  of the powerful graphics processing units (GPUs) needed to efficiently run them.
  The latest GPUs from NVIDIA, AMD and Intel have been hard to come by due to high
  demand, and they are expensive when they do become available, with prices reaching
  up to $40,000 each. The last thing a company wants after provisioning such pricey
  silicon is to have it sitting idle in a data center waiting to produce a return
  on the investment. The versatility of virtual machines (VMs) lets organizations
  “sweat the assets” of their IT environment no matter how heterogeneous the devices
  supporting it. Decoupling applications from the underlying hardware makes it possible
  to run software seamlessly across different machines and operating systems. With
  modern workloads and larger datasets, precious GPU capacity can be accessed and
  shared more effectively because GPU functionality can be sliced up and distributed
  at scale to support a variety of programs.'
