  Applications Virtualization Share Earlier this month at Red Hat OpenShift Commons,
  co-located with KubeCon + CloudNativeCon NA in Atlanta, we had the chance to recognize
  a few OpenShift Superheroes. While each member of the OpenShift community is a hero
  for helping contribute to a project’s success and growth, some members really stand
  out. They are the advocates and champions who make the community strong and successful.
  OpenShift Superheroes are made up of: Builders: Contributing to the evolution of
  OpenShift Advocates: Amplifying their OpenShift experience and learnings through
  events, blogs, meetups, and more Ambassadors: Shares knowledge across diverse teams,
  industries, organizations Here''s a look at who we recognized for helping to advance
  the community through their contributions, participation, and innovation. These
  nominations have been edited slightly for readability and context. The Ambassador
  “I’m nominating Larry Green from Neuberger Berman for the OpenShift Commons Super
  Hero Award. Larry has been instrumental in championing platform adoption across
  NB, implementing and managing a Kafka cluster on OpenShift that supports diverse
  enterprise workflows. His architectural leadership unified multiple vertical teams—spanning
  data, DevOps, and application domains—under a common OpenShift platform. Through
  collaboration, mentorship, and a strong technical vision, Larry has helped establish
  OpenShift as the standard across NB’s modernization efforts. ” The Advocate “Luis
  has been our OpenShift evangelist within ABB and in the process automation industry
  since the beginning of our partnership. We would like to thank him for his work
  and trust in Red Hat! Luis has been advocating Red Hat''s technology stack (in particular
  OpenShift) within ABB, allowing Red Hat to navigate the complexity of ABB and enabling
  cross collaboration among different teams in ABB and Red Hat. His business acumen
  and understanding of process automation has been a real asset for Red Hat to make
  important business cases to further develop the product.'
