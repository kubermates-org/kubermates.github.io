  Motivation and early milestones Overcoming challenges and addressing misconceptions
  Impact and the role of allies Expanding DEI efforts and future vision Call to action
  Wrapping up In recognition of Deaf Awareness Month and the importance of inclusivity
  in the tech community, we are spotlighting Catherine Paganini , facilitator and
  one of the founding members of CNCF Deaf and Hard-of-Hearing Working Group (DHHWG).
  In this interview, Sandeep Kanabar , a deaf member of the DHHWG and part of the
  Kubernetes SIG ContribEx Communications team , sits down with Catherine to explore
  the impact of the DHHWG on cloud native projects like Kubernetes. Sandeep’s journey
  is a testament to the power of inclusion. Through his involvement in the DHHWG,
  he connected with members of the Kubernetes community who encouraged him to join
  SIG ContribEx - the group responsible for sustaining the Kubernetes contributor
  experience. In an ecosystem where open-source projects are actively seeking contributors
  and maintainers, this story highlights how important it is to create pathways for
  underrepresented groups, including those with disabilities, to contribute their
  unique perspectives and skills. In this interview, we delve into Catherine’s journey,
  the challenges and triumphs of establishing the DHHWG, and the vision for a more
  inclusive future in cloud native. We invite Kubernetes contributors, maintainers,
  and community members to reflect on the significance of empathy, advocacy, and community
  in fostering a truly inclusive environment for all, and to think about how they
  can support efforts to increase diversity and accessibility within their own projects.
  Sandeep Kanabar (SK): Hello Catherine, could you please introduce yourself, share
  your professional background, and explain your connection to the Kubernetes ecosystem?
  Catherine Paganini (CP) : I’m the Head of Marketing at Buoyant , the creator of
  Linkerd , the CNCF-graduated service mesh, and 5th CNCF project. Four years ago,
  I started contributing to open source. The initial motivation was to make cloud
  native concepts more accessible to newbies and non-technical people. Without a technical
  background, it was hard for me to understand what Kubernetes, containers, service
  meshes, etc. mean.'
