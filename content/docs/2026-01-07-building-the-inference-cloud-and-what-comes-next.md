  for DigitalOcean, not only because we shipped more products and features than ever
  before, but because we solidified our vision about what the next era of cloud and
  AI will look like. We supported customers as they ran inference at scale, launched
  new products, engaged with our community in-person and online, and built out our

  for DigitalOcean, not only because we shipped more products and features than ever
  before, but because we solidified our vision about what the next era of cloud and

  inference cloud, which gives digital native enterprises and AI-native businesses
  the power to integrate AI and cloud workflows through one unified platform. At DigitalOcean,
  we know our customers are busy working on the same things we are—innovating with
  speed, integrating AI into their applications, and navigating rapid industry changes.
  Developers and digital native enterprises don’t want complexity, they want the ability
  to build quickly, scale with ease, and create with AI without requiring additional
  resources or time. Everything we built in 2025 was guided by those principles, and
  I can’t wait to share our 2026 plans with you soon. AI crossed an important threshold
  in 2025, becoming foundational to the work of not only large enterprises, but also
  digital native enterprises and startups. Our upcoming Currents research report confirms
  this, showing that 52% of organizations are actively implementing AI solutions,
  optimizing AI performance, or treating AI as a core component of their business
  strategy, compared to 35% who said the same in 2024. Our mission in 2025 was to
  make AI as simple and accessible as possible to cloud builders. To that end, in
  January we launched DigitalOcean Gradient AI Platform, and rapidly expanded its
  capabilities over the course of the year. The Gradient AI Platforms enables builders
  to: Build scalable AI agents: Deploy AI tools tailored to your specific needs using
  hosted third party LLMs, RAG workflows, and function calls. Build scalable AI agents:
  Deploy AI tools tailored to your specific needs using hosted third party LLMs, RAG
  workflows, and function calls. Seamlessly integrate with workflows: Embed agents
  into your applications through APIs or chatbot plugins.'
