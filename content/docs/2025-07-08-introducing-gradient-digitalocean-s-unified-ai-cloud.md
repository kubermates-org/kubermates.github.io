  \ July 30, 2025 3 min read At DigitalOcean, weâ\x80\x99ve always focused on delivering\
  \ simple, powerful infrastructure that helps digital native enterprises build and\
  \ scale their applications. Over the past year, weâ\x80\x99ve extended that commitment\
  \ into the AI space by investing in compute, tooling, and workflows that make it\
  \ easier to build with AI from the ground up. We believe that to truly unlock the\
  \ value of AI, developers need more than just infrastructure, they need an integrated\
  \ experience that spans the full development lifecycle. Thatâ\x80\x99s why weâ\x80\
  \x99re bringing together GPU infrastructure, intelligent agent development, and\
  \ pre-built AI applications into one cohesive platform. Today, weâ\x80\x99re taking\
  \ the next step in that journey with the introduction of DigitalOcean Gradient,\
  \ our unified AI cloud. It gives you everything you need to train, fine-tune, deploy,\
  \ and scale AI workloadsâ\x80\x94not just as isolated components, but as a seamless,\
  \ full-stack platform purpose-built for modern AI development. As our AI portfolio\
  \ has grown, weâ\x80\x99ve recognized the need for a dedicated identity that reflects\
  \ the scale and ambition of what weâ\x80\x99re building. The name DigitalOcean Gradient\
  \ captures both the technical roots of machine learning and the philosophy behind\
  \ our platform. In model training, gradients guide each step of learningâ\x80\x94\
  adjusting weights, reducing error, and moving toward better outcomes. In the same\
  \ way, DigitalOcean Gradient is designed to guide developers from idea to production,\
  \ with the right tools, abstractions, and infrastructure at every stage. Whether\
  \ youâ\x80\x99re experimenting with foundation models, building intelligent agents,\
  \ or deploying production workloads at scale, DigitalOcean Gradient is your end-to-end\
  \ AI cloud. With DigitalOcean Gradient, weâ\x80\x99re unifying our AI offerings\
  \ under one umbrella to make them easier to discover, adopt, and scale: DigitalOcean\
  \ Gradient Infrastructure: Building blocks like GPU Droplets, Bare Metal GPUs, vector\
  \ databases, and DO optimized software that helps improve model performance and\
  \ infrastructure scale out."
