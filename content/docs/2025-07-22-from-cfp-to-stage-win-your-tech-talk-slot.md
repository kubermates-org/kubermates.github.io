summary: 'You’ve devoted hours into a project, discovered something incredible, and
  decided you want to share it with the world. You find the perfect conference, open
  the Call for Proposals (CFP) form, and pour your heart into it. You hit "submit.
  " And then you wait… That rejection email always stings. We’ve all been there. But
  what if you could change the odds? What if you could move from hoping your talk
  gets chosen to expecting it? After speaking at numerous global conferences and analyzing
  hundreds of accepted and rejected talks, I’ve found that a winning proposal isn’t
  about luck. It’s about strategy. This guide will break down that strategy, making
  it applicable for any tech event, from a local Google Community Day to the global
  stages of KubeCon or a Linux Foundation Summit. Before you write a single word of
  your abstract, you need to pick the right topic. The best topics sit at the intersection
  of three things: Your title is the first - and sometimes only - thing a reviewer
  reads. It needs to be a powerful hook. This is where you sell the story you hinted
  at in your title.'
