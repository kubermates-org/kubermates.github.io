  After Learning DevOps? What Is Kubernetes? Finally, a Simple Explanation! You find
  the perfect conference, open the Call for Proposals (CFP) form, and pour your heart
  into it. You hit "submit. " And then you wait… That rejection email always stings.
  We’ve all been there. But what if you could change the odds? What if you could move
  from hoping your talk gets chosen to expecting it? After speaking at numerous global
  conferences and analyzing hundreds of accepted and rejected talks, I’ve found that
  a winning proposal isn’t about luck. It’s about strategy. This guide will break
  down that strategy, making it applicable for any tech event, from a local Google
  Community Day to the global stages of KubeCon or a Linux Foundation Summit. Before
  you write a single word of your abstract, you need to pick the right topic. The
  best topics sit at the intersection of three things: It Solves a Painful, Urgent
  Problem: Reviewers are looking for talks that solve a real-world problem their audience
  is facing right now. A talk on “migrating to Kubernetes” was a guaranteed hit in
  2019, but in 2025, the problem is no longer urgent. Conversely, a talk on “ securing
  a Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) system” is incredibly urgent today because
  it’s a new, complex technology with high stakes and few established best practices.
  Ask yourself: What are people complaining about on social media or in community
  Slacks? What new technology is causing both excitement and anxiety? That’s where
  you’ll find winning topics.'
