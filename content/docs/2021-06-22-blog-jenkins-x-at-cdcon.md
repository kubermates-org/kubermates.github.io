  - Kara de la Marck , CloudBees GitOps uses Git as the “single source of truth” for

  files version-controlled by Git has many advantages, but best practices for securely
  managing secrets with GitOps remain contested. Join us in this presentation about
  GitOps and Secret Management. Attendees will learn about different approaches to
  secret management with GitOps, the issues involved, and the secret management solutions
  offered by various tools and platforms. We will discuss the pros and cons of Vault,
  SOPS, offerings by public cloud providers, and more. GitOps uses Git as the “single
