  Automation Artificial intelligence Open hybrid cloud Security Edge computing Infrastructure
  Applications Virtualization Share When IT teams adopt automation, the benefits are
  often felt right away: Faster deployments, fewer manual errors, and more time to
  innovate. But when it comes time to visualizing and proving that value to business
  leaders and other stakeholders, the story often falls short. That changes with the
  new automation dashboard, available with Red Hat Ansible Automation Platform 2.6.
  Automation dashboard delivers real-time, actionable insights to help guide your
  day-to-day operations. You gain greater visibility across the entire automation
  footprint, both direct and indirect nodes, helping identify over-utilization and
  under-utilization of your Ansible Automation Platform subscriptions. That means
  you can better optimize and right-size your automation deployments, while executives
  can more readily see efficiency gains translated into business outcomes. The automation
  dashboard acts as a business case generator that runs 24/7. It continuously measures:
  Job success rates : A clear picture of what’s running smoothly. Time savings : Hours
  returned to teams across the business. Return on investment : Actual dollars saved
  by automation. With exportable PDF and CSV reports, IT leaders and automation teams
  can show exactly how much automation is saving, whether that’s proving ROI to a
  CFO, sharing successes with stakeholders, or identifying opportunities to optimize.
  Renewal cycles often trigger tough budget conversations.'
