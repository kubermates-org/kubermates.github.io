  Infrastructure Applications Virtualization Share Operationalizing AI models at scale
  is a critical challenge for IT leaders. While the initial cost of training a large
  language model (LLM) can be significant, the real and often underestimated expense
  is tied to inference. AI inference —the process of using a trained model to generate
  an output—is the most resource-intensive and costly part of an AI application, especially
  because it happens constantly during production. Inefficient inference can compromise
  an AI project's potential return on investment (ROI) and negatively impact customer
  experience due to high latency. Effectively serving LLMs at scale requires a strategic,
  full-stack approach that addresses both the model itself and the serving runtime.
  A single approach is not enough. Achieving high performance and cost efficiency
  requires a dual focus—managing resource consumption and maximizing throughput. A
  strategic part of this approach is model compression, which reduces a model's size
  and resource requirements without compromising accuracy. Quantization is a key technique
  for model optimization. It reduces the precision of a model's numerical values—like
  its weights and activations—from standard 16-bit to lower formats such as 8-bit
  or 4-bit. This significantly shrinks the model’s memory footprint, allowing it to
  run on less hardware. Sparsity is another effective method, which makes models more
  efficient by removing unnecessary connections (weights).
