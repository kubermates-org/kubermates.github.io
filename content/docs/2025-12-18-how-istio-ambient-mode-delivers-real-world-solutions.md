  See Istio Ambient Mode in Action For years, platform teams have known what a service
  mesh can provide: strong workload identity, authorization, mutual TLS authentication
  and encryption, fine-grained traffic control, and deep observability across distributed
  systems. In theory, Istio checked all the boxes. In practice though, many teams
  hit a wall. Across industries like financial services, media, retail, and SaaS,
  organizations told a similar story. They wanted mTLS between services to meet regulatory
  or security requirements. They needed safer deployment capabilities like canary
  rollouts and traffic splitting. They wanted visibility that went beyond IP addresses.
  However, traditional sidecar based meshes came with real costs: High operational
  complexity Thousands of sidecars to manage Fragile upgrade paths Hard to debug failure
  modes In several cases, teams started down the Istio service mesh path, only to
  pause or roll back entirely because the ongoing operational complexity was too high.
  The value of a service mesh was clear, but the service mesh architecture based on
  sidecars was not sustainable for many production environments. In many cases, organizations
  evaluated service meshes with clear goals in mind. They wanted mTLS between services,
  better control over traffic during deployments, and observability that could keep
  up. Some even deployed a service mesh briefly before stepping back.'
