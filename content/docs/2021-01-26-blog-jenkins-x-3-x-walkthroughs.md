  3. x is now looking ahead towards a GA release, with that we are producing walkthroughs
  for key areas to help users not only get started but get the most out of Jenkins
  X. To kick this off we are going to start with 9 videos that we’ll follow up with
  more dedicated blogs over the coming weeks. The complete playlist can be found here
  however the blog below gives a more context for each one. There are a few key areas
  we are focusing on here: Starting off with a very quick introduction including what
  to expect from the walkthrough series. Jenkins X 3. x has focussed on clearer lines
  of separation, making the architecture significantly more pluggable, extensible
  and maintainable. With better tooling including UIs and more reliable guard rails
  for installations and upgrades. Jenkins X 3 also minimises abstractions and wrapping;
  so it promotes the direct use of open source projects like Helm, Helmfile and Tekton.
  Decoupling the management of Cloud infrastructure away from Jenkins X to tools that
  are better suited for the job. Jenkins X has started with Terraform and this manages
  all the cloud resources needed by Jenkins X Kubernetes cluster Cloud Service Accounts
  IAM bindings Storage buckets Over time Jenkins X plans to support other tools (aided
  by the Kubernetes Cluster API ) users in the Kubernetes ecosystem leverage such
  as crossplane.'
