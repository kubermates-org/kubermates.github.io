  Kubernetes has become the go-to platform for running large-scale Apache Spark workloads.
  But as workloads scale, how do you ensure your Spark jobs run efficiently without
  hitting bottlenecks? Managing thousands of concurrent Spark jobs can introduce severe
  performance challenges —from CPU saturation in the Spark Operator to Kubernetes
  API slowdowns and job scheduling inefficiencies. To address these challenges, we
  are excited to introduce the Kubeflow Spark Operator Benchmarking Results and Toolkit
  —a comprehensive framework to analyze performance, pinpoint bottlenecks, and optimize
  your Spark on Kubernetes deployments. This benchmarking effort provides three key
  outcomes to help you take full control of your Spark on Kubernetes deployment: ✅
  Benchmarking Results – A detailed evaluation of performance insights and tuning
  recommendations for large-scale Spark workloads. 🛠 Benchmarking Test Toolkit – A
  fully reproducible test suite to help users evaluate their own Spark Operator performance
  and validate improvements. 📊 Open-Sourced Grafana Dashboard – A battle-tested visualization
  tool designed specifically to track large-scale Spark Operator deployments, providing
  real-time monitoring of job processing efficiency, API latencies, and system health.
  Running thousands of Spark jobs on Kubernetes at scale uncovers several performance
  roadblocks that can cripple efficiency if left unresolved: 🚦 Spark Operator Becomes
  CPU-Bound : When handling thousands of Spark jobs, the controller pod maxes out
  CPU resources, limiting job submission rates. 🐢 High API Server Latency : As workloads
  scale, Kubernetes API responsiveness degrades—job status updates slow down, affecting
  observability and scheduling efficiency. 🕒 Webhook Overhead Slows Job Starts : Using
  webhooks adds ~60 seconds of extra latency per job, reducing throughput in high-concurrency
  environments. 💥 Namespace Overload Causes Failures : Running 6,000+ SparkApplications
  in a single namespace resulted in pod failures due to excessive environment variables
  and service object overload. 💡 So, how do you fix these issues and optimize your
  Spark Operator deployment? That’s where our benchmarking results and toolkit come
  in. Based on our benchmarking findings, we provide clear, actionable recommendations
  for improving Spark Operator performance at scale.'
