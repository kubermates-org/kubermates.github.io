  Share Managing a hybrid environment can feel like a balancing act between disparate
  sets of fragmented tools used for all the different platforms you interact with.
  If that sounds familiar, then your team needs integrated management across your
  diverse hybrid infrastructure. With Red Hat Hybrid Cloud Console, you can manage
  your public cloud instances, on-premise virtualization, and security compliance
  all in one dashboard. The Red Hat Hybrid Cloud Console was built to solve fragmentation
  by unifying the management of Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL), Red Hat OpenShift,
  and Red Hat Ansible Automation Platform into a single interface. In this guide,
  we''re answering your top questions about the console''s evolution to help you understand
  how it fits into your modern operational workflow. A: Hybrid Cloud Console serves
  as a unified control plane for connecting to and centrally managing your diverse
  Red Hat platforms and infrastructure across your entire hybrid cloud environment.
  By providing a single point of visibility and operation, Hybrid Cloud Console simplifies
  the management of geographically distributed, diverse deployments. This powerful
  console enables you to effectively manage and automate a broad spectrum of Red Hat
  offerings, including: RHEL infrastructure: Gain centralized management for your
  RHEL server fleet, enabling simplified patching, lifecycle management, and security
  compliance across your enterprise operating system deployments. OpenShift clusters:
  Administer and monitor your containerized applications and infrastructure running
  on OpenShift, streamlining cluster operations, resource management, and application
  deployment pipelines. Ansible Automation Platform infrastructure: Leverage the console
  to integrate with and manage your Ansible Automation Platform infrastructure, enabling
  the consistent execution and scaling of automation across your IT estate, from infrastructure
  provisioning to application configuration. Application services: Beyond core infrastructure,
  Hybrid Cloud Console also supports the management of various application services,
  offering a consolidated view and control point for the software components and services
  running on your Red Hat platforms. Ultimately, the Hybrid Cloud Console enhances
  operational efficiency, enables consistency, and provides the tools to automate
  the management of your hybrid cloud and the critical deployments within it, regardless
  of where they reside—on-premises, in public clouds, or at the edge.'
