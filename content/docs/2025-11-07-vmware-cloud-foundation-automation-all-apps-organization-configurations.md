  Part 1: Pre-requisites and Hardware Compatibility In today’s private cloud world,
  enterprise IT is evolving from “build and manually manage everything” to “provide
  agile, self-service infrastructure to application teams,” while still maintaining
  governance, security, and cost control. With VMware Cloud Foundation Automation
  , you have a platform delivered by the provider team (or the internal cloud platform
  team) that hands off a polished, governed, ready-to-use environment to your organization’s
  administrators, who then enable application teams. In VCF Automation, an organization
  is a top-level construct created by the provider administrator to represent a tenant
  or line of business. Each organization operates within its own secure, isolated
  boundary, ensuring that users can access only the services and resources assigned
  to them. Organizations consume capacity and cloud services from a shared resource
  pool, and then subdivide those resources for their application teams — modeled in
  VCF Automation as Projects and Namespaces. Within each organization, users are assigned
  roles that define their access and responsibilities, enabling controlled, governed
  self-service. Think of it like a modern enterprise campus: the provider team has
  constructed the building — the power, cooling, network backbone, and secure access
  points. Now the keys are handed over to the organization administrator to define
  how the space is used — allocating areas for teams, setting access controls, defining
  shared services, and ensuring everyone can work efficiently within the infrastructure’s
  boundaries. The foundation is ready — now it’s time to prepare the workspace where
  applications and teams will thrive. In this blog, we’re focusing on the moment right
  after the hand-off: you’re the org admin, the region quota has been allocated, the
  networking plumbing is in place, and your “All Apps” organization is ready for configuration.
  Why “All Apps Organization”? Because this organization type is designed to support
  the broadest range of workloads — from traditional VM-based application stacks to
  containerized microservices platforms— both of which your application teams expect
  to consume at speed and with consistency. Your role as the organization admin is
  to set that up once — defining Projects/Namespaces, configuring networking and consumption
  boundaries, setting identity providers up and user access, and making sure app teams
  can hit the ground running — all while protecting the underlying infrastructure.'
