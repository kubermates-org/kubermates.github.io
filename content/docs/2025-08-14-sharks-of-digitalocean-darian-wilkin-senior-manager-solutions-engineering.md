summary: "By Sujatha R Technical Writer Darian Wilkin has been part of DigitalOceanâ\x80\
  \x99s story for over eight years, witnessing firsthand the companyâ\x80\x99s transformation\
  \ from scaling startup to public company. As a Senior Manager of Solutions Architecture,\
  \ he helps customers build smarter, more scalable cloud solutions. Darian has seen\
  \ how DigitalOcean has grown to serve more complex workloads for digital native\
  \ enterprises, while staying true to its roots as a developer-friendly cloud. For\
  \ Darian, the answer is simple: the people and the culture that bring them together.\
  \ â\x80\x9CI think youâ\x80\x99ll hear this from just about anyone at DigitalOcean,\
  \ the people are what make this place special. Not only do I get to work with extremely\
  \ talented folks, but everyone genuinely enjoys being here. That creates an environment\
  \ and culture thatâ\x80\x99s really pleasant to be a part of. â\x80\x9D Itâ\x80\x99\
  s this mix of collaboration, shared passion, and a love for the work that keeps\
  \ Darian energized after nearly a decade at DO. ð\x9F\x8E¥ Have a look at Darian\
  \ Wilkinâ\x80\x99s full conversation â¬\x87ï¸\x8F â\x80\x9CI like to think of our\
  \ team as the lubricant in the gears that keep things moving when businesses are\
  \ adopting cloud technologies. We meet with customers one-on-one to help them design\
  \ robust, fault-tolerant, and performant architectures, while keeping costs in check.\
  \ If our customers canâ\x80\x99t expand their cloud presence in a reliable and cost-effective\
  \ way, their business is going to struggle. So they rely on us for best practices\
  \ and forward-looking advice on how to get better in the cloud."
