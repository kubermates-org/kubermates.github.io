summary: 'Authors: Dewan Ahmed (Aiven) and Chris Short (AWS) SIG Multicluster is the
  Special Interest Group (SIG) focused on how Kubernetes concepts are expanded and
  used beyond the cluster boundary. Historically, Kubernetes resources only interacted
  within that boundary - KRU or Kubernetes Resource Universe (not an actual Kubernetes
  concept). Kubernetes clusters, even now, don’t really know anything about themselves
  or, about other clusters. Absence of cluster identifiers is a case in point. With
  the growing adoption of multicloud and multicluster deployments, the work SIG Multicluster
  doing is gaining a lot of attention. In this article, Jeremy Olmsted-Thompson, Google
  and Chris Short, AWS discuss the interesting problems SIG Multicluster is solving
  and how you can get involved. Their initials JOT and CS will be used for brevity.
  CS : How long has the SIG Multicluster existed and how was the SIG in its infancy?
  How long have you been with this SIG? JOT : I’ve been around for almost two years
  in the SIG Multicluster. All I know about the infancy years is from the lore but
  even in the early days, it was always about solving this same problem. Early efforts
  have been things like KubeFed. I think there are still folks using KubeFed but it’s
  a smaller slice. Back then, I think people out there deploying large numbers of
  Kubernetes clusters were really not at a point where we had a ton of real concrete
  use cases.'
