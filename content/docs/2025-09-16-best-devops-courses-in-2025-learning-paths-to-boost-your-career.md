summary: '2025-ready skills - IT Foundations --> Linux & Networking --> Git --> Containers
  --> Kubernetes --> CI/CD --> IaC --> GitOps --> Observability --> Security --> Platform
  Engineering --> Cloud --> AI. AI everywhere - LLMs, MCPs, RAG, anomaly detection,
  and copilots are now part of daily DevOps workflows. Hands-on learning - every step
  mapped to KodeKloud’s lab-first courses, and real projects. Clear role tracks -
  follow one of four paths: DevOps Engineer, Site Reliability Engineer, Platform Engineer,
  or Cloud-Dev. Milestone projects - practical, production-like capstones to showcase
  on GitHub and in interviews. Free AI Week - start with the exclusive 5-Day AI Learning
  Path to build confidence with modern AI skills. DevOps in 2025 is no longer about
  “tools-first. ” Teams are building reliable platforms that support fast delivery
  and strong governance. At the same time, AI is becoming a core part of the workflow
  -from writing Kubernetes manifests to detecting anomalies in observability dashboards.
  The expectations are broader: Production fundamentals (Linux, networking, shell,
  Git) are non‑negotiable. Cloud-native skills (containers, Kubernetes, service meshes,
  Gateway API) are baseline. IaC + GitOps is how infra/app changes land in prod-repeatably,
  auditor‑friendly.'
