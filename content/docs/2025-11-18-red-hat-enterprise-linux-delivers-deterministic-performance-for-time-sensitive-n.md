  Infrastructure Applications Virtualization Share The industrial world runs on timing
  and consistency. In manufacturing and operations, a predictable outcome isn''t a
  nice-to-have; it''s the core promise of the industrial system itself. Whether you''re
  managing complex motion control or critical process loops, network communication
  must be reliable and predictable. Time-sensitive networking (TSN) is the essential
  evolution of Ethernet that brings determinism and a guaranteed delivery schedule
  to a standard open industrial network. But here''s the reality check for information
  technology (IT) and operations technology (OT) leaders: TSN is great for the wire
  and hardware, but it''s only as good as the software stack running on the devices
  at the edge. A jittery operating system can ruin a perfect TSN network before a
  packet ever leaves the device. Things like hardware interrupts, cache swapping,
  or even heavy application use (like AI or video management) can significantly impact
  the OS''s ability to build and deliver packets in that crucial, repeatable fashion.
  At Red Hat, we understand the needs of Industrial and we know how important it is
  to be at peak performance. So we set up tests to prove it. We recently completed
  a hands-on technical validation, in collaboration with Intel, to demonstrate how
  Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) and Red Hat Device Edge deliver the precise, deterministic
  performance required for industrial TSN. A real-time kernel: A tuned operating system
  designed to use a deterministic scheduler to ensure critical tasks execute in fixed
  time bounds. Guaranteed predictable execution of high-priority workloads by controlling
  interrupt handling, resource locking, and context switching.'
