  in this post If you’ve ever debugged a production incident, you know that the hardest
  part often isn’t the fix, it’s finding where to begin. Most on-call engineers end
  up spending hours piecing together clues, fighting time pressure, and trying to
  make sense of scattered data. You’ve probably run into one or more of these challenges:
  Unwritten knowledge and missing context: You’re pulled into an outage for a service
  you barely know. The original owners have changed teams, the documentation is half-written,
  and the “runbook” is either stale or missing altogether. You spend the first 30
  minutes trying to find someone who’s seen this issue before — and if you’re unlucky,
  this incident is a new one. Tool overload and context switching: Your screen looks
  like an air traffic control dashboard. You’re running monitoring queries, flipping
  between Grafana and Application Insights, checking container logs, and scrolling
  through traces — all while someone’s asking for an ETA in the incident channel.
  Correlating data across tools is manual, slow, and mentally exhausting. Overwhelming
  complexity and knowledge gaps: Modern cloud-native systems like Kubernetes are powerful,
  but they’ve made troubleshooting far more complex. Every layer — nodes, pods, controllers,
  APIs, networking, autoscalers – introduces its own failure modes. To diagnose effectively,
  you need deep expertise across multiple domains, something even seasoned engineers
  can’t always keep up with.'
