summary: 'Posted on December 18, 2025 by epower CNCF projects highlighted in this
  post A decade on from its first commit in 2015, 2025 marks a significant milestone
  for the Cilium project. The community has published the 2025 Cilium Annual Report:
  A Decade of Cloud Native Networking , which reflects on the project’s evolution,
  key milestones, and notable developments over the past year. What began as an experimental
  container networking effort has grown into a mature, widely adopted platform, bringing
  together cloud native networking, observability, and security through an eBPF-based
  architecture. As Cilium enters its second decade, the community continues to grow
  in both size and momentum, with sustained high-volume development, widespread production
  adoption, and expanding use cases including virtual machines and large-scale AI
  infrastructure. We invite you to explore the 2025 Annual Report and celebrate a
  decade of cloud native networking with the community. For any questions or feedback,
  please reach out to contribute@cilium. io. Share.'
