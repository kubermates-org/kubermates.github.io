summary: 'There will be six Jenkins X talks given by various speakers at the first-ever
  CDCon on October 7-8. The two-day virtual event, hosted by the Continuous Delivery
  Foundation, will focus on improving the world’s capacity to deliver software with
  security and speed. Register to attend the virtual event for only 25 USD and get
  access to all of the following Jenkins X talks and more. A CI/CD Framework for Production
  Machine Learning at Massive Scale (using Jenkins X and Seldon Core) Speaker: Alejandro
  Saucedo, Seldon Time: 1:15 PM PDT Managing production machine learning systems as
  internal data science infrastructure requirements grow, has uncovered new challenges
  which have required fundamentally different approaches to that of traditional CI/CD
  in software engineering. In this talk we will dive into the work we are doing at
  the SIG-MLOps and the CD Foundation towards developing the methodologies that encompass
  best practices to continuously integrate and deploy machine learning in production
  at massive scale. In this talk, we’ll provide key insights on the core MLOps concepts,
  as well as a hands-on coding example where we take a text classification model through
  its training, deployment and promotion as canary and shadow deployments, which will
  also allow us to get deeper and more specific insight on our production environment.
  Dailymotion’s Continuous Delivery Story Speaker: Vincent Behar, Dailymotion Time:
  3:30 PM PDT In this session, Vincent will share Dailymotion’s Continuous Delivery
  story with Jenkins, Jenkins X and Tekton. He will come back on the initial state
  and issues faced on the CI/CD topic, and how it was solved. He will insist on the
  practices that were put in place and the benefits that resulted from switching to
  Jenkins X. He will conclude with the new challenges brought by improving Dailymotion’s
  Continuous Delivery platform. If you are wondering if Jenkins X is the right tool
  for you, and the impact it can have on your team(s), then this is the right session
  for you! Moving from Jenkins to Jenkins X: Scaling and Accelerating CI/CD Speaker:
  Dr Michael Garbade, Education Ecosystem Time: 12:00 PM PDT Jenkins has served as
  a continuous integration (CI) tool long before the emergence of Kubernetes and distributed
  systems running on cloud-native platforms. Working with Jenkins as a stand-alone
  open-source tool has proved to be extremely difficult for distributed systems engineers,
  as it is designed for small projects and not scalable to bigger projects.'
