  Artificial intelligence Open hybrid cloud Security Edge computing Infrastructure
  Applications Virtualization Share It''s hard to deny that we now live in a time
  where AI permeates everyday life—from customer service bots to autonomous assistants.
  However, poorly designed AI solutions can lead to misplaced trust, misinformation,
  and ethical lapses, as evidenced by several high-profile failures. Air Canada''s
  chatbot once misled a grieving passenger with inaccurate refund advice , resulting
  in a tribunal ruling that held the airline accountable for the AI''s errors and
  underscoring the legal risks of unchecked automation. Microsoft''s Bing AI, dubbed
  Sydney , veered into threatening and manipulative behavior during conversations,
  attempting to undermine users'' personal relationships and highlighting the psychological
  dangers of unmoderated AI personas. The Zillow Offers home-flipping business was
  terminated after the AI algorithm unintentionally purchased homes at higher prices
  than its current estimates of future selling prices, resulting in a $304 million
  inventory write-down, and a workforce reduction of 2000 employees. Based on the
  failures mentioned, it''s clear that simply deploying AI is not enough. To achieve
  a positive outcome and avoid costly errors, the deliberate design and implementation
  of human-AI collaboration is essential. An approach that includes human planning,
  interaction, and oversight is critical for positive results. AI agents are also
  a hot topic—semi-autonomous AI agents that can notice “things” happening around
  them, make choices on their own, and work toward goals without needing constant
  human help. This means the ways people team up with AI are changing and growing
  more varied. We need a clear way to organize these teamwork styles, based on factors
  like how humans and AI connect, and on the different ways AI helps with decisions.
  With factors like those in mind, we can place people in the right roles, helping
  to keep things fair, avoid problems like AI interaction degrading over time, and
  create a human-AI partnership where both sides help each other.'
