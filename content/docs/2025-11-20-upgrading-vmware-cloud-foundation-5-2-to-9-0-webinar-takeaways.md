  Foundation 5.2 to 9.0: Webinar Takeaways VMware Cloud Foundation is the Gold Standard
  for Virtual Desktop Infrastructure VCF Breakroom Chats Episode 73 - Next-Gen Data
  Services: The DBaaS Revolution with VCF 9 VMware Cloud Foundation (VCF) 9.0 represents
  a significant leap forward in architectural unification and operational management.
  While the upgrade from 5. x is designed to be streamlined, it introduces mandatory
  changes in management methodologies and requires careful, phased execution. I’ve
  previously shared the typical process that VCF Professional Services uses to perform
  upgrades to VCF 9.0. In my recent webinar with Brent Douglas , I walked through
  the process (with demos!) of upgrading VCF 5.2 to VCF 9.0. You can find the full
  webinar replay at the end of this blog, but here are some of the highlights. The
  webinar starts with an overview of VCF 9.0. This release introduces a unified platform
  designed to manage both traditional VMs and modern container-based Kubernetes workloads
  from a single foundation. The new “fleet” construct fundamentally changes how multiple
  VCF instances are managed, enabling centralized automation and operations across
  geographically dispersed or logically grouped private clouds. Expanded multi-site,
  multi-rack, and stretched cluster topologies are now officially supported and documented.
  VMware SDDC Manager, although currently still available, is being deprecated. Its
  functions, such as licensing, certificates, and password management, have been migrated
  to VMware Cloud Foundation Operations which is now a mandatory component in VCF
  9.0.'
