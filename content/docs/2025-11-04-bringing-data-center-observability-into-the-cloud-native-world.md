summary: 'The legacy divide An open approach Why this matters now CLDF: From theory

  2025! Posted on November 4, 2025 by Julia Furst Morgado, Dash0 CNCF projects highlighted
  in this post When people talk about cloud-native observability, the conversation
  usually revolves around applications, containers, and microservices. However, under
  those layers lies an equally critical foundation: The physical data center. Servers,
  storage systems, and networks ultimately host every workload, yet the telemetry
  these systems produce is often trapped in silos, separated from the cloud-native
  tools teams rely on daily. This separation creates blind spots. It means operators
  can gain detailed insights into application behavior while knowing far less about
  the hardware underneath. When issues arise, that gap slows down troubleshooting
  and makes it harder to connect cause and effect across the stack. In short, the
  story of observability remains incomplete. At KubeCon + CloudNativeCon North America
  2025, Julia Furst Morgado, Principal Developer Relations Engineer at Dash0, and
  Pedro Célestin, Principal SRE at CLDF, will explore how to close this gap. Our session
  will show how open-source tools and standards can bring datacenter telemetry into
  the same pipelines that are already used for cloud-native systems, creating a unified
  view from hardware to applications. Most data centers today are still monitored
  through proprietary vendor platforms. These tools work well within their own ecosystems
  but rarely integrate cleanly with cloud-native observability stacks. The result
  is a patchwork of data silos that limit flexibility and obscure the relationships
  between infrastructure and workloads.'
