  Getting started: AI inside Lima Posted on December 11, 2025 by Akihiro Suda, Lima
  Project Maintainer CNCF projects highlighted in this post On November 6th, the Lima
  project team shipped the second major release of Lima. In this release, the team
  are expanding the project focus to cover AI as well as containers. Lima (Linux Machines)
  is a command line tool to launch a local Linux virtual machine, with the primary
  focus on running containers on a laptop. The project began in May 2021, with the
  aim of promoting containerd including nerdctl (contaiNERD CTL) to Mac users. The
  project joined the CNCF in September 2022 as a Sandbox project, and was promoted
  to the Incubating level in October 2025. Through the growth of the project, the
  scope has expanded to support non-container workloads and non-macOS hosts too. See
  also: “ Lima becomes a CNCF incubating project ”. Lima now provides the plugin infrastructure
  that allows third-parties to implement new features without modifying Lima itself:
  VM driver plugins : for additional hypervisors. CLI plugins : for additional subcommands
  of the `limactl` command. URL scheme plugins : for additional URL schemes to be
  passed as `limactl create SCHEME:SPEC`. The plugin interfaces are still experimental
  and subject to change. The interfaces will be stabilized in future releases.'
