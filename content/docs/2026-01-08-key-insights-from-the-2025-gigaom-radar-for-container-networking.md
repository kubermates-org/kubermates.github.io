  the Report In 2025, as modern applications became ever more distributed and the
  use of Kubernetes continued to proliferate, the role of container networking was
  critical. Today’s enterprises demand networking solutions that can scale, secure,
  and connect services reliably, whether those services run across multiple clouds,
  hybrid environments, or on-premises clusters. We’re proud to share insights from
  the recently released 2025 GigaOm Radar Report for Container Networking , a comprehensive
  evaluation of vendor solutions across innovation, platform maturity, and real-world
  operational capabilities, and to highlight the unique strengths of Calico Cloud
  and Calico Enterprise as recognized in the report. GigaOm’s Radar Report evaluates
  container networking solutions across a spectrum of criteria that matter most to
  IT infrastructure teams and cloud architects. These include: Network Policy Definition:
  Declarative, granular network policies consistently enforced across clusters Routing
  (Layer 3/Layer 4): Scalable routing between pods, services, and non-container workloads
  using Layer 3 (IP) and Layer 4 (TCP) protocols Layer 7 Networking: Application-aware
  traffic handling with visibility using Layer 7 protocols Load Balancing: Controls
  how traffic is distributed across instances, using latency history to select optimal
  paths and adjust traffic flows in real time Container Network Security: Comprehensive
  security including segmentation, traffic observability, and dynamic threat response
  DevOps Suitability: Automated networking that enables development teams to evolve
  without creating infrastructure bottlenecks eBPF Implementation: High-performance
  data plane that delivers deep visibility and efficient traffic handling Observability
  and Diagnostics: End-to-end flow visibility with accelerated root-cause analysis
  We’re honored that GigaOm recognizes Tigera, the creator of Project Calico, as a
  leading platform for container networking. GigaOm highlights Calico in the Platform
  Play/Innovation quadrant, underscoring its strong balance of innovation and deep
  unified platform capabilities across container networking. Customers and evaluators
  alike recognize that effective container networking is more than just connectivity;
  it must also deliver network security and observability without imposing complexity
  or unnecessary operational overhead. Here’s where Calico stands out according to
  GigaOm’s evaluation: Calico’s networking and security capabilities extend far beyond
  basic connectivity: Network segmentation and microsegmentation Fine-grained traffic
  filtering and access controls Integrated IDS/IPS and deep packet inspection Control
  and secure egress traffic with fixed IPs, policy routing, and auditing.'
