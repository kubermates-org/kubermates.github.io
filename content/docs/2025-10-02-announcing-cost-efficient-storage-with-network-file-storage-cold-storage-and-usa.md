  \ AI workloads. You can preview it in the DigitalOcean console after the release.\
  \ Spaces cold storage for infrequently accessed data is available for public preview.\
  \ Visit our documentation to learn more and create a support ticket to request access\
  \ to preview Spaces cold storage. Usage-based backups is available for public preview\
  \ to meet aggressive rpos. Check out our documentation to learn more. Request access\
  \ to preview usage-based backups by submitting this form. Data-intensive applications,\
  \ particularly in AI and machine learning, require shared, high-performance file\
  \ storage that is easy to provision and manage. Introducing our new Network File\
  \ System (NFS) service, generally available in our ATL1 and NYC data centers starting\
  \ October 20, 2025. This fully managed, high-performance solution is specifically\
  \ designed to meet the demands of AI/ML startups and data-centric businesses by\
  \ enabling concurrent shared dataset access for multi-node workloads."
