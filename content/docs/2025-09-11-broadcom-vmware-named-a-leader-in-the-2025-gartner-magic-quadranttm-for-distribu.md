  8, 2025, by Julia Palmer, Jefferey Hewitt, Elaine Zhang, Tony Harvey, Dennis Smith.
  The submission is based on VMware Cloud Foundation (VCF), a DHI platform that delivers
  public cloud scale and agility with private cloud security, resilience and performance,
  that lowers total cost of ownership. On the heels of a very successful VMware Explore
  2025, Broadcom continues to invest in VCF to help customers on their modern private
  cloud journey. Here are some of the most recent updates: VCF 9.0 General Availability
  Broadcom announced general availability of VCF 9.0 on June 17, 2025. VCF 9.0 is
  a unified private cloud platform designed for running traditional, modern, and AI
  workloads with a consistent cloud operational model, comprehensive automation, and
  enhanced security across private data centers, edge, CSP and hyperscale cloud environments.
  VCF 9.0 delivers a streamlined, self-service experience for developers, robust compliance
  tools, advanced networking capabilities with multi-tenant VPC services, and integrated
  security and resilience features through fleet-level management and automated identity,
  access and certificate rotation. VCF 9.0 focuses on accelerating application modernization
  and innovation by providing agility and scalability comparable to public clouds
  while maintaining control, security, and better cost predictability. VMware Explore
  Updates VMware Explore 2025, held August 25-28, 2025 in Las Vegas, focused on delivering
  a unified AI native private cloud platform that simplifies operations, empowers
  developers, and addresses the security and compliance demands of modern enterprises.
  VCF as an AI-ready platform: Previously sold separately, VCF Private AI services
  will now be included as a standard capability of VCF 9.0 in the first quarter of
  Broadcom’s FY2026. Private AI services enable privacy and security, simplify infrastructure
  management and streamline model deployment.'
