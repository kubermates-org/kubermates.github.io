summary: 'Spotlight on SIG Architecture: Conformance About SIG Architecture and the
  Conformance subproject More on the Conformance Test Suite This is the first interview
  of a SIG Architecture Spotlight series that will cover the different subprojects.
  We start with the SIG Architecture: Conformance subproject In this SIG Architecture
  spotlight, we talked with Riaan Kleinhans (ii-Team), Lead for the Conformance sub-project.
  Frederico (FSM) : Hello Riaan, and welcome! For starters, tell us a bit about yourself,
  your role and how you got involved in Kubernetes. Riaan Kleinhans (RK) : Hi! My
  name is Riaan Kleinhans and I live in South Africa. I am the Project manager for
  the ii-Team in New Zealand. When I joined ii the plan was to move to New Zealand
  in April 2020 and then Covid happened. Fortunately, being a flexible and dynamic
  team we were able to make it work remotely and in very different time zones. The
  ii. nz team have been tasked with managing the Kubernetes Conformance testing technical
  debt and writing tests to clear the technical debt. I stepped into the role of project
  manager to be the link between monitoring, test writing and the community. Through
  that work I had the privilege of meeting the late Dan Kohn in those first months,
  his enthusiasm about the work we were doing was a great inspiration. FSM : Thank
  you - so, your involvement in SIG Architecture started because of the conformance
  work? RK : SIG Architecture is the home for the Kubernetes Conformance subproject.'
