  technological advances create a constant challenge for IT leaders. You simply cannot
  afford to wait and see which advances fall by the wayside or end up worthy of adoption.
  The pressure to invest in technologies like AI is immense, but chasing the latest
  breakthroughs without first defining a clear strategy is a risk that can delay long-term
  innovation. The key question you must address isn''t what your specific AI plan
  should be, it''s how you can build an enterprise capable of adapting to any disruption.
  This means moving beyond merely reacting to and recovering from change to being
  able to continuously deliver value while the world is changing around you. You need
  to achieve enterprise durability and adaptability. Building an adaptable, AI-ready
  foundation begins with a clear-eyed view of your business goals. You must define
  the problem or challenge first, and only then determine if AI can provide a solution.'
