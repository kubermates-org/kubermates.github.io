summary: "By Martin Nguyen Hatch is DigitalOceanâ\x80\x99s global program for startups\
  \ that provides select technology companies with cloud infrastructure credits and\
  \ discounts, direct access to DigitalOceanâ\x80\x99s product experts for personalized\
  \ guidance, priority technical support, and access to a thriving community of like-minded\
  \ founders. By keeping infrastructure and cost management simple, the Hatch program\
  \ enables startups to build tech solutions that make an impact. For Georgi Petrov\
  \ and Mihail Stoychev, the co-founders and serial entrepreneurs behind Uxify , choosing\
  \ DigitalOcean to host their startupâ\x80\x99s infrastructure was a no-brainer.\
  \ They built their previous ventures NitroPack, SMSBump, and iSenseLabs on DigitalOcean\
  \ and could trust the platformâ\x80\x99s simplicity, reliability, and user experience.\
  \ When it came time to power Uxifyâ\x80\x99s AI-enabled website performance solution\
  \ and AI agent Uxi, they opted for DigitalOcean again With Hatch program benefits\
  \ like cloud credits and GPU Droplet discounts, Uxify could focus on building and\
  \ scaling their underlying AI infrastructure. Uxifyâ\x80\x99s story begins over\
  \ a decade ago with iSenseLabs, an agency that provided services but also built\
  \ and sold its own products. One of those products was NitroPack, a performance\
  \ optimization tool designed to help websites load faster. As NitroPack gained traction,\
  \ the team began seeing possibilities beyond their current solution. Fast forward\
  \ to 2024, the team behind NitroPack reached a pivotal moment. They began rethinking\
  \ web performance and userâ\x80\x99s perception of site responsivenessâ\x80¦ This\
  \ new philosophy led them to develop Navigation AI, a performance solution focused\
  \ on user experience rather than purely technical metrics. Around the same time,\
  \ NitroPack was acquired by WP Engine. As part of that acquisition, the emerging\
  \ Navigation AI project was spun out into a new company: Uxify."
