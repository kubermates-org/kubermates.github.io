  \ DigitalOceanâ\x80\x99s global program for startups that provides select technology\

  \x99s product experts for personalized guidance, priority technical support, and\

  \ and cost management simple, the Hatch program enables startups to build tech solutions\
  \ that make an impact. For Georgi Petrov and Mihail Stoychev, the co-founders and\
  \ serial entrepreneurs behind Uxify , choosing DigitalOcean to host their startupâ\x80\
  \x99s infrastructure was a no-brainer. They built their previous ventures NitroPack,\
  \ SMSBump, and iSenseLabs on DigitalOcean and could trust the platformâ\x80\x99\
  s simplicity, reliability, and user experience. When it came time to power Uxifyâ\x80\
  \x99s AI-enabled website performance solution and AI agent Uxi, they opted for DigitalOcean\
  \ again With Hatch program benefits like cloud credits and GPU Droplet discounts,\
  \ Uxify could focus on building and scaling their underlying AI infrastructure.\
  \ Uxifyâ\x80\x99s story begins over a decade ago with iSenseLabs, an agency that\
  \ provided services but also built and sold its own products. One of those products\
  \ was NitroPack, a performance optimization tool designed to help websites load\
  \ faster. As NitroPack gained traction, the team began seeing possibilities beyond\
  \ their current solution. Fast forward to 2024, the team behind NitroPack reached\
  \ a pivotal moment. They began rethinking web performance and userâ\x80\x99s perception\
  \ of site responsivenessâ\x80¦ This new philosophy led them to develop Navigation\
  \ AI, a performance solution focused on user experience rather than purely technical\
  \ metrics. Around the same time, NitroPack was acquired by WP Engine. As part of\
  \ that acquisition, the emerging Navigation AI project was spun out into a new company:\
  \ Uxify."
