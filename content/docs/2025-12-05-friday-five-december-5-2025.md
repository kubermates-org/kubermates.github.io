  collaborates with AWS to power enterprise-grade gen AI on AWS with Red Hat AI and
  AWS AI silicon. With this collaboration, Red Hat focuses on empowering IT decision-makers
  with the flexibility to run high-performance, efficient AI inference at scale, regardless
  of the underlying hardware. Learn more As we move from chatbots to autonomous AI
  agents, complexity is exploding. Red Hat’s Tushar Katarki joins Chris Wright to
  discuss building a "Kubernetes for Agents," the importance of the Model Context
  Protocol (MCP), and how to engineer platforms that get AI out of PoC purgatory and
  into production. Learn more Rising virtualization costs, licensing constraints,
  and operational complexity are driving teams to evaluate more flexible and cost-effective
  paths to the cloud. Red Hat OpenShift Virtualization, combined with Red Hat OpenShift
  Service on AWS, supports hardware overcommit in the cloud, allowing customers to
  run more VMs on fewer cloud resources. Learn more Red Hat will provide hardened
  container images to free and paying customers with new Project Hummingbird to help
  support “zero-CVE” software builds. The service releases to select customers in
  December ahead of a full rollout. Learn more Red Hat is positioning its open source
  platform as the foundation for companies navigating AI adoption and digital sovereignty.
  In a recent interview Ashesh Badani explained how the over-25-year-old open source
  philosophy now applies to the AI era, where choice and control matter more than
  ever. Learn more Red Hat is the world’s leading provider of enterprise open source
  solutions, using a community-powered approach to deliver high-performing Linux,
  cloud, container, and Kubernetes technologies.'
