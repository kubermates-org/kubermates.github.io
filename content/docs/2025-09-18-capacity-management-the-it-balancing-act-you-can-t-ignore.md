  VMware Cloud Foundation Ever feel like your IT resources are either bursting at
  the seams or sitting idle (and costing a fortune)? Welcome to the world of capacity
  management. In this post, we’ll break down what it really means, why it’s harder
  than it looks, and the common challenges that leave IT teams scrambling. At its
  core, capacity management is about making sure your IT resources—servers, storage,
  networks, and cloud services—are sized just right. Not too big, not too small. Think
  of it like budgeting: enough to get the job done today, with a plan for tomorrow.
  Here’s what goes into it: Monitoring usage: Keeping an eye on CPU, memory, storage,
  and bandwidth. Forecasting demand: Predicting spikes before they hit you. Optimizing
  resources: Moving workloads around or fine tuning performance. Strategic planning:
  Lining up IT with the bigger business picture.'
