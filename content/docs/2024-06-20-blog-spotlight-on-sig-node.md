  Opportunities Sidecar containers Contributing to SIG Node Conclusion In the world
  of container orchestration, Kubernetes reigns supreme, powering some of the most
  complex and dynamic applications across the globe. Behind the scenes, a network

  I have the privilege of speaking with Matthias Bertschy , Gunju Kim , and Sergey
  Kanzhelev , members of SIG Node , who will shed some light on their roles, challenges,
  and the exciting developments within SIG Node. Answers given collectively by all
  interviewees will be marked by their initials. Arpit: Thank you for joining us today.
  Could you please introduce yourselves and provide a brief overview of your roles
  within SIG Node? Matthias: My name is Matthias Bertschy, I am French and live next
  to Lake Geneva, near the French Alps. I have been a Kubernetes contributor since
  2017, a reviewer for SIG Node and a maintainer of Prow. I work as a Senior Kubernetes
