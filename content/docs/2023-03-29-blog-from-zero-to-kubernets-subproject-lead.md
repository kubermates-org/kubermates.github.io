summary: 'Getting started in any open-source community can be daunting, especially
  if it’s a big one like Kubernetes. I wrote this post to share my experience and
  encourage others to join up. All it takes is some curiosity and a willingness to
  show up! Here’s how my journey unfolded at a high level: First things first. What
  are you interested in learning more about? There are so many wonderful SIGs and
  working groups in the Kubernetes community: there’s something for everyone. And
  continuing to show up and participate will be so much easier if you think what you
  are doing is interesting. Likewise, continued participation is what keeps the community
  thriving, so that interest will drive you to have more of an impact. Also: it’s
  ok to show up knowing nothing! I remember showing up knowing very little about Kubernetes
  or how the community itself worked. And while I know more about how the community
  functions today, I am still learning all the time about it and the project. Fortunately,
  the community is full of friendly people who want to help you learn. Learning as
  you go is expected and celebrated. When you raise your hand to do something, even
  if you know nothing, people will cheer and help you along the way. This method was
  my exact story.'
