  in this post If you’ve been working with ArgoCD or exploring GitOps, you’ve probably
  come across the Certified Argo Project Associate (CAPA) exam. I recently passed
  it, and in this post, I want to share: Why I took the exam How I prepared (including
  all the resources I used) What the experience was like Whether I’d recommend it
  This isn’t a sales pitch. It’s a real-world guide to help you prepare — and understand
  whether this certification is right for you. I’ve been working with ArgoCD for over
  a year now as a senior cloud engineer. I’ve had first-hand experience managing real-world
  GitOps workflows, and designing deployment strategies using ArgoCD. However, the
  CAPA exam doesn’t just focus on ArgoCD. It covers four Argo projects : Argo Workflows
  Argo CD Argo Rollouts Argo Events While I had a solid foundation in GitOps and ArgoCD
  (which makes up 34% of the exam), I had little to no hands-on experience with Workflows,
  Rollouts, or Events — and that’s where most of my preparation efforts went. I prepared
  for the exam over the course of 1 month — with a focused, hands-on approach. Here’s
  the breakdown of how I studied and what resources I used: As a CNCF Ambassador,
  I had the opportunity to get the exam for free, and I also opted to purchase the
  “DevOps and Workflow Management with Argo (LFS256)” training course.'
