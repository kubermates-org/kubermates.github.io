  This milestone expands SQL Server''s footprint on Linux, giving developers and IT
  professionals more choices for modern, high-performance deployments. SQL Server
  2025 Preview is packed with AI and developer-friendly features, making RHEL 10 a
  great platform for experimentation. With RHEL 10 support, you can start validating
  SQL Server 2025 Preview in your development and test environments ahead of general
  availability. In addition to RHEL 10 support, SQL Server 2025 Preview introduces
  several exciting updates: Vector data type with support for half-precision floats
  (2-byte) for up to 3,996 dimensions in a single vector. Vector indexes for similarity
  search. External AI model management that integrates with REST inference endpoints
  and embedding tasks. Regular expressions : Use regex directly in SQL queries. JSON
  data type : Store, query, and transform JSON natively. External REST endpoint invocation
  : Call REST/GraphQL services directly from SQL Server. PolyBase on Linux now supports
  ODBC data sources.'
