  control of your Kubernetes security? Kubernetes adoption is growing, and managing
  secure and efficient network communication is becoming increasingly complex. With
  this growth, organizations need to enforce network policies with greater precision
  and care. However, implementing these policies without disrupting operations can
  be challenging. That’s where Calico Whisker comes in. It helps teams implement network
  policies that follow the principle of least privilege, ensuring workloads communicate
  only as intended. Since most organizations introduce network policies after applications
  are already running, safe and incremental rollout is essential. To support this,
  Calico Whisker offers staged network policies , which allow teams to preview a policy’s
  effect in a live environment before enforcing it.
