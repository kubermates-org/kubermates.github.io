  Automation 10. Kyverno Everywhere Conclusion FAQ: Kyverno vs Kubernetes Policies
  What is the difference between Kyverno and Kubernetes policies? Can Kyverno replace
  Kubernetes ValidatingAdmissionPolicy? Why do I need Kyverno if Kubernetes already
  has policies? With the addition of ValidatingAdmissionPolicy and MutatingAdmissionPolicy
  in Kubernetes, do you still need Kyverno? Quick Answer: Yes, you still need Kyverno.
  Kubernetes policies (ValidatingAdmissionPolicy, MutatingAdmissionPolicy) handle
  admission checks, but Kyverno extends them with reporting, testing, automation,
  and policy management at scale.'
