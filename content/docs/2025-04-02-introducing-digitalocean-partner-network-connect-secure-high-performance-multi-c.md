  \ read Growing businesses increasingly rely on multiple cloud providers and on-premise\
  \ infrastructure to scale their applications. However, connecting different cloud\
  \ environments securely and efficiently is a major headache. Many businesses struggle\
  \ with unpredictable latency and complex VPN setups to keep their distributed workloads\
  \ running smoothly. Without a seamless solution, managing cloud connectivity becomes\
  \ a costly and time-consuming burden. At DigitalOcean, weâ\x80\x99re committed to\
  \ helping to eliminate these challenges by making cloud networking simpler, more\
  \ scalable, and more accessible. Today, weâ\x80\x99re excited to introduce the general\
  \ availability of DigitalOcean Partner Network Connect, a cross-cloud connectivity\
  \ solution that enables more secure, high-performance networking between DigitalOcean\
  \ and other cloud providers or on-premise data centers. With Partner Network Connect,\
  \ growing businesses can establish direct, private connections between DigitalOcean\
  \ and other cloud providers or on-premise data centers or co-location facilitiesâ\x80\
  \x94bypassing the public internet to help improve security, minimize latency, and\
  \ increase network performance. By integrating with Megaport, a leading Network-as-a-Service\
  \ (NaaS) provider, weâ\x80\x99re helping our customers connect their distributed\
  \ workloads across multiple clouds easily, reliably, and affordably. As businesses\
  \ scale, they often deploy workloads across multiple cloud providers or maintain\
  \ hybrid cloud environments. Until now, cloud customers had to rely on VPNs or self-managed\
  \ solutions to connect these environments, which can be complex to set up, costly,\
  \ and difficult to maintain. DigitalOcean Partner Network Connect helps eliminate\
  \ these challenges for cloud-to-cloud and on-premise connectivity. Key benefits\
  \ include: Improved latency: Low latency, high-bandwidth private connectivity (1\
  \ Gbps to 10 Gbps) for faster, more reliable performance across cloud and on-premise\
  \ environments."
