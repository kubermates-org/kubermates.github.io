  projects highlighted in this post Learn how Kubernetes-native traffic management
  and SD-WAN integration can deliver consistent security, observability, and performance
  across distributed clusters. Modern businesses are rapidly adopting distributed
  architectures to meet growing demands for performance, resilience, and global reach.
  This shift is driven by emerging workloads that demand distributed infrastructure:
  AI/ML model training distributed across GPU clusters, real-time edge analytics processing
  IoT data streams, and global enterprise operations that require seamless connectivity
  across on-premises workloads, data centers, cloud providers, and edge locations.
  Today businesses are increasingly struggling to ensure secure, reliable and high-performance
  global connectivity while maintaining visibility across this distributed infrastructure.
  How do you maintain consistent end-to-end policies when applications traverse multiple
  network boundaries? How do you optimize performance for latency-sensitive critical
  applications when they could be running anywhere? And how do you gain clear visibility
  into application communication across this complex, multi-cluster, multi-cloud landscape?
  This is where a modern, integrated approach to networking becomes essential, one
  that understands both the intricacies of Kubernetes and the demands of wide-area
  connectivity. Let’s explore a proposal for seamlessly bridging your Kubernetes clusters,
  regardless of location, while intelligently managing the underlying network paths.
  Such an integrated approach solves several critical business needs: Unified security
  posture : Consistent policy enforcement from the wide-area network down to individual
  microservices. Optimized performance : Intelligent traffic routing that adapts to
  real-time conditions and application requirements. Global visibility : End-to-end
  observability across all layers of the network stack. In this post we discuss how
  to interconnect Cilium with a Software-Defined Wide Area Network (SD-WAN) fabric
  to extend Kubernetes-native traffic management and security policies into the underlying
  network interconnect. Learn how such integration simplifies operations while delivering
  the performance and security modern distributed workloads demand. Imagine a globally
  distributed service deployed across dozens of locations worldwide.'
