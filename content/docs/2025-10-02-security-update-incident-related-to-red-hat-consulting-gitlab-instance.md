  Infrastructure Applications Virtualization Share We are writing to provide an update
  regarding a security incident related to a specific GitLab environment used by our
  Red Hat Consulting team. Red Hat takes the security and integrity of our systems
  and the data entrusted to us extremely seriously, and we are addressing this issue
  with the highest priority. We recently detected unauthorized access to a GitLab
  instance used for internal Red Hat Consulting collaboration in select engagements.
  Upon detection, we promptly launched a thorough investigation, removed the unauthorized
  party’s access, isolated the instance, and contacted the appropriate authorities.
  Our investigation, which is ongoing, found that an unauthorized third party had
  accessed and copied some data from this instance. We have now implemented additional
  hardening measures designed to help prevent further access and contain the issue.
  We understand you may have questions about whether this incident affects you. Based
  on our investigation to date, we can share: Impact on Red Hat products and supply
  chain: At this time, we have no reason to believe this security issue impacts any
  of our other Red Hat services or products, including our software supply chain or
  downloading Red Hat software from official channels. Consulting customers: If you
  are a Red Hat Consulting customer, our analysis is ongoing. The compromised GitLab
  instance housed consulting engagement data, which may include, for example, Red
  Hat’s project specifications, example code snippets, and internal communications
  about consulting services. This GitLab instance typically does not house sensitive
  personal data. While our analysis remains ongoing, we have not identified sensitive
  personal data within the impacted data at this time.'
