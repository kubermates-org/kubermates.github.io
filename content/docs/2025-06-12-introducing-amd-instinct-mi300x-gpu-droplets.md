  \ Learn more about DigitalOcean GradientAI , our suite of AI products. At DigitalOcean,\
  \ weâ\x80\x99re committed to giving you even more options to power your AI/ML workloads.\
  \ Today, weâ\x80\x99re excited to announce that DigitalOcean customers now have\
  \ access to AMD Instinctâ\x84¢ MI300X as DigitalOcean GPU Droplets. AMD Instinctâ\x84\
  ¢ MI300X GPUs deliver leadership performance for accelerated high-performance computing\
  \ (HPC) applications and the newly exploding demands of generative AI. Use-cases\
  \ for these GPUs include large model training, fine-tuning, inference, and HPC.\
  \ With the AMD ROCmâ\x84¢ software platform, you can develop powerful HPC and AI\
  \ production-ready systems faster than ever before. AMD Instinctâ\x84¢ MI300Xâ\x80\
  \x99s large memory capacity allows it to hold models with hundreds of billions of\
  \ parameters entirely in memory, reducing the need for model splitting across multiple\
  \ GPUs. By combining powerful AMD AI compute engines and DigitalOceanâ\x80\x99s\
  \ cloud technologies, we aim to empower the massive community of developers like\
  \ you to integrate AI into your applications and support your most demanding AI\
  \ workloads at scale. Memory performance : High memory bandwidth (3. 35 TB/s) and\
  \ capacity (192 GB of HBM3) to efficiently handle larger models and datasets. Value:\
  \ Offered at a competitive price point ($1."
