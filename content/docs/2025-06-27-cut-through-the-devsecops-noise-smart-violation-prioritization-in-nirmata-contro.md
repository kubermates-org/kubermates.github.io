  Control Hub A TL;DR for Your K8s Cluster‚Äôs Health What to Fix First ‚Äì and Why How
  to Fix It: In-Line Remediation Guidance Tie It All Together with Jira Integration
  Get One Step Closer to a Secure, Governed K8s Cluster When managing security and
  compliance in Kubernetes, it‚Äôs easy to get overwhelmed. As a platform engineer or
  administrator, you might look at your cluster or namespace and find hundreds or
  even thousands of violations. But not all violations are created equal. Some are
  critical security risks that demand immediate attention, while others are best practices
  that can be addressed later. The problem? Without clear guidance, most teams end
  up doing nothing. Not because they don‚Äôt care ‚Äì but because they don‚Äôt know where
  to start. That‚Äôs exactly the problem we solve with Violation Summarization and Prioritization
  in Nirmata Control Hub. With Nirmata Control Hub, you don‚Äôt have to dig through
  pages of findings and all the time spent therein. With a timely glance, you get
  a summary report for your entire cluster or specific namespaces, showing: Total
  number of violations Affected namespaces Top security risks Recommended actions
  Nirmata Control Hub won‚Äôt just tell you what‚Äôs wrong. We prioritize violations into
  clear buckets: üî• Priority 1: Immediate Attention High-impact misconfigurations that
  expose your workloads to real risk ‚Äì fix these ASAP. üö® Priority 2: Important but
  Not Urgent Still important, but can be queued up for your next sprint. ‚ÑπÔ∏è Priority
  3: Minor / Best Practices Clean-up tasks and optimizations ‚Äì ideal for long-term
  hygiene.'
