summary: 'When managing security and compliance in Kubernetes, it’s easy to get overwhelmed.
  As a platform engineer or administrator, you might look at your cluster or namespace
  and find hundreds or even thousands of violations. But not all violations are created
  equal. Some are critical security risks that demand immediate attention, while others
  are best practices that can be addressed later. The problem? Without clear guidance,
  most teams end up doing nothing. Not because they don’t care – but because they
  don’t know where to start. That’s exactly the problem we solve with Violation Summarization
  and Prioritization in Nirmata Control Hub. With Nirmata Control Hub, you don’t have
  to dig through pages of findings and all the time spent therein. With a timely glance,
  you get a summary report for your entire cluster or specific namespaces, showing:
  Nirmata Control Hub won’t just tell you what’s wrong. We prioritize violations into
  clear buckets: This intelligent triage lets your team focus on what matters most
  – without getting distracted by noise. Every prioritized finding comes with clear
  remediation suggestions. For example: This built-in guidance significantly reduces
  the mean time to remediate (MTTR) – especially for large or complex environments.'
