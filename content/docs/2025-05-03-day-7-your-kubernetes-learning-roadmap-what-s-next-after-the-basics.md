summary: 'Youâ€™ve made it through: Youâ€™ve just unlocked the foundation of Kubernetes.
  But Kubernetes is big. Itâ€™s normal to now think: This post will give you the answer.
  Hereâ€™s a simple path we recommend: What to learn next: Tools: ðŸ‘‰ KodeKloud Kubernetes
  Free Labs ðŸ‘‰ Kubernetes Playground Goal: Be confident to deploy small apps on Kubernetes.
  What to explore: Tools: ðŸ‘‰ KodeKloud Kubernetes Learning Path Goal: Run small microservices
  apps in Kubernetes with persistence & scaling. What to master: Certification Tip:
  Start preparing for CKA (Certified Kubernetes Administrator). Tools: ðŸ‘‰ KodeKloud
  CKA Course ðŸ‘‰ Official Kubernetes Docs Goal: Be job-ready for DevOps & Cloud Native
  roles. We recommend keeping this simple checklist as your personal tracker : [ ]
  I understand Containers & Docker [ ] I know how to use kubectl [ ] I can create
  and manage Pods [ ] I know how Deployments & ReplicaSets work [ ] I can expose apps
  using Services [ ] I can manage ConfigMaps & Secrets [ ] I understand Clusters,
  Nodes, and the Control Plane [ ] I â€™ve tried Kubernetes labs or playgrounds [ ]
  Iâ€™ve deployed a real-world app in Kubernetes [ ] I â€™m exploring intermediate concepts
  (Volumes, Ingress, Monitoring) ðŸ‘‰ Pro tip: Print it or keep it in Notion/GitHub and
  check items off as you progress! Kubernetes is NOT something you master overnight.
  The key is consistent practice + real projects. Even learning these basics puts
  you ahead of most beginner engineers. Youâ€™ve started your Cloud Native journey â€”
  keep going. Weâ€™ll be here to help every step of the way.'
