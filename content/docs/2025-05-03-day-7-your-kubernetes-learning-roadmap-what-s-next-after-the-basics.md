  After Learning DevOps? What Is Kubernetes? Finally, a Simple Explanation! But Kubernetes
  is big. It’s normal to now think: This post will give you the answer. Here’s a simple
  path we recommend: What to learn next: Understand Namespaces ( kubectl get ns )
  kubectl get ns Practice creating Pods, Deployments, Services Play with ConfigMaps
  & Secrets Understand CrashLoopBackOff, Pending Pod errors Tools: 👉 KodeKloud Kubernetes
  Free Labs 👉 Kubernetes Playground Goal: Be confident to deploy small apps on Kubernetes.
  What to explore: Volumes & Persistent Storage Kubernetes Networking basics Rolling
  Updates & Rollbacks Horizontal Pod Autoscaling Tools: 👉 KodeKloud Kubernetes Learning
  Path Goal: Run small microservices apps in Kubernetes with persistence & scaling.
  What to master: Ingress Controllers Network Policies Pod Security & RBAC Monitoring
  with Prometheus + Grafana Troubleshooting broken apps in Kubernetes Helm charts
  for deploying apps Certification Tip: Start preparing for CKA (Certified Kubernetes
  Administrator). Tools: 👉 KodeKloud CKA Course 👉 Official Kubernetes Docs Goal: Be
  job-ready for DevOps & Cloud Native roles. We recommend keeping this simple checklist
  as your personal tracker : [ ] I understand Containers & Docker [ ] I know how to
  use kubectl [ ] I can create and manage Pods [ ] I know how Deployments & ReplicaSets
  work [ ] I can expose apps using Services [ ] I can manage ConfigMaps & Secrets
  [ ] I understand Clusters, Nodes, and the Control Plane [ ] I ’ve tried Kubernetes
  labs or playgrounds [ ] I’ve deployed a real-world app in Kubernetes [ ] I ’m exploring
  intermediate concepts (Volumes, Ingress, Monitoring) [ ] I [ ] I know how to [ ]
  I [ ] I [ ] I [ ] I [ ] I [ ] I [ ] I’ve deployed a [ ] I 👉 Pro tip: Print it or
  keep it in Notion/GitHub and check items off as you progress! Kubernetes is NOT
  something you master overnight. The key is consistent practice + real projects.
  Even learning these basics puts you ahead of most beginner engineers. 🔎 Keep practicing
  in the KodeKloud Playground 🎥 Watch Kubernetes beginner & intermediate videos on
  our KodeKloud YouTube channel 💻 Enroll in guided courses & labs on kodekloud. com
  You’ve started your Cloud Native journey — keep going. We’ll be here to help every
  step of the way.'
