  Virtualization Share Red Hat Ansible Automation Platform and HashiCorp have released
  two new Red Hat Ansible Certified Content Collections for HashiCorp Terraform and
  HashiCorp Vault: hashicorp. terraform and hashicorp. vault. These collections enhance
  automation with HashiCorp for securing and managing cloud infrastructure. The hashicorp.
  terraform collection integrates with HashiCorp Terraform for infrastructure lifecycle
  management, streamlining deployments, and supporting Infrastructure as Code (IAC)
  workflows. The hashicorp. vault collection will automate secrets management for
  authentication bolstering security. Both collections are certified by Red Hat, enabling
  reliability, enterprise support. The new hashicorp. terraform collection has been
  built from the ground up to provide API integration with HCP Terraform and Terraform
  Enterprise. This approach focuses on leveraging the APIs as the direct integration
  point, bringing a robust and efficient connection between Red Hat Ansible Automation
  Platform and your HashiCorp Terraform environments.'
