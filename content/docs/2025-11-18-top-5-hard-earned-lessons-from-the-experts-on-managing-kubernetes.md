  Building reliable, secure, and efficient Kubernetes Posted on November 18, 2025
  by Stevie Caldwell, Tech Lead at Fairwinds CNCF projects highlighted in this post
  Kubernetes has transformed how modern organizations deploy and operate scalable
  infrastructure, and the hype around automated cloud native orchestration has made
  its adoption nearly ubiquitous over the past 10+ years. Yet behind the scenes, most
  teams embarking on their Kubernetes journey quickly encounter operational complexity,
  configuration challenges, and costly maintenance that few vendors highlight. Drawing
  from years of real-world experience architecting, building, and maintaining Kubernetes,
  we recently hosted a webinar sharing five hard-earned lessons to help organizations
  get started using the container orchestration tool. In this post, we’ve paired each
  lesson with useful resources and examples of how to navigate managing Kubernetes
  at scale, whether supporting your own teams, deploying across multiple clusters,
  or evaluating managed Kubernetes offerings. The Kubernetes community knows that
  spinning up a cluster is straightforward, especially if you use a managed provider
  such as AKS , EKS , or GKE. But in reality, running a production environment means
  managing all the hidden add-ons : DNS controllers, networking, storage, monitoring,
  logging, secrets, security, and more. Supporting internal users (dev teams, ops,
  and data scientists) adds significant overhead for any company running Kubernetes.'
