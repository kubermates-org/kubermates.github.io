  Applications Virtualization Share General availability (GA) support is now available
  for Red Hat OpenShift versions 4.18, 4.19, and 4.20 running on VMware vSphere Foundation
  9 (VVF9) and VMware Cloud Foundation 9 (VCF9). As organizations continue to modernize
  their infrastructure, Red Hat remains committed to providing a stable, certified,
  and high-performance foundation for Kubernetes workloads across diverse environments.
  This announcement means that all current Red Hat customers deploying OpenShift on
  vSphere 8/vCenter 8 or VCF 5 can run their workloads on OpenShift clusters deployed
  on VVF9 or VCF9 as an infrastructure provider. With the introduction of VCF9, Broadcom
  has evolved its strategy to offer a comprehensive, all-in-one product suite. Red
  Hat has aligned its support to integrate with this new architecture. Customers deploying
  OpenShift clusters on top of VCF9 will use a standardized networking model: Infrastructure
  network provider : Powered by VMware NSX , helping to ensure robust connectivity
  at the hypervisor level. Overlay network : Powered by OVN-Kubernetes , providing
  the standard, agile networking layer required by OpenShift. For NSX Container Network
  Interface (CNI) integration, Red Hat uses the Partner certification process (see
  Red Hat Ecosystem Catalog ) to verify partner components are verified for compatibility
  with Red Hat products, maintaining the stability and security that our customers
  expect. To support the full lifecycle of your applications, we are also updating
  our management and storage compatibility for the VVF9 and VCF9 platforms. Red Hat
  Advanced Cluster Management for Kubernetes (ACM) 2.15.1+ supports both VVF9 and
  VCF9. This allows operations teams to manage their OpenShift fleet across these
  new VMware environments with the same governance, visibility, and control they use
  today. For customers utilizing OpenShift Data Foundation versions 4.19.7 and 4.20
  are available as a Technology Preview (TP) on VVF9 and VCF9.'
