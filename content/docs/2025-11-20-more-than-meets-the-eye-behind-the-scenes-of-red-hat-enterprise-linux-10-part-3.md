  Enterprise Linux 10. From the earliest conceptual stages to the launch at Red Hat
  Summit 2025, we’ll hear firsthand accounts of how RHEL 10 came into being. Part
  1 | Part 2 In our previous installment of the story of how Red Hat Enterprise Linux
  (RHEL) 10 came to be, we learned about a new approach to building the platform.
  In part 3, the team focuses on the delicate balancing act of keeping thousands of
  moving parts in sync while features like image mode and RHEL Lightspeed (and the
  stories we’ll tell about them) start to take shape. Mike McGrath, vice president,
  Core Platforms Engineering This is when things really start to kick into overdrive.
  The big thing that we watch for internally is what we call the compose. The compose
  is basically a nightly—or roughly, it could be a few times a day—build of the latest
  and greatest in RHEL. That’s what I always look to to see how things are going.
  Major Hayden, senior principal software engineer It’s kind of like a Jenga tower
  where all the pieces are slightly different sizes. And so you may look at it and
  say, ‘Well, my piece is really small. You can poke this thing out and nothing will
  fall. ’ And everyone around you is saying, ‘I believe you, but we’re going to have
  to check.'
