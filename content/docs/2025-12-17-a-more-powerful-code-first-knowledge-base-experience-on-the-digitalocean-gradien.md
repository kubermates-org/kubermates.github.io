  By Grace Morgan Updated: December 18, 2025 2 min read Building production-ready
  retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems can be complex, time-consuming, and
  often requires months of engineering effort. Developers and enterprises struggle
  to ingest diverse data sources, structure content for semantic search, and maintain
  accurate, verifiable answers. Enhancements to DigitalOcean Gradient™ AI Knowledge
  Bases , now in public preview , are designed to solve this problem. Its code-first
  feature lets developers create, manage, and query knowledge bases entirely from
  code, giving full control over ingestion, chunking, embedding, and retrieval without
  having to worry about the underlying infrastructure. Many existing solutions let
  developers create a basic knowledge base, but they often struggle to scale, customize,
  or integrate it into production workflows. The improvements address this by providing
  a code-first, developer-focused toolkit that handles the full knowledge base lifecycle.
  Developers can ingest data from files, Dropbox, web crawlers, control chunking and
  embedding strategies, and run natural language queries that return citation-backed
  answers with metadata filters. With well-documented APIs and SDKs, these integrations
  are seamless, letting developers manage everything entirely in code. The public
  preview highlights the essential tools developers need to build and manage knowledge
  bases effectively: Direct API Access: Query knowledge bases directly without needing
  an agent, giving full control for integration into apps or RAG pipelines. Customizable
  ingestion: Ingest content from supported sources such as files, web crawlers, and
  Dropbox datasets. Supports structured data, sitemap crawling, and accurate parsing
  of complex PDFs. Flexible chunking and embedding: Choose the chunking strategy that
  fits your content and select from high-performance embedding models (including a
  multi-lingual embedding model).'
