  Cloud Foundation (VCF) has always been about giving customers a single, integrated
  platform to build and operate their private cloud with consistency. But the requirements
  are evolving—and so must the platform. And VMware Cloud Foundation isn’t just adapting
  to enterprise transformation – it’s leading it. VCFis the engine driving how modern
  businesses reimagine their infrastructure, applications, and data strategies. Each
  new innovation isn’t a reaction to where the industry is going—it sets the pace
  for what’s possible in the private cloud – whether it’s in a central datacenter,
  edge or in the hyperscaler environment. VCF 9. 0 set the benchmark for the modern
  private cloud: Sovereign by Design – Data residency tags, geo-fencing, and automated
  certificate rotation to embed compliance into the platform. Operational Simplicity
  – New installer, unified fleet management, and streamlined lifecycle operations
  reduce deployment and maintenance overhead. Modern App Platform – vSphere Kubernetes
  Service and VM Service deliver VMs and containers side by side with GitOps-driven
  automation. Performance & Efficiency – NVMe memory tiering and global vSAN deduplication
  boost scale and flash efficiency at lower cost.'
