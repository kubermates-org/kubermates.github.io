summary: 'The private cloud is entering a new era. The workloads our infrastructure
  must serve have shifted from traditional applications only to also include distributed
  systems, data-intensive analytics, and AI-driven models that demand unprecedented
  agility and scale. VMware Cloud Foundation (VCF) has always been about giving customers
  a single, integrated platform to build and operate their private cloud with consistency.
  But the requirements are evolving—and so must the platform. And VMware Cloud Foundation
  isn’t just adapting to enterprise transformation – it’s leading it. VCFis the engine
  driving how modern businesses reimagine their infrastructure, applications, and
  data strategies. Each new innovation isn’t a reaction to where the industry is going—it
  sets the pace for what’s possible in the private cloud – whether it’s in a central
  datacenter, edge or in the hyperscaler environment. VCF 9. 0 set the benchmark for
  the modern private cloud: Missed it? What’s New In VMware Cloud Foundation 9. 0
  VCF 9. 0 was just the beginning of that journey. We’re here to solve the next set
  of challenges that the world of IT needs to overcome.'
