  Applications Virtualization Share We recently caught up with Kartikeya Baid Dwivedi
  (known as Kartik), a longtime Red Hatter with a varied career path and a passion
  for shaping great user experiences. Kartik currently leads the Core Platforms and
  Hybrid Cloud Infrastructure documentation teams. Additionally, Kartik is a member
  of the Czech Leadership Council. Along with sharing about his work in technical
  documentation and what led him to Red Hat, Kartik gives us some insights into his
  relocation from India to the Czech Republic, the impact of his work in the Czech
  Leadership Council, and his hobbies as a hobby pilot and sous chef. Consider us
  intrigued! Could you tell us about your current role and team? In my role in Customer
  Content Services (CCS), also known as the Docs team, I manage the Core Platforms
  and Hybrid Cloud Infrastructure documentation teams, which create product documentation
  for many products including Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL), Red Hat In-Vehicle
  Operating System (RHIVOS), Red Hat Satellite, Red Hat OpenStack, and Red Hat OpenShift
  Virtualization. I also dedicate time to the Czech Leadership Council, which supports
  associate engagement, strategic alignment, and leadership development across our
  Czech Republic office sites. Where are you currently based? Do you work remotely,
  in-person, or a bit of both? I live in lovely Brno, having moved there specifically
  for Red Hat in 2016. My wife and I fell in love with it. When I’m not traveling
  for work to the U. S. or India, I work in the Brno office between 3 and 4 days a
  week. Also, I’ve had the opportunity to visit approximately 20+ Red Hat offices
  worldwide so far! How did you start your career, and how did your journey lead you
  to Red Hat? I started my 20+ career as a web developer.'
