  Share Many organizations possess a wealth of unique internal knowledge. This includes
  customized operational runbooks, environment-specific configurations, internal best
  practices, and stringent compliance protocols. This information may be critical
  for the organization's day-to-day operations, but it sits outside public knowledge
  bases where large language models (LLM) are trained. There's a clear need to bridge
  this gap, and to enable an AI assistant to understand and leverage proprietary context
  and provide specific and actionable guidance. In response to this need, we introduced
  the "bring your own knowledge" (BYO knowledge) capability to Red Hat OpenShift Lightspeed.
  BYO knowledge empowers you to augment Lightspeed's intelligence with your organization's
  private documentation and internal expertise. This transforms OpenShift Lightspeed
  from a generally knowledgeable OpenShift expert into a highly specialized, context-aware
  partner. It's not just data, it's your data. The benefit of bringing your own data
  to AI is immediate and impactful.
