  Share Migration toolkit for virtualization 2.9 (MTV) release is here, and brings
  lots of new features to help make your virtual machine (VM) migration experience
  easier. This iteration introduces user experience enhancements designed to provide
  greater clarity, improved functionality, and a comprehensive view of your migration
  process. The enhanced UI of the migration toolkit 2.9 focuses on three pivotal areas:
  Enhanced overview page : Get a broader and more granular perspective on your migration
  progress. Clearer migration plan wizard : Your creation process will be smoother
  with expanded functionality and increased clarity. Improved plan monitoring experience
  : Get more precise status indicators and greater insight into ongoing migrations.
  These updates underscore our commitment to delivering a robust and intuitive migration
  solution. We invite you to explore how these new features in the migration toolkit
  for virtualization 2.9 optimizes your virtualization migration workflows. The overview
  page delivers a summary of your current migrations statuses in a clear and measurable
  way, using data charts to display information around: The number of virtual machines
  (VMs) that have successfully migrated, which migration is running, or which migration
  has failed over a given time frame. The number of migration plans that have succeeded,
  are running, or have failed over time. Migration history over time. Additions to
  the page also make it easier for first-time users to understand which source providers
  are supported by the migration toolkit for virtualization operator. It also allows
  users to create a source provider directly from this page, which is the first step
  in creating a migration plan.'
