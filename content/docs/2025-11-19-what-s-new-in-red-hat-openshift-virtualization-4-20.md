  Share Red Hat OpenShift Virtualization 4.20 is now generally available , helping
  organizations modernize their virtualization strategy with greater speed and confidence
  through expanded platform availability, enhanced virtual machine (VM) management,
  and new capabilities for hybrid cloud infrastructure. With networking enhancements,
  optimized live migration, and improved user experience, OpenShift Virtualization
  4.20 enables teams to deliver more agile, cloud-ready, and consistent operations
  wherever they choose to run their workloads. Our collaborations with customers and
  partners on their migration journeys have helped deliver significant value. Get
  an inside look from leaders at Ford and Emirates NBD on how their unified modern
  platform helped power critical workloads for their business. Additionally, you''ll
  learn how both companies benefit from an efficient, security-focused, and reliable
  infrastructure that integrates with their existing infrastructure, IT tooling, and
  development platforms, positioning them for success with newer projects like AI
  adoption and enablement. The strategic shift: How Ford and Emirates NBD stopped
  paying the complexity tax for virtualization With the release of OpenShift Virtualization
  4.20, customers can more easily extend their VM workloads from on-premise environments
  to multiple clouds, giving them greater flexibility as they modernize their infrastructure.
  As organizations work to simplify their platforms and reduce operational complexity,
  the general availability of OpenShift Virtualization on Azure Red Hat OpenShift
  offers a security-focused path forward. Built and backed jointly by Red Hat and
  Microsoft, this solution enables customers to migrate and run VMs alongside containers
  on a single, enterprise-grade platform. Tools such as the migration toolkit for
  virtualization and Red Hat Ansible Automation Platform help automate migrations
  from legacy systems with minimal disruption. This collaboration streamlines operations,
  strengthens security, and helps optimize cloud spending—empowering teams to modernize
  faster across hybrid and multicloud environments. Azure NetApp Files is also available
  in public preview as a storage option for this solution. Watch the demo below to
  see how you can now deploy your VMs on Azure Red Hat OpenShift.'
