  Share To CIOs and CISOs overseeing critical production systems, AI can seem chaotic:
  It’s a dynamic, constantly evolving ecosystem, where current certifications and
  standards may not apply the same way, if at all. But AI can’t be ignored - properly
  implementing and integrating an AI strategy can be a massive boon to the enterprise,
  but the key word is “properly. ” Red Hat has always been committed to having our
  platforms conform to the certification and standards requirements of enterprise
  IT across industries. AI is no different, so we’re pleased to announce that Red
  Hat OpenShift AI has successfully achieved ISO 42001 certification, the first international
  standard designed for establishing, implementing, maintaining and continually improving
  an AI management system (AIMS). ISO 42001 provides a comprehensive framework to
  help organizations manage the unique risks and opportunities of enterprise AI. With
  its robust security feature set, Red Hat OpenShift AI can deliver: Enhanced customer
  data protection tooling demonstrated through robust security and privacy controls
  within Red Hat OpenShift AI which provides tools to enable a customer to increase
  its security posture and data handling within the platform. Industry standard alignment
  through a proactive approach to compliance, helping Red Hat OpenShift AI keep pace
  with evolving industry and regulatory expectations. Platform maturity alongside
  a strong compliance posture, which is validated by a third-party audit confirming
  the maturity and effectiveness of Red Hat''s internal compliance framework for AI.
  This provides greater assurances to our customers and partners that our AI development
  and deployment processes are governed appropriately and with greater consistency.
  Red Hat OpenShift AI, as part of Red Hat AI , provides an AI platform for managing
  the AI/(ML lifecycle at scale across on-premise and public cloud environments. It
  brings together data scientists and developers, with oversight from IT, to develop,
  train and fine tune generative (gen AI) and predictive models, deliver AI-enabled
  applications and bring models from experiments to production faster. ISO 42001 is
  the latest example of Red Hat’s continual effort to maintain consistent standards
  compliance across our entire product portfolio, including AI platforms.'
