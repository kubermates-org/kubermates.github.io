  Virtualization Share AI has fundamentally disrupted the predictable rhythm of technology
  progression, forcing enterprises into an era of relentless, chaotic innovation.
  As a result, relying on resiliency —the ability to bounce back from disruption—is
  no longer enough. Organizations must focus on developing both adaptability and durability.
  AI is the ultimate stress test. The technology itself is not the greatest barrier—adopting
  and deploying AI exposes existing weaknesses in an organization''s cultural, strategic,
  and technological foundations. Successfully implementing AI at scale demands building
  an enterprise that can continuously deliver value and seize opportunities when the
  ground is constantly shifting beneath you. In this article, we outline a strategic
  framework to help you audit your organization''s AI readiness through 3 fundamental
  tests. Passing all 3 means your enterprise has progressed from being merely resilient
  to becoming truly durable and adaptable, increasing your competitive advantage in
  the era of AI. So what exactly do we mean by an adaptable and durable enterprise?
  Adaptability is an essential, dynamic skill that allows the organization to effectively
  manage the pace of change. It is the capacity to read the shifting market conditions,
  rapidly adjust resources and processes, and proactively realign strategy to seize
  emerging opportunities. An adaptable enterprise actively fosters a culture that
  rewards rapid innovation and equips people to thrive amidst change, not just endure
  it. Durability is a continuous state.'
