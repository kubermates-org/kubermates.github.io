  GenAI Agents on VCF with Private AI Services Today at VMware Explore’s general session
  you saw Chris Wolf demonstrate Intelligent Assist for VMware Cloud Foundation, providing
  AI-powered assistance for our users. In this blog, we’ll take a step behind the
  curtain to see how these capabilities are running in VCF, using AI features that
  our customers can also use to build their own AI experiences with their own private
  data. VMware Private AI services enable administrators to safely and securely import
  and share approved AI models (Model Gallery and Model Governance); scale and run
  Models as a Service for their organization (Model Runtime and ML API gateway); create
  Knowledge bases and regularly refresh data in a fully supported vector database
  for creating RAG applications (Data Indexing and Retrieval Service in partnership
  with Data Services Manager); and provide developers a UI where they can compose
  models, knowledge bases, and tools together to create Agents (Agent Builder). The
  Intelligent Assist service is using these capabilities to run the Intelligent Assist
  agent, and VCF engineering teams are using these services as a common AI platform
  to deliver joint services and AI workflows. Customers can also use these same capabilities
  for their own teams. These features give private cloud administrators what they
  need to safely download, validate, and share models with teams across their cloud.
  Learn about how to safely onboard popular models from upstream and ensure the model’s
  behavior meets your enterprises’ expectations and requirements – and behavior doesn’t
  drift over time in this blog post. Now that you have models securely imported and
  shared with the right folks in your organization, you will want to run them in an
  efficient and scalable way. Gone are the days of every division running their own
  separate copies of the same popular models – instead your team can provide Models
  as a Service using the Model Runtime. Deploy models on a fully maintained runtime
  stack from directly within VCF, and then horizontally scale them as they come under
  load with no end user impact, as users broker their requests via the ML API gateway.
  This also gives you flexibility to do rolling upgrades of models with zero end user
  impact. This method of deploying models allows separate lines of business or tenants
  within a Cloud Service Provider to keep their data separate from each other while
  ensuring high GPU utilization.
