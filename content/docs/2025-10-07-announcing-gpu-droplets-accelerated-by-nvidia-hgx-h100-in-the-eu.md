  \ Demand for high-performance computing resources, particularly for cutting-edge\
  \ training and inference workloads, continues to grow exponentially. We know that\
  \ developers and businesses across Europe need simple, localized access to powerful\
  \ GPUs to keep their innovation pipelines moving fast. Weâ\x80\x99re excited to\
  \ announce that NVIDIA HGX H100s as GPU Dropletsâ\x80\x94DigitalOceanâ\x80\x99s\
  \ on-demand, GPU-powered, virtual machinesâ\x80\x94are now available in our Amsterdam\
  \ data center. By integrating NVIDIA HGX H100 GPUs into an EU-based data center,\
  \ weâ\x80\x99re making it simpler for developers and digital native enterprises\
  \ to access cutting-edge performance with the simplicity and affordability youâ\x80\
  \x99ve come to expect from DigitalOcean. NVIDIA HGX H100 is a powerful GPU that\
  \ is known for its training speed. It covers a range of use cases, including training\
  \ LLMs, inference, and high-performance computing. Learn more about its full range\
  \ of capabilities> DigitalOcean customers are putting NVIDIA HGX H100s to the test\
  \ with complex use cases. WindBorne Systems, which operates the largest balloon\
  \ constellation in the world while also developing state-of-the-art deep learning\
  \ models for real-time forecasting, relies on NVIDIA HGX H100s on DigitalOcean for\
  \ training. Combining NVIDIAâ\x80\x99s state-of-technology with DigitalOceanâ\x80\
  \x99s resources, they found that DigitalOceanâ\x80\x99s infrastructure allowed them\
  \ to train models on H100s faster and more cost-effectively than other cloud options.\
