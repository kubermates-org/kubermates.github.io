  \ integration that brings the power of LangChain to DigitalOcean Gradient AI Platform.\
  \ LangChain is a popular framework for building applications powered by large language\
  \ models (LLMs), with tools for chaining prompts, managing context, and connecting\
  \ to external data sources. With this package, you can now seamlessly connect LangChainâ\x80\
  \x99s flexible orchestration framework to DigitalOceanâ\x80\x99s scalable, developer-friendly\
  \ AI infrastructureâ\x80\x94making it easier than ever to build, and scale AI-powered\
  \ applications. As AI adoption accelerates, developers are looking for ways to streamline\
  \ the process of building and deploying intelligent applications. LangChain has\
  \ been a go-to framework for chaining together LLMs, tools, and data sources. DigitalOcean\
  \ Gradient AI, meanwhile, offers a simple, cost-effective platform for running AI\
  \ workloads at scale. With langchain-gradient , you can now: Connect LangChain to\
  \ Gradient AI Platform : Use Gradient AI Platform as a provider within your LangChain\
  \ pipelines, unlocking ideas to production in just a few lines of code. Choose from\
  \ multiple model options: Instantly access multiple AI models with GPU-accelerated,\
  \ serverless inference on DigitalOcean. Stay open and flexible : The package is\
  \ fully open-source and designed to work with the latest versions of LangChain and\
  \ Gradient AI Platform. With LangChain and Gradient AI Platform working together,\
  \ you can: Build retrieval-augmented chatbots that pull knowledge from your own\
  \ files, databases, or cloud storage. Build retrieval-augmented chatbots that pull\
  \ knowledge from your own files, databases, or cloud storage. Automate customer\
  \ support workflows by chaining together intent detection, document search, and\
  \ AI-powered responses."
