summary: "By Narasimha Badrinath Weâ\x80\x99re excited to introduce langchain-gradient\
  \ , a new open-source integration that brings the power of LangChain to DigitalOcean\
  \ Gradient AI Platform. LangChain is a popular framework for building applications\
  \ powered by large language models (LLMs), with tools for chaining prompts, managing\
  \ context, and connecting to external data sources. With this package, you can now\
  \ seamlessly connect LangChainâ\x80\x99s flexible orchestration framework to DigitalOceanâ\x80\
  \x99s scalable, developer-friendly AI infrastructureâ\x80\x94making it easier than\
  \ ever to build, and scale AI-powered applications. As AI adoption accelerates,\
  \ developers are looking for ways to streamline the process of building and deploying\
  \ intelligent applications. LangChain has been a go-to framework for chaining together\
  \ LLMs, tools, and data sources. DigitalOcean Gradient AI, meanwhile, offers a simple,\
  \ cost-effective platform for running AI workloads at scale. With langchain-gradient\
  \ , you can now: With LangChain and Gradient AI Platform working together, you can:\
  \ Build retrieval-augmented chatbots that pull knowledge from your own files, databases,\
  \ or cloud storage. Automate customer support workflows by chaining together intent\
  \ detection, document search, and AI-powered responses. Create AI copilots for developers\
  \ or teams that summarize logs, generate code snippets, or draft documentation.\
  \ Experiment faster with different LLMs for tasks like summarization, classification,\
  \ or content generationâ\x80\x94then scale instantly with serverless inference.\
  \ You can install the package directly from PyPI. For step-by-step installation\
  \ instructions and setup guidance, visit the PyPI page or DigitalOcean Gradient\
  \ page in LangChain."
