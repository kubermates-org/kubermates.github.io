summary: 'Spotlight on Policy Working Group Introduction About Working Groups Policy
  WG Challenges (Note: The Policy Working Group has completed its mission and is no
  longer active. This article reflects its work, accomplishments, and insights into
  how a working group operates. ) In the complex world of Kubernetes, policies play
  a crucial role in managing and securing clusters. But have you ever wondered how
  these policies are developed, implemented, and standardized across the Kubernetes
  ecosystem? To answer that, let’s take a look back at the work of the Policy Working
  Group. The Policy Working Group was dedicated to a critical mission: providing an
  overall architecture that encompasses both current policy-related implementations
  and future policy proposals in Kubernetes. Their goal was both ambitious and essential:
  to develop a universal policy architecture that benefits developers and end-users
  alike. Through collaborative methods, this working group strove to bring clarity
  and consistency to the often complex world of Kubernetes policies. By focusing on
  both existing implementations and future proposals, they ensured that the policy
  landscape in Kubernetes remains coherent and accessible as the technology evolves.
  This blog post dives deeper into the work of the Policy Working Group, guided by
  insights from its former co-chairs: Jim Bugwadia Poonam Lamba Andy Suderman Interviewed
  by Arujjwal Negi. These co-chairs explained what the Policy Working Group was all
  about. Hello, thank you for the time! Let’s start with some introductions, could
  you tell us a bit about yourself, your role, and how you got involved in Kubernetes?
  Jim Bugwadia : My name is Jim Bugwadia, and I am a co-founder and the CEO at Nirmata
  which provides solutions that automate security and compliance for cloud-native
  workloads. At Nirmata, we have been working with Kubernetes since it started in
  2014.'
