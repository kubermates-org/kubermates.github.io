summary: 'I’m super excited to announce the 3. 0 beta of Jenkins X! Christmas has
  come early this year! the main documentation of the changes are: but here’s a brief
  summary of the differences: As a user the high level UX of Jenkins X is similar:
  We have been using Jenkins X 3. x in production now for many months (for CI/CD of
  all of the 3. x codebase and continuously upgrading our cluster in the standard
  way and it’s been much simpler and easier to use, operate and configure. In general
  Jenkins X 3. x is now much simpler and more flexible. It supports lots more platforms
  than before and should be easy to extend and configure for other platforms too.
  If you have never tried 3. x before then please follow the Admin Guide to get Jenkins
  X installed on your cloud provider, on-premises kubernetes cluster or minikube.
  If you previously tried the 3. x alpha then the migration instructions are here.
  For folks on older 2.'
