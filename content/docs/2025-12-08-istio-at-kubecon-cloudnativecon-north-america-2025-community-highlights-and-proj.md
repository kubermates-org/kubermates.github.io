  CloudNativeCon North America 2025 lit up Atlanta from November 10–13, bringing together
  one of the largest gatherings of open-source practitioners, platform engineers,
  and maintainers across the cloud native ecosystem. For the Istio community, the
  week was defined by packed rooms, long hallway conversations, and a genuine sense
  of shared progress across service mesh, Gateway API, security, and AI-driven platforms.
  Before the main conference began, the community kicked things off with Istio Day
  on November 10, a colocated event filled with deep technical sessions, migration
  stories, and future-looking discussions that set the tone for the rest of the week.
  Istio Day brought together practitioners, contributors, and adopters for an afternoon
  of learning, sharing, and open conversations about where service mesh, and Istio,
  are headed next. Istio Day opened with welcome remarks from the program co-chairs,
  setting the tone for an afternoon focused on real-world mesh evolution and the rapid
  growth of the Istio community. The agenda highlighted three major themes driving
  Istio’s future: AI-driven traffic patterns , the advancement of Ambient Mesh—including
  multicluster adoption , and modernizing traffic entry with Gateway API. Speakers
  across the ecosystem shared practical lessons on scaling, migration, reliability,
  and operating increasingly complex workloads with Istio. The co-chairs closed the
  day by recognizing the speakers, contributors, and a community continuing to push
  service-mesh innovation forward. Recordings of all sessions are available at the
  CNCF YouTube channel. Outside of Istio Day, the project was highly visible across
  KubeCon + CloudNativeCon Atlanta, with maintainers, end users, and contributors
  sharing technical deep dives, production stories, and cutting-edge research. Istio
  appeared not only across expo booths and breakout sessions, but also throughout
  several of the keynotes, where companies showcased how Istio plays a critical role
  in powering their platforms at scale. The week’s momentum fully met its stride when
  the Istio community reconvened with the Istio Project Update , where project leads
  shared latest releases and roadmap advances.'
