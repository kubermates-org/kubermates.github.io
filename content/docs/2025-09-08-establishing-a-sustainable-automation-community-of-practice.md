  Virtualization Share A community of practice is a collaborative framework in which
  stakeholders across teams unify efforts to build automation capabilities. The community
  of practice fosters cross-functional communication, standardizes automation practices,
  and accelerates innovation through the sharing of knowledge, ideas, and lessons
  learned. It serves as a hub across disparate yet adjacent teams for the reuse of
  solutions and the development of consistent operational models. Note: The terms
  center of excellence, community of excellence, and community of practice are often
  used interchangeably within the industry. You can learn more about how Red Hat differentiates
  between a center of excellence and a community of practice in this blog. Regardless
  of terminology used, what''s most important is to focus on the right approaches,
  activities, and outcomes. Recently, Red Hat partnered with a government organization
  to establish a structured automation community of practice that would unify automation
  efforts across disparate technical teams. Initial challenges Before the implementation
  of the community of practice, the organization experienced significant challenges
  due to a lack of standardization, including redundant automation development use
  cases, minimal cross-team collaboration and knowledge sharing, and increased time
  and budget costs associated with supporting multiple tools and frameworks. Once
  the community of practice was in place, designated representatives from different
  domains began meeting regularly to: Share automation progress, blockers, and lessons
  learned. Collaboratively troubleshoot and review each other’s work. Align on reusable
  automation content and development standards. Using the learnings from the government
  organization, you can establish your own automation communities of practice.'
