  Share We are 2 years in on a strategic shift in virtualization. Although this shift
  created some initial panic, most customers have taken advantage of this shift as
  an opportunity to make a more strategic decision on where they want to go on their
  virtualization journey. Red Hat OpenShift Virtualization is built on innovation,
  where customer needs inspire our engineers to deliver high-impact solutions to help
  them move from concept to general availability in a matter of months, not years.
  It’s no surprise that this commitment to rapid, customer-focused innovation earned
  OpenShift Virtualization the 2025 CRN Innovator Award for the launch of Red Hat
  OpenShift Virtualization Engine , a virtualization-only edition for Red Hat OpenShift.
  The engineering team velocity is one of the core reasons OpenShift Virtualization
  has become a trusted platform for many of the top enterprises across the world.
  Customer feedback backs the confidence in our platform, with one customer calling
  out that the product enhancements they had asked for at the beginning of a proof
  of concept (POC) were actually delivered by the time the POC was finishing. To us,
  that’s trusted, enterprise-ready innovation! Beyond comprehensive engineering skills,
  this velocity requires 2 more things: A profound understanding of the space and
  customer goals , which we provide through our engineers meeting with customers,
  getting real time feedback on platform capabilities, and together, shaping the outcomes
  for a given project. Mature technologies and knowing how to harness them into a
  cloud-native solution , driven by our nearly 2 decades of KVM virtualization experience
  and many years of Kubernetes expertise. Combined, our engineering teams are capable
  of reimagining a virtualization suite which augments and complements Kubernetes
  at every technology and stack layer. Additionally, combining Red Hat OpenShift and
  Red Hat Ansible Automation Platform can increase customers’ overall level of automation.
  OpenShift features like GitOps help automate the infrastructure management of adding
  nodes and maintenance of the infrastructure. Ansible Automation Platform collections
  automate Day 2 VM operations such as patch management.'
