  Share Kubernetes has emerged as a powerful foundation for deploying and managing
  cloud-native applications, and Red Hat OpenShift operators are the best way to streamline
  this. DH2i''s DxOperator, the SQL Server Operator bundled with DxEnterprise and
  preferred by Microsoft for Kubernetes deployments, is now officially certified for
  OpenShift 4.19, and it''s available from the Red Hat Ecosystem Catalog. This compliments
  the recent RHEL 9.6 certification for DxEnterprise. The Openshift certification
  for DxOperator marks another milestone in delivering enterprise-grade solutions
  for customers running Microsoft SQL Server in containerized and hybrid cloud environments.
  Together, Red Hat and DH2i are simplifying how organizations deploy, manage, and
  scale SQL Server workloads, bringing together the best of two worlds. Customers
  can now enjoy greater automation, high availability, and operational consistency
  when using OpenShift in the Microsoft space. DxOperator is the SQL Server Operator
  for Kubernetes endorsed by Microsoft. It''s designed to automate the entire lifecycle
  of cloud-native Microsoft SQL Server Always-On Availability Group (AG) operations.
  It allows enterprises to take advantage of the scalability and automation of Kubernetes
  while maintaining the reliability and performance expected from SQL Server. Cloud-native
  design: Built on cloud-native principles such as microservice architecture, immutable
  infrastructure, and declarative configuration. DxOperator integrates easily into
  OpenShift, enabling standardized deployment pipelines and simplified lifecycle management.
  Advanced architecture: Leveraging DH2i’s patented clustering technology, DxOperator
  unlocks true cross-platform database management.'
