  \ read Kubernetes is the foundation of many modern applications, providing the scalability\
  \ and resilience needed for todayâ\x80\x99s dynamic workloads. However, as applications\
  \ grow, so do their infrastructure and scaling requirements. Managing multiple clusters\
  \ to handle large-scale workloads introduces operational complexity, increased network\
  \ management, and challenges for the DevOps teams. These challenges can include\
  \ greater resource fragmentation, increased latency due to inter-cluster communication,\
  \ and the manual burden of maintaining security and compliance across multiple clusters.\
  \ These challenges are particularly pronounced for data-intensive workloads like\
  \ video streaming, large-scale data analytics, and security operations. Thatâ\x80\
  \x99s why weâ\x80\x99re excited to announce a major evolution of DigitalOcean Kubernetes\
  \ Service (DOKS), which consists of four features: Increased cluster capacity to\
  \ 1,000 worker nodes per cluster Increased cluster capacity to 1,000 worker nodes\
  \ per cluster Optimized networking with VPC-native Kubernetes Optimized networking\
  \ with VPC-native Kubernetes Improved performance with eBPF-powered networking Improved\
  \ performance with eBPF-powered networking Managed Cilium for high-performance networking\
  \ Managed Cilium for high-performance networking These updates help to empower businesses\
  \ to run larger workloads within a single DOKS cluster, reducing the need for complex\
  \ multi-cluster management and unlocking new levels of performance, reliability,\
  \ and simplicity. NoBid, a Kubernetes customer who joined us at Deploy 2025, has\
  \ seen significant improvements in scalability and security when deploying DOKS.\
  \ â\x80\x9CDigitalOcean Kubernetes provides NoBid with a powerful platform for our\
  \ containerized workloads,\" said Shawn Petersen, CIO at NoBid. â\x80\x9CAdditionally,\
  \ the ability to rapidly scale based on business demand, handle 1. 3 PB/month in\
  \ data egress, along with better security controls were all key differentiators\
  \ for us to partner with DigitalOcean. \" If you want to learn more about NoBidâ\x80\
  \x99s use case, check out their case study. Also, you can learn more about their\
  \ migration from AWS to DigitalOcean and their subsequent 30% cost-savings by watching\
  \ the testimonial they gave at Deploy 2025."
