summary: In the ever-changing landscape of Kubernetes, ensuring that clusters operate
  as intended is essential. This is where conformance testing becomes crucial, verifying
  that a Kubernetes cluster meets the required standards set by the community. Today,
  we’re thrilled to introduce Hydrophone , a lightweight runner designed to streamline
  Kubernetes tests using the official conformance images released by the Kubernetes
  release team. Hydrophone’s design philosophy centers around ease of use. By starting
  the conformance image as a pod within the conformance namespace, Hydrophone waits
  for the tests to conclude, then prints and exports the results. This approach offers
  a hassle-free method for running either individual tests or the entire Conformance
  Test Suite. In the Kubernetes world, where providers like EKS, Rancher, and k3s
  offer diverse environments, ensuring consistent experiences is vital. This consistency
  is anchored in conformance testing, which validates whether these environments adhere
  to Kubernetes community standards. Historically, this validation has either been
  cumbersome or requires third-party tools. Hydrophone offers a simple, single binary
  tool that streamlines running these essential conformance tests. It’s designed to
  be user-friendly, allowing for straightforward validation of Kubernetes clusters
  against community benchmarks, ensuring providers can offer a certified, consistent
  service. Hydrophone doesn’t aim to replace the myriad of Kubernetes testing frameworks
  out there but rather to complement them.
