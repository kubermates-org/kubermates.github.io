summary: "By Grace Morgan DigitalOceanâ\x80\x99s GenAI Platform is now DigitalOcean\
  \ Gradient Platform. Learn more about the GA release and features. In order to scale\
  \ AI applications, developers often end up spending more time wrangling infrastructure,\
  \ scaling for unpredictable traffic, or juggling multiple model providers than actually\
  \ building. Donâ\x80\x99t even get us started on fragmented billing. Serverless\
  \ inference, now available on the DigitalOcean GenAI Platform , removes all of that\
  \ complexity. It gives you a fast, low-friction way to integrate powerful models\
  \ from providers like OpenAI, Anthropic, and Meta, without provisioning infrastructure\
  \ or managing multiple keys and accounts. Serverless inference is one of the simplest\
  \ ways to integrate AI models into your application. No infrastructure, no setup,\
  \ no hassle. Whether youâ\x80\x99re building a recommendation engine, chatbot, or\
  \ another AI-powered feature, you get direct access to powerful models through a\
  \ single API. Itâ\x80\x99s built for simplicity and scalability: nothing to provision,\
  \ no clusters to manage, and automatic scaling to handle unpredictable workloads.\
  \ You stay focused on building, while we handle the rest. With the newest feature,\
  \ you get: Itâ\x80\x99s a low-friction, cost-efficient way to embed AI features\
  \ into your product, ideal for teams who want full control over the experience and\
  \ integration."
