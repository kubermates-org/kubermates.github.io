  \x99s GenAI Platform is now DigitalOcean Gradient Platform. Learn more about the\
  \ GA release and features. In order to scale AI applications, developers often end\
  \ up spending more time wrangling infrastructure, scaling for unpredictable traffic,\
  \ or juggling multiple model providers than actually building. Donâ\x80\x99t even\
  \ get us started on fragmented billing. Serverless inference, now available on the\
  \ DigitalOcean GenAI Platform , removes all of that complexity. It gives you a fast,\
  \ low-friction way to integrate powerful models from providers like OpenAI, Anthropic,\
  \ and Meta, without provisioning infrastructure or managing multiple keys and accounts.\
  \ Serverless inference is one of the simplest ways to integrate AI models into your\
  \ application. No infrastructure, no setup, no hassle. Whether youâ\x80\x99re building\
  \ a recommendation engine, chatbot, or another AI-powered feature, you get direct\
  \ access to powerful models through a single API. Itâ\x80\x99s built for simplicity\
  \ and scalability: nothing to provision, no clusters to manage, and automatic scaling\
  \ to handle unpredictable workloads. You stay focused on building, while we handle\
  \ the rest. With the newest feature, you get: Unified simple model access with one\
  \ API key Fixed endpoints for reliable integration Centralized usage monitoring\
  \ and billing Support for unpredictable workloads without pre-provisioning Usage-based\
  \ pricing with no idle infrastructure costs Itâ\x80\x99s a low-friction, cost-efficient\
  \ way to embed AI features into your product, ideal for teams who want full control\
  \ over the experience and integration."
