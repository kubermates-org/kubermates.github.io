  Virtualization Share In the rapidly evolving landscape of enterprise Kubernetes
  deployments, managing cognitive load and operational complexity is a significant
  challenge. As platform teams scale to support hundreds of development teams across
  multiple clusters, they face the mental overhead of managing disparate tools, inconsistent
  processes, and fragmented workflows. After extensive evaluation and real-world testing,
  a leading insurance organization has refined their approach using 5 key tenets that
  significantly reduce cognitive load and operational complexity while improving security,
  reliability, and developer experience. This blog post outlines how they transformed
  their platform strategy and the impact of choosing specific tools. The Challenge:
  Developers were spending considerable time determining namespace availability across
  our multicluster environment. The manual process of checking multiple clusters,
  understanding naming conventions, and avoiding conflicts drained productivity significantly.
  Solution: Red Hat Advanced Cluster Security Why Red Hat Advanced Cluster Security?
  Initially adopted for security compliance, Red Hat Advanced Cluster Security demonstrates
  an unexpected benefit: its comprehensive visibility into cluster resources provided
  the precise, cluster-wide visibility needed for namespace management.'
