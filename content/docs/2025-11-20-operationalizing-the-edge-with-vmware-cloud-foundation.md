  Operationalizing the Edge with VMware Cloud Foundation VMware Cloud Foundation is
  the Gold Standard for Virtual Desktop Infrastructure VCF Breakroom Chats Episode
  73 - Next-Gen Data Services: The DBaaS Revolution with VCF 9 As organizations extend
  operations beyond the data center, the edge has become a vital part of their digital
  strategy. Whether in retail outlets, manufacturing plants, healthcare facilities,
  energy plants or remote branch offices, IT teams want infrastructure that delivers
  cloud like agility, consistency and unified operations in the most resource-constrained
  environments. With VMware Cloud Foundation 9.0 for Edge, a single-host edge site
  deployment powered by VMware vSphere Supervisor enables organizations to run both
  VMs and container workloads on the same platform, eliminating the need for separate
  infrastructure and reducing cost and operational complexity in resource-constrained
  edge environments. VCF 9.0 also introduces a GitOps model powered by Argo CD Operator,
  using a centrally managed Git repository as the source of truth, organizations can
  drive consistent, repeatable and automatically reconciled deployments of VMs and
  container workloads across multiple distributed edge sites from a single repository
  simplifying and scaling management across thousands of edge sites. The journey to
  modernize the edge, as we’ve explored in our previous posts, has paved the way for
  robust, simplified infrastructure. We’ve introduced the power of the single-node
  vSphere Supervisor architecture in our series, starting with the Modernizing Your
  Edge with Single Node vSphere Supervisor blogs. Following that, we demonstrated
  how application deployment at scale is achieved using a GitOps approach with Argo
  CD in VCF 9.0 for Edge – Automating App Deployment at Scale with GitOps Using Argo
  CD. Now, it’s time to bring these concepts together and address the crucial next
  step: accelerating the infrastructure deployment itself. A core challenge for distributed
  edge sites is the consistent, rapid, and error-free provisioning of the underlying
  hardware and software stack. A fully automated deployment script is now available,
  enabling customers to deploy a single-host vSphere Supervisor environment with Argo
  CD automation. Automating deployment of vSphere Supervisor and Argo CD at scale
  minimizes setup time, standardizes configurations, and improves consistency across
  distributed edge locations. This new automation script streamlines everything from
  initial cluster configuration to continuous application delivery, helping organizations
  operationalize the edge faster and more reliably.'
