summary: 'Spotlight on SIG Apps Introductions About SIG Apps Best practices and challenges
  Contributing to SIG Apps Looking ahead In our ongoing SIG Spotlight series, we dive
  into the heart of the Kubernetes project by talking to the leaders of its various
  Special Interest Groups (SIGs). This time, we focus on SIG Apps , the group responsible
  for everything related to developing, deploying, and operating applications on Kubernetes.
  Sandipan Panda ( DevZero ) had the opportunity to interview Maciej Szulik ( Defense
  Unicorns ) and Janet Kuo ( Google ), the chairs and tech leads of SIG Apps. They
  shared their experiences, challenges, and visions for the future of application
  management within the Kubernetes ecosystem. Sandipan: Hello, could you start by
  telling us a bit about yourself, your role, and your journey within the Kubernetes
  community that led to your current roles in SIG Apps? Maciej : Hey, my name is Maciej,
  and I’m one of the leads for SIG Apps. Aside from this role, you can also find me
  helping SIG CLI and also being one of the Steering Committee members. I’ve been
  contributing to Kubernetes since late 2014 in various areas, including controllers,
  apiserver, and kubectl. Janet : Certainly! I’m Janet, a Staff Software Engineer
  at Google, and I’ve been deeply involved with the Kubernetes project since its early
  days, even before the 1. 0 launch in 2015. It’s been an amazing journey! My current
  role within the Kubernetes community is one of the chairs and tech leads of SIG
  Apps. My journey with SIG Apps started organically. I started with building the
  Deployment API and adding rolling update functionalities.'
