  Hat Satellite 6.18 is now generally available (GA), with new AI and system monitoring
  and management capabilities to streamline IT operations and simplify Linux administration.
  This release continues to build on our commitment to providing a unified management
  solution across on-premise, hybrid cloud, and public cloud environments. Key updates
  in Red Hat Satellite 6.18 focus on three areas: AI-powered tools, system health,
  and content management features. Satellite 6.18 introduces new AI-powered features
  designed to streamline Linux administration. These functionalities aim to increase
  efficiency for all IT professionals, regardless of your experience level. The new
  model context protocol (MCP) server, released as a technology preview, allows you
  to query Satellite for information using natural language. This eliminates the need
  for specific query syntax, or significant manual effort. You can efficiently generate
  reports on patching requirements, categorize patches, and filter lists by environment
  with a natural language query to an MCP client connected to the MCP server. The
  command-line assistant, first introduced in Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) 10 and
  launched earlier in 2025, offers natural language answers directly from the command
  line. Included with Satellite 6.18 is the developer preview offline version of the
  command-line assistant. This offline command-line assistant is packaged and runs
  as containers, enabling local queries without the need for external network connectivity.
  This is particularly beneficial for organizations in sectors such as government,
  finance, and industrial control, where cloud access is restricted.'
