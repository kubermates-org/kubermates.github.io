tldr: How Can Teams Better Manage the Kubernetes Blast Radius and Skills Gap? How
  Does Calico AI Simplify Kubernetes Operations Through Conversation? Why Does Support
  for Istio Ambient Mode Matter for Unified Kubernetes Security? What Challenges Do
  AI Agents Introduce for Kubernetes Security? Why Are Enterprises Accelerating VM
  to Kubernetes Migrations? What Comes Next for Kubernetes Security and AI-driven
  Operations? Ready to Go Deeper on Calico AI and Kubernetes Security? Platform teams
  are tasked with keeping clusters secure and observable while navigating a skills
  gap. At KubeCon + CloudNativeCon North America, The New Stack spoke with Ratan Tipirneni,
  President and CEO of Tigera, about the future of Kubernetes security, AI-driven
  operations, and emerging trends in enterprise networking.

  President and CEO of Tigera, about the future of Kubernetes security, AI-driven
  operations, and emerging trends in enterprise networking. The highlights from that
  discussion are summarized below. Portions of this article are adapted from a recorded
  interview between The New Stack’s Heather Joslin and Tigera CEO Ratan Tipirneni.
  You can watch the full conversation on The New Stack’s YouTube channel. Watch the
  full interview here Tipirneni emphasizes the importance of controlling risk in Kubernetes
  clusters. “You want to be able to microsegment your workloads so that if you do
  come under an attack, you can actually limit the blast radius,” he says. Egress
  traffic is another area of concern. According to Tipirneni, identifying what leaves
  the cluster is critical for security and compliance. Platform engineers are often
  navigating complex configurations without decades of networking experience. “Calico
  AI is a great mechanism to help them understand some of the nuances and intricacies
  of how to troubleshoot these things without having to get a PhD in networking,”
  Tipirneni explains. Tigera’s new Calico AI aims to make cluster operations more
  approachable.
