  AI/ML Performance VMware Cloud Foundation (VCF) offers a comprehensive suite of
  software-defined services, enabling enterprises to build reliable and efficient
  cloud infrastructure with consistent operations across diverse environments. The
  latest addition to this platform is VCF Private AI Services , a secure set of services
  for deploying AI applications using models and data sources. VCF Private AI Services
  integrates with VCF Automation to provide a simplified, cloud-like experience that
  allows users to deploy models into production easily, often within minutes. For
  instance, the workflow for deploying model endpoints is available in the VCF Automation
  UI, as shown below. Without VCF Automation, deploying model endpoints to a namespace
  would require using VCF Consumption Command Line Interface (VCF Consumption CLI)
  and kubectl.'
