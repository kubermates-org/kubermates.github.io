  Applications Virtualization Share Ireland has a strong digital infrastructure public
  services record, with momentum behind cloud adoption and artificial intelligence.
  The upcoming update to the National Digital and AI Strategy in 2025 reflects a continued
  commitment to innovation, not just for economic competitiveness, but for better,
  more responsive public services. To sustain this progress and ensure impact across
  the economy and society, Irish organisations – particularly in the public sector
  – will need to take a pragmatic, outcome-led approach to AI adoption. One that prioritises
  strategic digital skills, cross-sector collaboration, and AI solutions that are
  scalable and energy-efficient. Recent Red Hat research shows that nearly all IT
  managers in Ireland plan to increase investment in both cloud (93%) and AI (95%)
  this year. The intent is clear. But the challenge is now delivery: how to turn national
  ambition into measurable outcome, so that all areas of Irish industry can develop
  an AI toolbox fit for purpose. This is pressing in sectors like healthcare, agriculture
  and planning, where digital transformation is essential to improving public services,
  managing environmental resources and addressing infrastructure demands in a growing
  population. Ireland’s AI use is growing - its application across enterprises grew
  from 8% in 2023 to 14% in 2024. Laying the foundations for connected AI One of the
  biggest barriers to delivering progress with AI is structural. Ireland’s public
  sector is under pressure to improve the speed and quality of service delivery, often
  while maintaining or modernising legacy systems. Teams are expected to adopt new
  technologies, collaborate more effectively and respond to rapidly changing citizen
  expectations.'
