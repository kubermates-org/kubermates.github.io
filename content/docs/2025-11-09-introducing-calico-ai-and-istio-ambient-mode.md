  Next Steps: See Calico in Action 👇 Kubernetes has transformed how teams build and
  scale applications, but it has also introduced new layers of complexity. Platform
  and DevOps teams must now integrate and manage multiple technologies: CNI, ingress
  and egress gateways, service mesh, and more across increasingly large and dynamic
  environments. As more applications are deployed into Kubernetes clusters, the operational
  burden on these teams continues to grow, especially when maintaining performance,
  reliability, security, and observability across diverse workloads. To address this
  complexity and tool sprawl, Tigera is incorporating Istio’s Ambient Service Mesh
  directly into the Calico Unified Network Security Platform. Service mesh has become
  the preferred solution for application-level networking, particularly in environments
  with a large number of services or highly regulated workloads. Among available service
  meshes, Istio stands out as the most popular and widely adopted, supported by a
  thriving open-source community. By leveraging the lightweight, sidecarless design
  of Istio Ambient Mode, Calico delivers all the benefits of service mesh, secure
  service-to-service communication, mTLS authentication, L7 traffic management, and
  observability, without the burden of sidecars. Complementing this addition is Calico
  AI. Calico AI brings intelligence and automation to Kubernetes networking. It addresses
  the massive operational burden on teams by allowing them to interrogate complex
  network data and configurations using simple, natural language. It empowers teams
  to troubleshoot faster, detect anomalies, and optimize configurations using natural
  language prompts. Together, Calico AI and Istio Ambient Mode will help Kubernetes
  teams streamline operations, unify their toolchains, and manage complex Kubernetes
  environments with greater efficiency and confidence.'
