  Management IDC Spotlight: Overcoming Kubernetes Complexity with Modern Private Cloud
  Today, technology modernization isn’t a choice—it’s a necessity. IT leaders seeking
  a competitive edge are prioritizing a modern, resilient infrastructure that can
  support advanced applications and drive innovation. This new focus is squarely on
  cloud-native ecosystems, with both containers and virtual machines (VMs) seen as
  core elements of an enterprise modernization strategy. The challenge, as always,
  lies in managing increasing complexity. Organizations are running more container
  and VM management solutions than ever before, often facing issues with siloed infrastructure
  and operational inefficiencies. Broadcom recently commissioned a Forrester Opportunity
  Snapshot – “ Modernize Or Fall Behind: Rethinking IT Infrastructure For A Competitive
  Edge ” — that surveyed 216 IT decision-makers from the US, EMEA, and APAC with influence
  over their organization’s IT infrastructure strategy and architecture. 84% reported
  they were struggling to oversee the different tools and platforms used to manage
  their server virtualization and container management solutions. The demand for a
  simpler approach is clear: 85% of respondents want a single, unified platform to
  manage both containers and VMs. This unified approach promises significant benefits
  beyond simplified management. More than 80% of IT decision makers expect a single
  platform to increase scalability, streamline infrastructure management, and enhance
  resource utilization. But this isn’t just about central IT; a unified platform also
  accelerates DevOps processes and boosts application team agility. Read the report
  to learn how your peers are thinking about how to address the challenges of deploying
  and managing both containers and VMs, and how a single, unified platform such as
  VMware Cloud Foundation can help.'
