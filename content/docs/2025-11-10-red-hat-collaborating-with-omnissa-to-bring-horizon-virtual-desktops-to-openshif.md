  Infrastructure Applications Virtualization Share Choice and flexibility are essential
  in today''s IT environments. That''s why Omnissa is collaborating with Red Hat to
  enable organizations to deploy virtual desktops and applications using Omnissa Horizon
  on Red Hat OpenShift Virtualization. In the coming months, this collaboration will
  provide organizations with a modern, Kubernetes-native option for deploying and
  managing virtual machine-based (VM-based) virtual desktops and published applications
  alongside modern container-based applications, without having to maintain separate
  virtualization silos. Organizations continue to rely on virtual machine VM-based
  applications for critical workloads, even as they accelerate their shift to containers
  and Kubernetes. Maintaining separate virtualization and container platforms can
  lead to unnecessary silos, duplicate processes, and higher costs. By enabling Omnissa
  Horizon on Red Hat OpenShift Virtualization, customers will be able to: Run Horizon-based
  virtual desktops and apps on OpenShift Virtualization Simplify monitoring and operations
  with a unified platform for policies, automation, and governance Modernize workloads
  at the desired pace , supporting current VM workloads while introducing new cloud-native
  applications, including AI Omnissa is a digital work platform leader, trusted by
  thousands of organizations worldwide. Omnissa’s integrated platform and solutions
  deliver exceptional employee experiences that optimize security, IT operations,
  and cost. Omnissa Horizon, formerly part of VMware’s End-User Computing business,
  is an industry-leading platform for delivering secure, scalable virtual desktops
  and applications across hybrid and multi-cloud environments. Horizon includes capabilities
  such as on-demand application delivery and management via Omnissa App Volumes ,
  Omnissa Dynamic Environment Manager , and secure access gateway using Omnissa Unified
  Access Gateway. Red Hat OpenShift Virtualization, built on the mature and widely
  used KVM (Kernel-based Virtual Machine) hypervisor, extends Red Hat OpenShift to
  run VMs alongside containers. IT teams can manage both types of workloads with a
  consistent set of management tools and processes, automation, and security policies.
  By combining Red Hat’s hybrid cloud expertise with Omnissa’s digital workspace capabilities,
  organizations will be able to gain: Simplified VDI and modern application deployment
  : With Horizon''s VM-based infrastructure, customers can more easily deploy virtual
  desktops alongside their containerized application workloads using OpenShift Virtualization.'
