  (telco) industry stands at the precipice of a new era. With 5G networks rapidly
  expanding, service providers face both immense opportunities and significant challenges.
  The promise of 5G for ultra-fast speeds, low latency, and massive connectivity hinges
  on the ability to operationalize these complex networks with unprecedented efficiency
  and rigorous security measures. Automation is not just a buzzword in this landscape;
  it’s how to unlock the full value of 5G. Traditional manual processes simply cannot
  keep pace with the dynamic demands of modern networks. As network functions become
  increasingly containerized and cloud-native, the need for agile, consistent, and
  secure operations across hybrid and multicloud environments increases exponentially.
  Service providers want to invest in innovation to efficiently grow revenue, and
  automation is key to lowering costs and accelerating time to value on the journey
  to autonomous networks. Data and AI also deliver value across business and network
  aspects of telcos to mitigate risk, lower operational costs, and optimize resources.
  One New Zealand and Red Hat recently hosted a webinar featuring Sam Sun, Account
  Solution Architect at Red Hat, and Art Sripukdee, Principal Architect from One New
  Zealand. They shared a compelling story of how One New Zealand transformed its 5G
  vision into reality, achieving economies of scale, efficiency, and building a network
  designed for growth. One New Zealand, a leading telco provider, has consistently
  been at the forefront of mobile technology, from 2G to 5G, and recently launched
  text messaging over satellite. Their 5G rollout is not merely about new radio sites;
  it’s completely transforming network architecture.'
