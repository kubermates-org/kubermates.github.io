summary: 'Today, the ingress-nginx maintainers have released patches for a batch of
  critical vulnerabilities that could make it easy for attackers to take over your
  Kubernetes cluster: ingress-nginx v1. 12. 1 and ingress-nginx v1. 11. 5. If you
  are among the over 40% of Kubernetes administrators using ingress-nginx , you should
  take action immediately to protect your users and data. Ingress is the traditional
  Kubernetes feature for exposing your workload Pods to the world so that they can
  be useful. In an implementation-agnostic way, Kubernetes users can define how their
  applications should be made available on the network. Then, an ingress controller
  uses that definition to set up local or cloud resources as required for the user’s
  particular situation and needs. Many different ingress controllers are available,
  to suit users of different cloud providers or brands of load balancers. Ingress-nginx
  is a software-only ingress controller provided by the Kubernetes project. Because
  of its versatility and ease of use, ingress-nginx is quite popular: it is deployed
  in over 40% of Kubernetes clusters! Ingress-nginx translates the requirements from
  Ingress objects into configuration for nginx, a powerful open source webserver daemon.'
