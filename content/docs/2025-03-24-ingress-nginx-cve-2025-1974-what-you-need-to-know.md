summary: 'Ingress-nginx CVE-2025-1974: What You Need to Know Background Vulnerabilities
  Patched Today Your next steps Conclusion, thanks, and further reading Today, the
  ingress-nginx maintainers have released patches for a batch of critical vulnerabilities
  that could make it easy for attackers to take over your Kubernetes cluster: ingress-nginx
  v1.12.1 and ingress-nginx v1.11.5. If you are among the over 40% of Kubernetes administrators
  using ingress-nginx , you should take action immediately to protect your users and
  data. Ingress is the traditional Kubernetes feature for exposing your workload Pods
  to the world so that they can be useful. In an implementation-agnostic way, Kubernetes
  users can define how their applications should be made available on the network.
  Then, an ingress controller uses that definition to set up local or cloud resources
  as required for the user’s particular situation and needs. Many different ingress
  controllers are available, to suit users of different cloud providers or brands
  of load balancers. Ingress-nginx is a software-only ingress controller provided
  by the Kubernetes project. Because of its versatility and ease of use, ingress-nginx
  is quite popular: it is deployed in over 40% of Kubernetes clusters! Ingress-nginx
  translates the requirements from Ingress objects into configuration for nginx, a
  powerful open source webserver daemon. Then, nginx uses that configuration to accept
  and route requests to the various applications running within a Kubernetes cluster.
  Proper handling of these nginx configuration parameters is crucial, because ingress-nginx
  needs to allow users significant flexibility while preventing them from accidentally
  or intentionally tricking nginx into doing things it shouldn’t. Four of today’s
  ingress-nginx vulnerabilities are improvements to how ingress-nginx handles particular
  bits of nginx config. Without these fixes, a specially-crafted Ingress object can
  cause nginx to misbehave in various ways, including revealing the values of Secrets
  that are accessible to ingress-nginx.'
