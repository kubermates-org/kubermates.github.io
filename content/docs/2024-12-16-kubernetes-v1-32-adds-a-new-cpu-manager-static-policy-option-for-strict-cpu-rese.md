tldr: In Kubernetes v1.
summary: In Kubernetes v1. 32, after years of community discussion, we are excited
  to introduce a strict-cpu-reservation option for the CPU Manager static policy.
  This feature is currently in alpha, with the associated policy hidden by default.
  You can only use the policy if you explicitly enable the alpha behavior in your
  cluster. The CPU Manager static policy is used to reduce latency or improve performance.
  The reservedSystemCPUs defines an explicit CPU set for OS system daemons and kubernetes
  system daemons.
