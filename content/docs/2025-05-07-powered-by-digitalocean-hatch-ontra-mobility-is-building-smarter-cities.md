  \ 4 min read Hatch is DigitalOceanâ\x80\x99s global program for startups, which\
  \ provides selected growing technology companies with credits and discounts on computing\
  \ resources so they can build and scale with less worry about costs. By keeping\
  \ infrastructure and cost management simple, the Hatch program helps enable startups\
  \ to build solutions that move society forward. Ontra Mobility , a Y Combinator\
  \ startup, transforms communities by developing data-driven tools that help cities\
  \ and transit agencies plan and operate more efficient, equitable, and sustainable\
  \ transportation systems, focusing on optimizing networks and improving first-and-last\
  \ mile access through on-demand ridesharing. We sat down with CTO Connor Riley,\
  \ who chose DigitalOcean for its simple, managed infrastructure so they can focus\
  \ on making public transit more accessible. The Hatch program provided credits and\
  \ resources that helped support their mission. During their PhD programs at Georgia\
  \ Institute of Technology, Riley and his co-founder Anthony Trasatti worked with\
  \ their academic advisor, Pascal Van Hentenryck, to optimize public transit, which\
  \ serves as a vital lifeline for many. Working closely with MARTA in Atlanta, GA,\
  \ they developed techniques for network design optimization, special events scheduling,\
  \ and dispatching algorithms for on-demand ridesharing. These projects powered on-demand\
  \ ridesharing pilots MARTA Reach and CAT SMART in Savannah, Georgia. Getting adoption\
  \ for a product that serves public agencies is as much of a battle as building the\
  \ product itself. Since many residents rely on public transportation, establishing\
  \ trust with transit agencies is essential before theyâ\x80\x99ll risk adopting\
  \ new products that could impact municipal residents. Despite these hurdles, theyâ\x80\
  \x99re undeterred: theyâ\x80\x99ve already gained traction with a number of customers,\
  \ including conducting a microtransit planning project in Washington D. C."
