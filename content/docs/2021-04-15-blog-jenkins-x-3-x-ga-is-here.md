  : Here’s a demo of how to develop code with Jenkins X the main documentation of
  the changes are: here’s a brief summary of the differences: The following improvements
  have been made since the first beta : As a user the high level UX of Jenkins X is
  similar: We have been using Jenkins X 3. x in production now for many months (for
  CI/CD of all of the 3. x codebase and continuously upgrading our cluster in the
  standard way and it’s been much simpler and easier to use, operate and configure.
  We have also been continuously delivering changes from Jenkins X into our production
  cluster for many months now and it’s been working great - GitOps FTW! In general
  Jenkins X 3. x is now much simpler and more flexible. It supports lots more platforms
  than before and should be easy to extend and configure for other platforms too.
  If you have never tried 3. x before then please follow the Admin Guide to get Jenkins
  X installed on your cloud provider, on-premises kubernetes cluster or minikube.
  If you previously tried the 3. x alpha then the migration instructions are here.
  For folks on older 2.'
