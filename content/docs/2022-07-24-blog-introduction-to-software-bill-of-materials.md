tldr: Before going through Software Bill Of Materials (SBOMs), we need to set the
  ground for a rising concern in the software industry which is Software Supply Chain
  Security. Like traditional industries, deploying a piece of a software artifact
  goes through multiple stages composed of collecting source code components, libraries,
  tools, and processes used in those stages.
summary: Before going through Software Bill Of Materials (SBOMs), we need to set the
  ground for a rising concern in the software industry which is Software Supply Chain
  Security. Like traditional industries, deploying a piece of a software artifact
  goes through multiple stages composed of collecting source code components, libraries,
  tools, and processes used in those stages. Fig. 1 https://blog. convisoappsec. com/en/is-your-software-supply-chain-secure/
  A supply chain attack can occur along the chain from submitting unauthorized malicious
  code in your source, unauthorized injection of harmful dependencies, and even replacing
  packages after being built with other compromised artifacts. A more detailed explanation
  about those types of attacks is here Due to its importance and being a critical
  issue, generating SBOM for your software adds another layer of protection to this
  threat. As far as we know, developers around the world are building web applications
  using hundreds of third-party open-source libraries and packages. You can confidently
  tell that 90% of the software products around the world are built over open-source
  components. With that in mind, we need to keep track of using these dependencies
  while building our applications. What if there are vulnerabilities in the libraries
  we use? How to efficiently protect ourselves against it?. Software Bill Of Materials
  (SBOM) is a complete formally structured list of the materials (components, packages,
  libraries, SDK) used to build (i.
