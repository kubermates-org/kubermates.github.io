  via the VCF Installer’s guided steps, allowing teams to quickly deploy a “Fleet”—a

  efficiency with management tools that simplify patching and upgrades, while seamlessly
  integrating containers and services. It also utilizes consolidated logs to help
  pinpoint issues faster. Public Cloud Experience: Enables customers to access resources
  via GUI or API, ensuring full lifecycle governance from Day 0 deployment through
  daily operations. Learn more about VCF Operations here. About the VCF Breakroom
