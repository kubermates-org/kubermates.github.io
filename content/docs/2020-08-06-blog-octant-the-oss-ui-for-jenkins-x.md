summary: 'A common question we have heard in the community over the years is Is there
  an open source UI for Jenkins X?. Well we now have an answer: its Octant using the
  octant-jx plugin. We love Octant because: Longer term we’re planning on making most
  of the developer and operations features of Jenkins X available through the UI via
  octant-jx. e. g. we hope as part of Jenkins X 3. x you’ll be able to install or
  upgrade Jenkins X and watch the installation proceed all via Octant. But already
  right now today you can: Find out more about installing and using Octant here. We
  did a demo of octant-jx at the last office hours. We also presented octant-jx at
  the octant office hours this week. Here is a demo video showing octant in action
  with Jenkins X :.'
