summary: 'Octant: the OSS UI for Jenkins X Why Octant? Features Demo A common question
  we have heard in the community over the years is Is there an open source UI for
  Jenkins X?. Well we now have an answer: its Octant using the octant-jx plugin. We
  love Octant because: open source and very easy to extend with plugins in Go or TypeScript/JavaScript
  lets you visualise and work with all kubernetes and custom resources across multiple
  clusters thanks to octant-jx has awesome integration with Jenkins X components like
  apps, environments, pipelines, repositories etc. Longer term we’re planning on making
  most of the developer and operations features of Jenkins X available through the
  UI via octant-jx. e. g. we hope as part of Jenkins X 3. x you’ll be able to install
  or upgrade Jenkins X and watch the installation proceed all via Octant. But already
  right now today you can: view applications, environments, pipelines, repositories
  for a pipeline quickly navigate to: its Pod, Log, Pull Request or Preview Environment
  for each step you can view the step detail or log of the step its Pod, Log, Pull
  Request or Preview Environment for each step you can view the step detail or log
  of the step see the various jobs and pipelines used to operate Jenkins X itself
  over time will add management UI capabilities for installing, upgrading and administering
  Jenkins Find out more about installing and using Octant here. We did a demo of octant-jx
  at the last office hours. We also presented octant-jx at the octant office hours
  this week. Here is a demo video showing octant in action with Jenkins X : ← Previous.'
