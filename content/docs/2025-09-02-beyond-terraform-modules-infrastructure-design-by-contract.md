  projects highlighted in this post It’s 2AM. You’re staring at a failed deployment
  pipeline, trying to figure out why your EKS cluster can’t find the right subnets.
  You’ve checked the variables, verified the outputs, and triple-checked your depends_on
  statements. Everything looks correct, yet it still fails. This scenario plays out
  daily across organizations that have adopted Terraform. While modules promised composable,
  reusable infrastructure, the reality has become a complex web of string-matching,
  implicit dependencies, and tribal knowledge. How much of your team’s time is spent
  debugging module connections rather than delivering value? Every time a team provisions
  infrastructure for a new service or application, they pay an invisible tax in cognitive
  overhead: For each input a module needs, someone must make critical decisions: Is
  this value a hard-coded constant? A data lookup? An output from another module?
  The answer differs for every project and environment, so this decision tree must
  be rebuilt from scratch each time.'
