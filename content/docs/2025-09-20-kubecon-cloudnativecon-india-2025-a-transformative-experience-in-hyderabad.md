  the KCD Organizer digest, and special thanks to Kemila De Silva for nominating me.
  This opportunity opened doors to an unforgettable learning and networking experience
  that will shape my cloud-native journey for years to come. Reuniting with Fellow
  Sri Lankan Cloud Native Leaders One of the most exciting aspects of this trip was
  meeting my fellow KCD organizers and CNCF ambassadors Kemila De Silva and Chamod
  Shehanka Perera. These amazing individuals traveled to Hyderabad to speak on the
  first day of KubeCon, representing the vibrant Sri Lankan cloud-native community
  on an international stage. Day 1: Keynotes, Connections, and Big Announcements Our
  first day began with the essential conference ritual of collecting our badges and
  heading to the keynote hall. The energy was palpable, with thousands of cloud-native
  enthusiasts gathered under one roof. A Brief but Memorable Encounter After the keynotes,
  we had the privilege of meeting Chris, the CTO of Cloud Infrastructure at CNCF.
  Despite his hectic schedule, he graciously took a minute to speak with us, a testament
  to the inclusive, welcoming nature of the CNCF community. Exciting News: KubeCon
  2026 Mumbai During the initial keynotes, we received thrilling news: KubeCon 2026
  is coming to Mumbai in July! This announcement was met with thunderous applause
  and signals the growing importance of India in the global cloud native ecosystem.
  Solution Showcase: Unexpected Sri Lankan Connections The Solution Showcase proved
  to be a treasure trove of discoveries. We were delighted to meet two fellow Sri
  Lankans making their mark in the cloud-native world: Exploring Cutting-Edge Observability
  The showcase floor buzzed with innovative technologies.'
