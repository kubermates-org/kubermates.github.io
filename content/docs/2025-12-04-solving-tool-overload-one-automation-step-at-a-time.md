  hybrid cloud Security Edge computing Infrastructure Applications Virtualization
  Share Modern IT departments are wrestling with a sprawling array of automation and
  operations tools, often numbering in the dozens or even hundreds. This complexity
  makes efficient management and integration a significant obstacle, especially as
  organizations accelerate their investment in hybrid IT ecosystems, cloud services,
  and cloud-native application modernization. To help overcome this "tool sprawl"
  and its impact on productivity, enterprises are working to establish a common environment
  for orchestrating and managing critical IT processes—a "unified IT automation platform.
  " To understand the business imperatives driving this shift, we asked S&P Global
  Market Intelligence 451 Research to conduct a comprehensive survey with 900 business
  and IT decision-makers and influencers. These leaders provided their perspectives
  on the current state of IT automation, anticipated changes, and the implications
  of relying on so many different tools. These insights also helped shape our understanding
  of the definition and expectations for a unified IT automation platform. Automation
  challenges: The journey to stable and reliable IT automation isn''t without its
  challenges. The top hurdles identified by respondents were complex and lengthy implementation
  processes , cited by a substantial 58%, closely followed by integration with existing
  systems and software, at 51%. Budget constraints (44%) and skills shortages (40%)
  also pose obstacles. Excess IT tooling: The pervasive challenge of tool sprawl is
  evident, with 42% of respondents reporting the use of 26-50 different tools, with
  28% reporting more than 50 tools in their toolbox. This fragmentation underscores
  the need for enhanced tool interoperability. Encouragingly, a significant two-thirds
  (69%) of enterprises have already established platform engineering programs or are
  actively committing resources to integrate these tools through a unified orchestration
  layer.'
