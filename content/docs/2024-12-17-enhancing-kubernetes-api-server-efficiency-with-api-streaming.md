  is growing.
summary: Managing Kubernetes clusters efficiently is critical, especially as their
  size is growing. A significant challenge with large clusters is the memory overhead
  caused by list requests. In the existing implementation, the kube-apiserver processes
  list requests by assembling the entire response in-memory before transmitting any
  data to the client. But what if the response body is substantial, say hundreds of
  megabytes? Additionally, imagine a scenario where multiple list requests flood in
  simultaneously, perhaps after a brief network outage. While API Priority and Fairness
  has proven to reasonably protect kube-apiserver from CPU overload, its impact is
  visibly smaller for memory protection. T...
