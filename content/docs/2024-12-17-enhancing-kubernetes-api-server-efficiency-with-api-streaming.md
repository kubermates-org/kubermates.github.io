  Managing Kubernetes clusters efficiently is critical, especially as their size is
  growing. A significant challenge with large clusters is the memory overhead caused
  by list requests. In the existing implementation, the kube-apiserver processes list
  requests by assembling the entire response in-memory before transmitting any data
  to the client. But what if the response body is substantial, say hundreds of megabytes?
  Additionally, imagine a scenario where multiple list requests flood in simultaneously,
  perhaps after a brief network outage. While API Priority and Fairness has proven
  to reasonably protect kube-apiserver from CPU overload, its impact is visibly smaller
  for memory protection. This can be explained by the differing nature of resource
  consumption by a single API request - the CPU usage at any given time is capped
  by a constant, whereas memory, being uncompressible, can grow proportionally with
  the number of processed objects and is unbounded. This situation poses a genuine
  risk, potentially overwhelming and crashing any kube-apiserver within seconds due
  to out-of-memory (OOM) conditions. To better visualize the issue, let's consider
  the below graph. The graph shows the memory usage of a kube-apiserver during a synthetic
  test. (see the synthetic test section for more details). The results clearly show
  that increasing the number of informers significantly boosts the server's memory
  consumption.
