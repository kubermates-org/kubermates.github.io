  Fast forward 100 days, and today we’re celebrating a major milestone: 100 days of
  the kagent project ! 🎉Thank you everyone for being part of this journey! 🚀 What
  began as a tool to address our own customer challenges has grown into a thriving
  open-source project. Kagent is now a CNCF Sandbox project , and it’s evolving into
  a powerful declarative agentic AI framework —enabling like-minded engineers to run
  AI agents in Kubernetes, automating complex operations and streamlining troubleshooting
  workflows. Source: LinkedIn post In just 100 days, kagent has hit two incredible
  milestones: 🚀 100 contributors , with over 85% from outside Solo. io ⭐ 1000+ GitHub
  stars from our amazing community! We’ve been actively connecting with contributors
  through GitHub, Discord, weekly community calls, livestreams, and Contributor Spotlights.
  We’re incredibly grateful for everyone who’s explored, supported, and contributed
  to kagent. A huge shoutout to our top 20 contributors , and a special thanks to
  our top 3 : @eitanya, @peterj, and @sbx03 — we deeply appreciate your dedication
  and impact!! 🙌 Source: https://kagent. devstats. cncf. io/d/66/developer-activity-counts-by-companies?orgId=1
  Over the past 100 days, we’ve been blown away by how our early adopters are using
  kagent in creative and powerful ways—including in production environments ! Across
  social media, community meetings , and beyond, users are not just experimenting—they’re
  innovating. 💡 Here are just a few examples of how the community is putting kagent
