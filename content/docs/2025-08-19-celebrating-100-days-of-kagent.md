  had a bold vision: to bring agentic AI to cloud native—empowering platforms and
  DevOps engineers to harness AI agents for solving real operational challenges. Fast
  forward 100 days, and today we’re celebrating a major milestone: 100 days of the
  kagent project ! 🎉Thank you everyone for being part of this journey! 🚀 What began
  as a tool to address our own customer challenges has grown into a thriving open-source
  project. Kagent is now a CNCF Sandbox project , and it’s evolving into a powerful
  declarative agentic AI framework —enabling like-minded engineers to run AI agents
  in Kubernetes, automating complex operations and streamlining troubleshooting workflows.

  🚀 100 contributors , with over 85% from outside Solo. io ⭐ 1000+ GitHub stars from
  our amazing community! We’ve been actively connecting with contributors through
  GitHub, Discord, weekly community calls, livestreams, and Contributor Spotlights.
  We’re incredibly grateful for everyone who’s explored, supported, and contributed
  to kagent. A huge shoutout to our top 20 contributors , and a special thanks to
  our top 3 : @eitanya, @peterj, and @sbx03 — we deeply appreciate your dedication
  and impact!! 🙌 Source: https://kagent. devstats. cncf. io/d/66/developer-activity-counts-by-companies?orgId=1
  Over the past 100 days, we’ve been blown away by how our early adopters are using
  kagent in creative and powerful ways—including in production environments ! Across
  social media, community meetings , and beyond, users are not just experimenting—they’re
  innovating. 💡 Here are just a few examples of how the community is putting kagent
  to work: Source: Linkedin post Source: Linkedin post Source: LinkedIn post Source:
