  Applications Virtualization Share Today, the Fedora Project is excited to announce
  that the beta version of Fedora Linux 43 - the latest version of the free and open
  source operating system - is now available. Learn more about the new and updated
  features of Fedora 43 Beta below and don’t forget to make sure that your system
  is fully up-to-date before upgrading from a previous release. Anaconda WebUI for
  Fedora Spins by default: Creates a more consistent and modern installation experience
  across all Fedora desktop variants, and brings us closer to eventually replacing
  the older GTK installer, allowing all Fedora users to benefit from the same polished
  and user-friendly interface. Switch Anaconda installer to DNF5: Provides better
  support and debugging for package-based applications within Anaconda, and is a bigger
  step towards the eventual deprecation or removal of DNF4, which is now in maintenance
  mode. Enable auto-updates by default in Fedora Kinoite: Assures users are more consistently
  running a system with the latest bug fixes and features after a simple reboot, with
  updates applied automatically in the background. Set default monospace fallback
  font: Establishes a standard fallback font when a specified monospace font is missing.
  The font selection also remains more stable and predictable, even when the user
  installs new font packages, and no jarring font changes that were in previous versions.
  GNU toolchain update: Allows Fedora to stay current with the latest features, improvements,
  and bug and security fixes from the upstream gcc, glibc, binutils, and gdb projects,
  and delivers a working system compiler, assembler, static and dynamic linker, core
  language runtimes, and debugger. Package-specific RPM macros for build flags: Provides
  a standard way for packages to add to the default list of compiler flags. It also
  offers a cleaner and simpler method for package maintainers to make per-package
  adjustments to build flags, avoiding the need to manually edit and re-export environmental
  variables, and prevents potential issues that could arise from the old manual method,
  confirming that flag adjustments are applied appropriately. Build Fedora CoreOS
  using Containerfile: This change brings the Fedora CoreOS (FCOS) build process under
  a standard container image build, moving away from the custom tool, CoreOS Assembler.
  It also means that anyone with Podman installed can build FCOS, which simplifies
  the process for both individual users and automated pipelines.'
