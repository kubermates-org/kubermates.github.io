summary: This announcement originally appeared on the etcd blog. Today, we are releasing
  etcd v3. 6. 0 , the first minor release since etcd v3. 5. 0 on June 15, 2021. This
  release introduces several new features, makes significant progress on long-standing
  efforts like downgrade support and migration to v3store, and addresses numerous
  critical & major issues. It also includes major optimizations in memory usage, improving
  efficiency and performance. In addition to the features of v3. 6. 0, etcd has joined
  Kubernetes as a SIG (sig-etcd), enabling us to improve project sustainability. We've
  introduced systematic robustness testing to ensure correctness and reliability.
