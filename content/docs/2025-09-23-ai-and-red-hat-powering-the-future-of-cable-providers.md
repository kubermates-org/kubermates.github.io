  Share North American cable providers are in the middle of a massive shift. It''s
  no longer just about delivering TV; it''s about being the backbone of high-speed
  internet, advanced communication, and a whole suite of digital services. To thrive
  in this evolving landscape, our partners in the cable industry are strategically
  leaning into Artificial Intelligence (AI). This is precisely where Red Hat''s AI
  technologies come in, offering a comprehensive framework to not only modernize existing
  infrastructure but also to unlock new revenue streams and significantly enhance
  operational efficiency and security. The core strategy for North American cable
  providers revolves around building highly agile, intelligent networks. Red Hat is
  a critical enabler of this strategy by helping transition to Software-Defined Networks
  (SDN) and edge computing architectures. These aren''t just buzzwords; they''re the
  foundation for open, flexible platforms that integrate AI smoothly. For providers,
  this means: Faster service deployment : Launching new services and features quickly
  to stay ahead of the competition and meet consumer demands. Enhanced network intelligence
  : Using AI to understand network behavior, predict issues, and optimize performance
  proactively. Virtualization is another key strategic pillar. Red Hat facilitates
  the deployment of virtualized cable modem termination systems (vCMTS) on our cloud-native
  platform built on Red Hat OpenShift. This directly addresses the need for: Scalability
  : Meeting the ever-increasing demands for bandwidth and new services without massive
  hardware overhauls.'
