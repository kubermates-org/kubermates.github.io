  Virtualization Share Red Hat helps organizations embrace AI innovation by providing
  a comprehensive and layered approach to security and safety across the entire AI
  lifecycle. We use our trusted foundation and expertise in open hybrid cloud to address
  the challenges around AI security, helping our customers build and deploy AI applications
  with more trust. As organizations adopt AI , they encounter significant security
  and safety hurdles. These advanced workloads need robust infrastructure and scalable
  resources and a comprehensive security posture that extends across the AI lifecycle.
  Many AI projects struggle to reach production because of these significant safety
  and security concerns. Some of the challenges organizations face include: Evolving
  AI-specific threats: AI applications and models are becoming attractive targets
  for malicious actors. Beyond conventional software vulnerabilities, critical concerns
  include training data poisoning, model evasion or theft, and adversarial attacks.
  Complex software supply chain: The AI lifecycle involves numerous components, increasing
  vulnerability risks. AI applications also often depend on a vast ecosystem of open
  source libraries, pre-trained models, and complicated data pipelines. A single vulnerability
  or malicious component introduced at any stage—from data ingestion and third-party
  libraries to the base container images—can compromise the integrity and security
  of the entire AI system. Recent supply chain attacks highlight the urgent industry
  need for verifiable integrity and provenance for all software artifacts, including
  AI models and their dependencies. Critical AI safety requirements: Trust is built
  on the assurance that AI models will operate as intended and without bias.'
