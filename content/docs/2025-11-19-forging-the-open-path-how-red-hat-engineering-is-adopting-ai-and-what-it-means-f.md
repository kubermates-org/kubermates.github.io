  Infrastructure Applications Virtualization Share Over the past several months, Red
  Hat has been diving into one of the most significant shifts in our industry: the
  practical, large-scale adoption of generative AI (gen AI) within a major engineering
  organization. We are not unique in this journey, but at Red Hat, "in the open" isn''t
  just a development model—it''s our culture. We believe it''s important to share
  what we''re doing, what we''re learning, and how we see this shaping the future
  of open source collaboration. To be clear, this isn''t a publicity piece about a
  single, perfect tool or an instant success. It''s a story about culture, choice,
  and how AI—when grounded in solid engineering principles—becomes a powerful accelerator
  for open source innovation. It''s impossible to ignore AI’s hype, but what’s obscured
  by all that buzz is a fundamental truth—AI is a new layer of the technology stack.
  It''s a capability multiplier, much like compilers, the IDE, and the cloud were
  before it. For Red Hat, our "why" is twofold: Internal acceleration : We have thousands
  of engineers working on millions of lines of code across thousands of upstream projects.
  The potential for our engineers to augment their work with AI to reduce toil, accelerate
  problem-solving, and automate mundane tasks is massive. We owe it to our engineers
  to provide them with the best tools to do their best work. The open source future
  : More importantly, Red Hat’s mission is to be the defining technology company of
  the 21st century, and we believe open source is the best way to build technology.
  If AI remains a proprietary "black box" world, it runs counter to everything we
  stand for.'
