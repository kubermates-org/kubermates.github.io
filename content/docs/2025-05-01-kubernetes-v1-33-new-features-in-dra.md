summary: 'Kubernetes v1. 33: New features in DRA Features promoted to beta New alpha
  features Preparing for general availability What’s next? Getting involved Acknowledgments
  Kubernetes Dynamic Resource Allocation (DRA) was originally introduced as an alpha
  feature in the v1. 26 release, and then went through a significant redesign for
  Kubernetes v1. 31. The main DRA feature went to beta in v1. 32, and the project
  hopes it will be generally available in Kubernetes v1. 34. The basic feature set
  of DRA provides a far more powerful and flexible API for requesting devices than
  Device Plugin. And while DRA remains a beta feature for v1. 33, the DRA team has
  been hard at work implementing a number of new features and UX improvements. One
  feature has been promoted to beta, while a number of new features have been added
  in alpha. The team has also made progress towards getting DRA ready for GA.'
