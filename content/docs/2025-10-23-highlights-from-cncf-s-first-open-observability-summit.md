  about time open observability had its own industry-wide, vendor-neutral event. This
  year, the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) finally made it happen with the
  inaugural Open Observability Summit , bringing together contributors, practitioners,
  and end users for a packed day of learning and collaboration. I was honored to deliver
  a keynote at this important event, as well as have my podcast OpenObservability
  Talks as a partner of the event. I dedicated my latest episode to covering the highlights
  from the event, and invited two fellow observability veterans and speakers of the
  event — Alok Bhide , member of the summit’s content committee and Head of Product
  Innovation at Chronosphere, and Henrik Rexed , Developer Advocate at Dynatrace,
  CNCF Ambassador, and host of the Is It Observable podcast. Together, we unpacked
  the summit highlights. Here’s a recap, and you can find the full recording on all
  the podcast apps, with links bellow. Where’s the community’s meeting point to discuss
  open source observability? There are quite a few conferences out there on observability,
  but they are largely owned by vendors in this space. And with Monitorma currently
  on pause, it leaves us with no good place to come together. The CNCF has done great
  job in bringing everyone together, dovetailing Open Source Summit North America.
  Alok, who’s been on the program committeee and got to review and select the talks
  on the Call For Papers, shared on the balance of the talks and breadth of the projects
  covered: “combination of foundational talks and the shining new things… and across
  the different projects: OTel, FluentBit, Jaeger, Prometheus, everything. ” This
  resulted in some great talks, which are already available online on the CNCF’s YouTube
  channel.'
