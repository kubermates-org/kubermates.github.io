summary: As the release of Kubernetes v1. 33 approaches, the Kubernetes project continues
  to evolve. Features may be deprecated, removed, or replaced to improve the overall
  health of the project. This blog post outlines some planned changes for the v1.
  33 release, which the release team believes you should be aware of to ensure the
  continued smooth operation of your Kubernetes environment and to keep you up-to-date
  with the latest developments. The information below is based on the current status
  of the v1. 33 release and is subject to change before the final release date. The
  Kubernetes project has a well-documented deprecation policy for features. This policy
  states that stable APIs may only be deprecated when a newer, stable version of that
  same API is available and that APIs have a minimum lifetime for each stability level.
  A deprecated API has been marked for removal in a future Kubernetes release. It
  will continue to function until removal (at least one year from the deprecation),
  but usage will result in a warning being displayed. Removed APIs are no longer available
  in the current version, at which point you must migrate to using the replacement.
