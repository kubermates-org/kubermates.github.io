summary: 'What are Kubernetes Operators? Difference between traditional Kubernetes
  Controllers and Operators How Kubernetes Operators work 1. Set up a Custom Resource
  2. Deploy the Operator into the Kubernetes cluster 3. Continuous monitoring of CR
  by the Operator. 4. Reconciliation loop: Operator compares desired vs actual state
  5. Error handling Use cases of Kubernetes Operators Handling stateful apps Messaging
  systems Monitoring and logging stacks Automating infrastructure Why do we need Operators?
  Challenges without Operators Kubernetes Operators benefits Conclusion Posted on

  , covering Automating Stateful Apps with Kubernetes Operators. If you’ve ever had
  issues with scaling databases or automating upgrades in Kubernetes, Operators can
  help by saving you time and effort. Handling complex Kubernetes applications like
  databases, message queues, and distributed systems can be really difficult. Kubernetes
  handles simple workloads well, while big apps suffer with failover, scaling, backups,
  and automated updates. These activities often demand operational expertise. If you’re
  new to container orchestration, you may want to start by understanding the difference
  between Kubernetes vs Docker This is where you need Kubernetes Operators, which
  we’ll cover in this article.'
