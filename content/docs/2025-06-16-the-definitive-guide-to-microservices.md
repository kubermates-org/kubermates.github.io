summary: Microservices are a way to design applications as a collection of small,
  independent services, each focusing on specific business functions. They ensure
  scalability, flexibility, and ease of maintenance by allowing individual services
  to operate and be updated autonomously. In this guide, we will break down what microservices
  are, how they operate, their advantages, key components, and best practices, offering
  a comprehensive overview for anyone looking to understand this modern architectural
  approach. Microservices are an architectural style that organizes an application
  as a collection of small, independently deployable services. Unlike traditional
  monolithic architectures, where a single service encapsulates all functionalities,
  microservices based applications break down applications into individual services,
  each focusing on a specific business capability. This modularity allows for independent
  deployment and scaling, making microservice architecture a popular choice for modern
  applications, particularly when considering internal microservices. One of the key
  characteristics of microservices is their cloud-native approach. Each service operates
  independently but is part of a larger application framework, often utilizing cloud
  resources to ensure scalability and fault tolerance. This approach not only enhances
  the flexibility of the system but also promotes the use of a diverse technology
  stack for different services, allowing teams to choose the best tools for each specific
  function, including individual microservices. Microservices are designed around
  bounded contexts, where a consistent domain model applies to a specific area of
  the application. This ensures that responsibilities are well defined, and each service
  can focus on a single function within the application. Small, cross-functional teams
  can manage and develop these services independently, fostering agility and rapid
  development cycles in a microservices architecture.
