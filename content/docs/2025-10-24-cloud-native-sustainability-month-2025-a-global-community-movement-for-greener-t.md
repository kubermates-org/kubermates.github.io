  Resilience Following the success of previous years, CNCF’s Sustainability Month
  is back — bigger and greener than ever. Organized by the TAG Operational Resilience
  community, this month-long global initiative brings together practitioners, developers,
  and advocates to explore sustainable cloud native practices and drive real change.
  After the big success from the last couple of years, with 20+ meetups around the
  world in 2024 and a global livestream, we’re back – now as CNCF Cloud Native Sustainability
  Month, extending beyond a week to allow more time for deeper global conversations
  on sustainability! The global event, supported by the CNCF Technical Advisory Group
  Operational Resilience, aims to bring together local communities to keep the discussion
  open regarding sustainable technology and a more sustainable cloud native future.
  Sustainability Month is your opportunity to: Dive into the latest sustainable cloud
  native technologies Connect with like-minded experts and peers who are driving environmental
  change in tech Learn practical and the newest strategies for reducing your cloud
  infrastructure’s carbon footprint Join the global conversation about building a
  greener, more responsible technology industry By attending or hosting a session,
  you can help drive the conversation forward, sharing ideas and best practices that
  will shape the future of sustainable cloud native infrastructure. Let’s work together
  to make a meaningful impact and create a greener, more responsible tech ecosystem!
  We need your energy and creativity to make this month a success! Whether you’re
  a local community organizer, a sustainability advocate, or someone simply curious
  about green tech, there’s a way to participate. When: November 2025 How: Add your

  is more than an event — it’s a global movement. By sharing local insights and collaborating
  across borders, we can make cloud native technology both innovative and environmentally
  responsible. Together, we can ensure that cloud innovation goes hand in hand with
  sustainability. Let’s make this year’s Sustainability Month the most impactful one
