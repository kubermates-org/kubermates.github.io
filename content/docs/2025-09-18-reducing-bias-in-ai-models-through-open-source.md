  Applications Virtualization Share An experience can plant a seed in your mind that
  grows into a much bigger idea. I recently visited Japan, a beautiful country with
  a rich and defined culture, and was reminded of how deeply language and culture
  are intertwined. Language structure reflects and also influences how people perceive
  the world. For example, some cultures are more informal, while others with established
  social hierarchies tend to be more formal. It’s manifested grammatically, and also
  in the way people greet each other, the way questions are formed, and the very rhythm
  of conversation. This experience sparked a question for me: as we build a new generation
  of AI, how do we train it to speak the language of all cultures? We often hear about
  AI as a revolutionary global tool, a technology for all of humanity. But if AI is
  learning from our collective data, whose culture is it truly learning? The promise
  of a universally intelligent system is powerful, but it masks a critical issue,
  in that today''s most powerful AI models are not culturally neutral. They are a
  direct reflection of their training data, which is overwhelmingly English-centric
  and Western-biased. The concept of "AI sovereignty" becomes particularly relevant
  to this Western-biased model training. It''s not simply about having access to technology
  or hardware, but also about building AI that can reflect a nation''s or community''s
  unique languages, values, and culture. We believe the key to achieving this lies
  in the world of open source AI. Digital sovereignty, particularly in the context
  of AI, is rapidly evolving from an abstract concept to a critical, real-world issue.'
