  We’ll walk through real scenarios showing how conversational AI turns multi-step
  manual tasks into simple natural language requests. Teams managing Kubernetes workloads
  require expertise across container orchestration, infrastructure, networking, and
  security. While Large Language Models (LLMs) help developers write code and manage
  workloads, they’re limited without real-time cluster access. Generic recommendations
  based on outdated training data don’t meet real-world needs. Model Context Protocol
  (MCP) solves this by giving AI models secure access to live cluster data. MCP is
  an open-source standard that lets AI models securely access external tools and data
  sources for better context. It provides a standardized interface that enriches AI
  applications with real-time, contextual knowledge of EKS clusters, enabling more
  accurate and tailored guidance throughout the application lifecycle, from development
  through operations. Earlier this year, AWS was one of the first managed Kubernetes
  service providers to announce an MCP server, within a few months of the release
  of MCP protocol. Customers could install this EKS MCP Server on their machines for
  EKS and Kubernetes resource management. This initial, locally installable version
  of EKS MCP Server enabled us to rapidly validate our approach and gather valuable
  customer feedback, which has directly shaped today’s announcement.'
