  Share This series takes a look at the people and planning that went into building
  and releasing Red Hat Enterprise Linux 10. From the earliest conceptual stages to
  the launch at Red Hat Summit 2025, we’ll hear firsthand accounts of how RHEL 10
  came into being. Part 1 | Part 2 | Part 3 In our previous installment of the story
  of how Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) 10 came to be, we got insights into the testing
  process and how the headline features (and the stories around those features) started
  coming together. In part 4, those stories come into clearer focus as the team works
  to put the finishing touches on various features before code freeze. Brian Stinson,
  principal software engineer "The last stretch of time: That part is actually where
  things get a little bit more intense for the individual teams because it’s not only
  ‘Are we buttoning up features?’ but ‘Were we able to cover the rest of the baseline
  enablement stuff we needed to do as part of the release?’ Are all my packages in?
  Did we get them QE’d on the right schedule? Have they gone out for feedback? Those
  types of activities actually ramp up quite a bit as we head toward code freeze.
  " Chris Wells, senior director, Product Marketing - RHEL Business Unit "I knew we
  needed to take this story and try and make it exciting. But we weren''t going to
  change what features were in this release, we could only change how we could talk
  about those features. So I had a meeting here in Columbus where I pulled in Marty
  Loveless, who was the lead product marketing manager on RHEL 10, and Scott McCarty,
  who lives just an hour or two up the road in Akron. He drove down for the day. We
  locked ourselves in a conference room, and we just brainstormed ‘what were the different
  angles we could talk about things in?’ Trying to look at something that was new
  and figure out: Was there a different angle?" Major Hayden, senior principal software
  engineer "It was another Red Hatter and I on the engineering side building the code,
  so he and I divided the work. RAG [retrieval augmented generation] was our number
  one challenge. We kind of assumed that it was: You throw a bunch of PDFs in a bucket,
  boom, let’s search.'
