tldr: Who will get the most out of attending this event? What is new and different
  this year? What will the day look like? Should I do any homework first? A special
  note from the program chairs Posted on October 13, 2025 by Yuzhui Liu, Rajas Kakodkar,
  Ricardo Rocha, Yuan Tang | Co-Chairs Cloud Native & Kubernetes AI Day is welcoming
  the AI/ML and High Performance Computing (HPC) communities. Since 2022 there have
  been multiple dedicated events (Batch / HPC and Cloud Native AI days) but given
  the overlap in requirements, projects and end user interests it became clear we
  all fit better together.

  Ricardo Rocha, Yuan Tang | Co-Chairs Cloud Native & Kubernetes AI Day is welcoming
  the AI/ML and High Performance Computing (HPC) communities. Since 2022 there have
  been multiple dedicated events (Batch / HPC and Cloud Native AI days) but given
  the overlap in requirements, projects and end user interests it became clear we
  all fit better together. Cloud Native & Kubernetes AI Day brings together a diverse
  range of technical enthusiasts, open source contributors, practitioners, researchers
  and end users. All united in a common goal: enhancing Kubernetes as the ultimate
  infrastructure management tool for research and AI/ML workloads. The Cloud Native
  & Kubernetes AI Day is aimed at seasoned practitioners as well as those new to the
  batch computing and MLOps worlds. Anyone looking for solutions and best practices
  to provide cost effective and efficient infrastructure to scale out batch computing,
  training and inference workloads, make the best use of scarce and expensive hardware
  accelerators and efficiently manage LLMs and agentic infrastructure. This event
  will also help practitioners of MLOps interact with maintainers of Cloud Native
  AI projects and foster collaboration between the two worlds. The theme this year
  is ‘agent,’ with multiple references and reports on Agentic AI and the cloud native
  infrastructure supporting it. This event will be a unique opportunity to connect
  and network with people driving this new generation infrastructure. We will have
  a full day with 10 full sessions and 4 lightning talks and enough time for questions
  during the sessions and discussion in the break outs. We will be hearing from researchers,
  project maintainers and many end users reporting on successes and challenges of
  running AI/ML workloads on top of cloud native infrastructure. While the sessions
  will be engaging, there will be ample time during coffee breaks and lunch for hallway
  tracks and networking sessions, helping attendees engage with speakers, maintainers
  of projects and end users.'
