  Bedrock of Successful Platform Engineering Transfer VMware Cloud Foundation (VCF)
  Operations Integration SDK Builds to a Private Container Registry in the deployed
  VCF Operations Environment VMware Cloud Foundation - Cloud on Your Terms Complexity
  has always been a core challenge when deploying cloud-native software such as Kubernetes.
  By extension, it is also a key consideration when implementing platform engineering
  practices and processes to manage cloud-native environments. To overcome the array
  of complexity-related challenges across infrastructures, applications, tools, and
  teams, enterprise organizations must enable simplified operations and maintain consistency
  with federated platforms that can integrate and evolve with a variety of technologies.
  Consolidated, unified platforms that support integration across venues and software
  components are critical to overcoming complexity. For Kubernetes, this also means
  supporting the many different open source components that make up an effective deployment,
  including orchestration, monitoring and observability, and security functions. Further,
  as cloud-native constructs and containers are deployed across a broader swath of
  enterprise applications, teams must centrally and consistently manage both container-based
  and VM-based applications on a single platform. Much like DevOps, platform engineering
  relies on breaking down silos within an organization to support teams and personas
  beyond software developers and IT admins (e. g. , cloud admins, platform engineers,
  security teams) with self-service capabilities, as well as aligned objectives and
  incentives to foster collaboration. Comprehensive, end-to-end platforms that seamlessly
  connect compute, storage, networking, and security resources with unified lifecycle
  management, and that also facilitate integrations across the software development
  and deployment process, can help enterprises to better support their broad array
  of applications and teams. This can help address complexity issues by allowing teams
  to centrally and consistently manage platforms using a common skillset, further
  reducing costs by reducing the need for new hires and talent acquisition. Conquering
  complexity and integration challenges associated with platform engineering can enable
  improved developer productivity, faster delivery time, improved security and higher-quality
  code—sought-after benefits that are frequently identified in our Voice of the Enterprise
  surveys.'
