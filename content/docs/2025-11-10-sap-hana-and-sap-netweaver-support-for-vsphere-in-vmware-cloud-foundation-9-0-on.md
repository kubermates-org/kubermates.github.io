  vSphere support in VCF 9 for SAP HANA 2.0 includes support for: Intel Xeon 6 with
  P-cores processors (Granite Rapids) Intel 5 th Gen Xeon Processor (Emerald Rapids)
  Intel 3 rd Gen Xeon Processor (Icelake) with SAP HANA VM standard configurations
  up to 4 TiB of memory and up to 344 vCPUs. EMR with workload based sizing up to
  6 TiB of memory. Validation for 2nd Gen Xeon ( Cascade Lake, Cooper Lake ) and 4
  th Gen Xeon ( Sapphire Rapids) processors supporting up to 16 TB and 960 vCPUs is
  currently in progress. Support for these Intel processors will be added later to
  SAP note 3663150 – SAP HANA on vSphere in VCF 9. *Estimated vaSAPS incorporate a
  maximal 10% virtualization overhead and are based on benchmark 2025064. Definition
  of aSAPS. Support for Intel Xeon 6 with P-Cores with vSphere 8 was released at the
  end of September 2025 (see SAP note 3372365 ), enabling seamless migration from
  vSphere 8 environments to vSphere in VMware Cloud and vSphere Foundation 9. The
  Intel Xeon 6 platform, with its support for up to 86 cores per socket and increased
  memory capacity and VCF 9, is an ideal choice for migrating existing virtualized
  or bare-metal SAP HANA systems from older SAP appliance hardware using CPU generations,
  such as Cascade Lake, which typically offered 0.75–1 TB per CPU, without the need
  for re-sizing or significant effort. For example, a previous 4 -socket server running
  2 nd Gen Intel Xeon (Cascade or Cooper Lake) 4 TB SAP HANA systems, can get migrated
  onto a 2 -socket 4 TB Intel Xeon 6 system without resizing required. The benefits
  of migrating and consolidating existing virtualized or bare-metal SAP HANA systems
  are clear: Reduced energy consumption Simplified architecture and operation Reduced
  downtime by leveraging enhanced vSphere features like vMotion or VMware HA Optimized
  total cost of ownership (TCO) Basic Migration Steps Verify SAP HANA VM sizing and
  select the appropriate Granite Rapids server configuration to avoid oversizing.'
