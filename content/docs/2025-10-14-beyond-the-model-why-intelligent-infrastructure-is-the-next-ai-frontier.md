  proof of concept (PoC) was a success. Now what? The jump from a single server to
  production-grade, distributed AI inference is where most enterprises hit a wall.
  The infrastructure that got you this far just can''t keep up. As discussed in a
  recent episode of the Technically Speaking podcast , most organizations'' AI journey
  and PoCs begin with deploying a model on a single server—a manageable task. But
  the next step often requires a massive leap to distributed, production-grade AI
  inference. This is not simply a matter of adding more machines—we believe this requires
  a new kind of intelligence within the infrastructure itself—an AI-aware control
  plane that can help manage the complexity of these unique and dynamic workloads.
  Deploying LLMs at scale introduces a set of challenges that traditional infrastructure
  isn''t designed to handle. A standard web server, for example, processes uniform
  requests. In contrast, an AI inference request can be unpredictable and resource-intensive,
  with variable demands on compute, memory, and networking. Think of it like modern
  logistics. Moving a small package from one city to another is straightforward. But
  coordinating a global supply chain requires intelligent logistics management—a system
  that can track thousands of shipments, dynamically route different types of cargo,
  and tweak scheduling so everything arrives on time.'
