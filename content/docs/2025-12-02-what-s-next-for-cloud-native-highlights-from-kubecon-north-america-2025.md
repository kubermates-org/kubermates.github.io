  North America 2025 Making Harbor Production-Ready: Essential Considerations for
  Deployment KubeCon + CloudNativeCon North America once again brought together thousands
  of developers, maintainers, operators, and end users from across the cloud native
  ecosystem. More than 9,000 attendees gathered in Atlanta, with nearly half joining
  for the first time, reflecting the accelerating global adoption of Kubernetes and
  open source innovation. For Broadcom, KubeCon is where we connect directly with
  the community that has shaped Kubernetes from its earliest days. It’s where we learn,
  share, and collaborate on the technologies that define modern cloud infrastructure.
  Here are the major themes that stood out this year and how we are helping customers
  take advantage of what’s next. A clear message emerged among a number of the keynotes
  and technical sessions: The future of AI is cloud native, and the future of cloud
  native is AI. Whether it was Adobe’s “Maximum Acceleration” keynote, Niantic’s real-time
  ML workflows, or Cohere’s enterprise AI architecture, it became evident that Kubernetes
  has become the foundation for training, serving, and governing AI models. These
  were some of the main takeaways : Inference is still the dominant enterprise AI
  workload, projected to drive hundreds of billions in investment over the next decade
  AI workloads need portability and interoperability across data centers and public
  clouds DRA (Dynamic Resource Allocation) is now the standard Kubernetes API for
  orchestrating accelerators and other specialized resources including GPUs, networking
  interfaces, and fine-grained CPI sharing. This is now GA in Kubernetes v1.34 Multi-cluster
  and multi-cloud operations are becoming standard patterns For more than two decades,
  we have engineered the operational foundations now required for large-scale AI:
  predictable scheduling, isolation boundaries, memory and CPU efficiency, and robust
  lifecycle automation. These strengths directly support the direction Kubernetes
  is heading. Our upstream work, including etcd improvements, leadership on long-term
  lifecycle stability, conformance engagement, and contributions across SIGs ensures
  our platforms adopt these emerging AI-native standards in a way enterprises can
  trust. This year, the CNCF formally launched Kubernetes AI Conformance, validating
  the essential set of capabilities required for portable and interoperable AI workloads.'
