summary: 'In the world of Kubernetes, managing containerized applications at scale
  requires powerful and efficient tools. The command-line interface (CLI) is an integral
  part of any developer or operator’s toolkit, offering a convenient and flexible
  way to interact with a Kubernetes cluster. SIG CLI plays a crucial role in improving
  the Kubernetes CLI experience by focusing on the development and enhancement of
  kubectl , the primary command-line tool for Kubernetes. In this SIG CLI Spotlight,
  Arpit Agrawal, SIG ContribEx-Comms team member, talked with Katrina Verey , Tech
  Lead & Chair of SIG CLI,and Maciej Szulik , SIG CLI Batch Lead, about SIG CLI, current
  projects, challenges and how anyone can get involved. So, whether you are a seasoned
  Kubernetes enthusiast or just getting started, understanding the significance of
  SIG CLI will undoubtedly enhance your Kubernetes journey. Arpit : Could you tell
  us a bit about yourself, your role, and how you got involved in SIG CLI? Maciej
  : I’m one of the technical leads for SIG-CLI. I was working on Kubernetes in multiple
  areas since 2014, and in 2018 I got appointed a lead. Katrina : I’ve been working
  with Kubernetes as an end-user since 2016, but it was only in late 2019 that I discovered
  how well SIG CLI aligned with my experience from internal projects. I started regularly
  attending meetings and made a few small PRs, and by 2021 I was working more deeply
  with the Kustomize team specifically. Later that year, I was appointed to my current
  roles as subproject owner for Kustomize and KRM Functions, and as SIG CLI Tech Lead
  and Chair. Arpit : Thank you! Could you share with us the purpose and goals of SIG
  CLI? Maciej : Our charter has the most detailed description, but in few words, we
  handle all CLI tooling that helps you manage your Kubernetes manifests and interact
  with your Kubernetes clusters. Arpit : I see.'
