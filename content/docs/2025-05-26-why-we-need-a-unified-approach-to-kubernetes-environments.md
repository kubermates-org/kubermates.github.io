summary: 'Challenges Managing Multiple Technologies Deploying Holistic Solutions to
  Drive Better Outcomes Meeting the Demands of Modern Application Architectures Today,
  organizations struggle managing disparate technologies for their Kubernetes networking
  and network security needs. Leveraging multiple technologies for networking and
  security for in-cluster, ingress, egress, and traffic across clusters creates challenges,
  including operational complexities and increased costs. For example, to manage ingress
  traffic for Kubernetes clusters, users cobble together multiple solutions from different
  providers such as ingress controllers or gateways and load balancers for routing
  traffic, as well as Web Application Firewalls (WAFs) for enhanced security. Despite
  the challenges it brings, deploying disparate technologies has been a “necessary
  evil” for organizations to get all the capabilities needed for holistic Kubernetes
  networking. Here, we’ll explore challenges this proliferation of tooling introduces,
  and provide actionable tips for today’s platform and security teams to overcome
  these issues. The fragmented approach to networking and network security in Kubernetes
  leads to challenges and inefficiencies, including: Operational overhead: Each technology
  comes with its own learning curve, setup, configuration, integration, and maintenance
  requirements. This leads to a challenging user experience. Increased costs: Licensing
  and operational costs accumulate as more tools are deployed. Scaling challenges:
  As clusters grow or spread across diverse environments, ensuring consistent and
  secure networking becomes harder. Security gaps: Disjointed solutions impair visibility
  and may create security gaps. Troubleshooting issues: Without a single pane of glass,
  troubleshooting and understanding latency issues across clusters is a common problem
  operators face. Take managing ingress traffic, and everything that goes with it.'
