summary: 'Today, organizations struggle managing disparate technologies for their
  Kubernetes networking and network security needs. Leveraging multiple technologies
  for networking and security for in-cluster, ingress, egress, and traffic across
  clusters creates challenges, including operational complexities and increased costs.
  For example, to manage ingress traffic for Kubernetes clusters, users cobble together
  multiple solutions from different providers such as ingress controllers or gateways
  and load balancers for routing traffic, as well as Web Application Firewalls (WAFs)
  for enhanced security. Despite the challenges it brings, deploying disparate technologies
  has been a “necessary evil” for organizations to get all the capabilities needed
  for holistic Kubernetes networking. Here, we’ll explore challenges this proliferation
  of tooling introduces, and provide actionable tips for today’s platform and security
  teams to overcome these issues. The fragmented approach to networking and network
  security in Kubernetes leads to challenges and inefficiencies, including: Take managing
  ingress traffic, and everything that goes with it. It is typical in a Kubernetes
  environment, that a user might need to manage multiple tools and services, such
  as cloud provider load balancers, application gateways, and ingress controllers
  like NGINX or others, to enable traffic flow and security. This can lead to complexity
  and fragmentation when integrating these components across your cloud infrastructure
  and Kubernetes clusters. The user is then required to learn about these individual
  tools, how they work, what their API is, how to manage them, deploy them, and troubleshoot
  them. And when it comes to troubleshooting, different sources for logging leads
  to issues identifying the source of an issue—and, in turn, challenges remediating
  said issue. Organizations can address these challenges by adopting a unified approach
  to Kubernetes networking. Deploying a single, unified solution for Kubernetes networking
  from the application to the networking layer eliminates the need for separate tools
  to manage ingress, egress, in-cluster, and cross-cluster traffic, significantly
  simplifying operations and reducing costs without compromising performance or security.'
