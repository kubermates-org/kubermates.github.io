  Share Digital sovereignty is not a new topic, but recent events on the world stage
  have catapulted it to the top of the top of boardroom agendas and government priorities
  alike. According to a 2025 BARC study , 84% of surveyed companies view data sovereignty
  as a central point of their strategy, and 70 percent report significantly increased
  relevance in the past one to two years. Meanwhile, industry analyst firm Gartner
  forecasts the sovereign cloud IaaS market will be worth $169 billion in 2028 , up
  from $37 billion last year. Different countries and organisations are adopting different
  approaches to digital and cloud sovereignty, some are cautiously waiting and watching
  to see how things shake out, others are acting fast. While there remains a certain
  degree of uncertainty over exactly what digital and cloud sovereignty looks like,
  most industry watchers agree that it will be ‘need to have’ rather than ‘nice to
  have. ’ For a broader perspective on digital sovereignty, we caught up with Red
  Hat country and regional leaders across Europe to test the waters in local markets.
  Gregor von Jagow, Country Manager, Germany: “We’re seeing demand across all sectors.
  ” Germany has long prioritized digital sovereignty, partly due to the cautious nature
  of its businesses. With geopolitical tensions and market consolidation, local cloud
  providers play a vital role. We partner with local players like IONOS and StackIT
  (a subsidiary of Schwarz Group) that are driving the sovereignty conversation in
  Germany. These providers are often best positioned to deliver the level of control
  and adherence to local regulations that truly define sovereign cloud solutions for
  customers. We’re seeing demand across all sectors, not just government.'
