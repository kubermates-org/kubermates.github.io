  \ and a clear path to savings. TL;DR Per-second billing for Droplets begins January\
  \ 1, 2026 to slash costs for ephemeral workloads. Read documentation to learn more\
  \ and understand your current billing details in the DigitalOcean console to prepare\
  \ for this change New dedicated Droplet plans are now generally available for a\
  \ seamless performance upgrade. Visit your DigitalOcean console to create these\
  \ new Droplets. Bring your own IP is now generally available to protect your IP\
  \ reputation. Check out our documentation or visit your DigitalOcean console to\
  \ bring your own ip. VPC NAT gateway is now available for public preview for centralized\
  \ egress and static IPs. Check out our documentation or visit your DigitalOcean\
  \ console to set up your NAT gateway. Traditional hourly billing models for virtual\
  \ machines have resulted in customers paying for idle time, even for short-lived\
  \ workloads. Effective Jan 1, 2026, our billing model will transition to a per-second\
  \ basis for Droplets , with a minimum charge of 60 seconds. This new approach aims\
  \ to optimize cost control by charging for exact usage over a minute, making it\
  \ simple to get precise billing for your actual usage."
