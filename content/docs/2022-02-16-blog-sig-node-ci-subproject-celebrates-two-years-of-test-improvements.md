summary: 'SIG Node CI Subproject Celebrates Two Years of Test Improvements Timeline
  Statistics Future Authors: Sergey Kanzhelev (Google), Elana Hashman (Red Hat) Ensuring
  the reliability of SIG Node upstream code is a continuous effort that takes a lot
  of behind-the-scenes effort from many contributors. There are frequent releases
  of Kubernetes, base operating systems, container runtimes, and test infrastructure
  that result in a complex matrix that requires attention and steady investment to
  “keep the lights on. ” In May 2020, the Kubernetes node special interest group (“SIG
  Node”) organized a new subproject for continuous integration (CI) for node-related
  code and tests. Since its inauguration, the SIG Node CI subproject has run a weekly
  meeting, and even the full hour is often not enough to complete triage of all bugs,
  test-related PRs and issues, and discuss all related ongoing work within the subgroup.
  Over the past two years, we’ve fixed merge-blocking and release-blocking tests,
  reducing time to merge Kubernetes contributors’ pull requests thanks to reduced
  test flakes. When we started, Node test jobs only passed 42% of the time, and through
  our efforts, we now ensure a consistent >90% job pass rate. We’ve closed 144 test
  failure issues and merged 176 pull requests just in kubernetes/kubernetes. And we’ve
  helped subproject participants ascend the Kubernetes contributor ladder, with 3
  new org members, 6 new reviewers, and 2 new approvers. The Node CI subproject is
  an approachable first stop to help new contributors get started with SIG Node. There
  is a low barrier to entry for new contributors to address high-impact bugs and test
  fixes, although there is a long road before contributors can climb the entire contributor
  ladder: it took over a year to establish two new approvers for the group. The complexity
  of all the different components that power Kubernetes nodes and its test infrastructure
  requires a sustained investment over a long period for developers to deeply understand
  the entire system, both at high and low levels of detail. We have several regular
  contributors at our meetings, however; our reviewers and approvers pool is still
  small.'
