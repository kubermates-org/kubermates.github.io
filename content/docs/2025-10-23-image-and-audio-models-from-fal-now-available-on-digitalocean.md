  \ without worrying about infrastructure, scaling, or vendor management. With this\
  \ release, building AI-powered applications that include visual and audio content\
  \ is easier than ever. The fal models, now in public preview, cover a variety of\
  \ modalities, enabling you to experiment, prototype, and deploy multimodal AI features\

  \ These models are available via Serverless Inference, letting you generate images\
  \ and audio through the same simple API-driven workflow you already use on Gradient\
  \ AI Platform. You can start using these models through the Serverless Inference\
  \ API ( https://inference. do-ai. run ) after opting in to the public preview in\
  \ the DigitalOcean console. Hereâ\x80\x99s a quick look at how to interact with\
  \ them: https://inference. do-ai. run First, opt in to the public preview to access\
  \ the fal models on the Gradient AI Platform."
