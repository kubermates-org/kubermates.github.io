summary: 'The Situation: The Ingress Rut Kubernetes Gateway API vs. Ingress: The Core
  Differences 🤔 The Implication: Tied Hands and Increased Risk The Resolution: Gateway
  API Meets Calico The Outcome: Secure, Streamlined, and Standardized If you’ve managed
  traffic in Kubernetes, you’ve likely navigated the world of Ingress controllers.
  For years, Ingress has been the standard way of getting HTTP/S services exposed.
  But let’s be honest, it often felt like a compromise. We wrestled with controller-specific
  annotations to unlock critical features, blurred the lines between infrastructure
  and application concerns, this complexity didn’t just make portability more difficult,
  it sometimes led to security vulnerabilities and other complications. As part of
  Calico Open Source v3.30 , we have released a free and open source Calico Ingress
  Gateway that implements a custom built Envoy proxy with the Kubernetes Gateway API
  standard to help you navigate Ingress complexities with style. This blog post is
  designed to get you up to speed on why such a change might be the missing link in
  your environment. The challenge with traditional Ingress wasn’t a lack of effort,
  since the landscape is full of innovative solutions. However, the problem was the
  lack of a unified, expressive, and role-aware standard. Existing ingress controllers
  were capable, implemented advanced features, however at the same time tied you to
  a specific project/vendor. This meant: Vendor Lock-In: Migrating from one ingress
  controller to another became a painful exercise in translating a web of custom annotations.
  Configurations were tied to the implementation, not the intent.'
