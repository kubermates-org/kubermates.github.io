  Infrastructure Applications Virtualization Share IT leaders face many challenges
  today, but few are as daunting as this: How do you keep up with the pace of change
  when your existing IT infrastructure is already so complex? For many enterprises,
  the primary source of that complexity is the struggle to manage containerized applications
  at scale across diverse environments—from on-premises data centers to multiple public
  clouds. This fragmentation can lead to inconsistent operations and vendor lock-in,
  which stifles agility and innovation. As we navigate the era of AI, IT leaders need
  a unified, predictable way to manage it all so that your teams can focus on higher-value
  work. I''ve had the unique opportunity to see this problem from both sides. In my
  previous roles leading customer-facing teams, I saw firsthand how our customers
  leveraged Red Hat OpenShift to tackle their most complex challenges, such as streamlining
  their hybrid cloud experiences and reducing operational complexity. It was profoundly
  rewarding to see them use our platform to break free from the status quo. Now, as
  the CIO of Red Hat, my perspective has shifted to that of an internal customer.
  I see the immense value of OpenShift even more clearly because we also use it to
  run Red Hat’s business. We are our own customer zero, not because our leadership
  team mandates it, but because the product works for us. Our experience has been
  a testament to the platform''s power to create consistency across our hybrid cloud
  environment, which has been critical for managing our global operations. Our teams
  have seen significant improvements, including shorter cycle times from code to production
  and better standardization of application architectures. By using OpenShift, our
  applications have improved cloud agility, allowing them to move across our hybrid
  cloud environment without concern for the underlying infrastructure.'
