  Applications Virtualization Share Note: This post is the first in a series that
  will take readers inside our AI projects, share how we’re equipping our engineers
  for the AI era, and dig into the legal and ethical frameworks we’re grappling with
  at Red Hat. Our intention is to not only highlight our practices, but also start
  discussions and spur ideas on the future of software development. The world of technology
  is in the midst of a seismic shift. Artificial intelligence, particularly generative
  AI (gen AI), is rapidly evolving from a futuristic concept into a tangible tool
  with the potential to redefine how we build software. For those of us who have built
  our careers on open source principles of software development, this moment is pivotal.
  And a bit unnerving. At Red Hat, we''ve always believed that the most powerful innovations
  are born from collaboration, transparency, and a shared commitment to solving complex
  problems. As we head into the AI era, we believe these same principles are not just
  relevant, but essential. Using AI in open source isn''t about replacing the developer;
  it''s about empowering them. It’s about enhancing the creativity and ingenuity that
  has always been at the heart of open source. We see AI as a powerful new collaborator
  in the open source community—a tool that can help us scale software development,
  tackle more ambitious projects, and accelerate the pace of innovation for everyone.
  Red Hat is all-in on unlocking the potential of AI, and we intend to bring this
  to the communities we’re part of.'
