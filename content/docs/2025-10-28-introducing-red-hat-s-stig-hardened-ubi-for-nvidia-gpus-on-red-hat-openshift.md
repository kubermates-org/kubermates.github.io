  Share Deploying cutting-edge AI in U. S. government environments can present a formidable
  challenge. While the power of accelerated computing is essential for modern workloads,
  the path to achieving an Authority to Operate (ATO) is paved with the complex and
  time-consuming demands of applying controls such as the Defense Information Systems
  Agency’s (DISA) Security Technical Implementation Guides (STIGs). This crucial security
  hardening process can be a manual, painstaking effort that creates friction between
  development teams and security mandates, slowing innovation. Today, Red Hat is reducing
  that friction at the source with the release of a STIG-hardened Red Hat Universal
  Base Image (UBI-STIG). NVIDIA is leveraging this new, hardened container image as
  the foundation for a government-ready NVIDIA GPU Operator that works with Red Hat
  OpenShift. As part of this effort, Red Hat is also supported in the NVIDIA AI Factory
  for Government reference design to accelerate deployments of AI agents and applications
  in federal and enterprise deployments. The NVIDIA AI Factory for Government is a
  full-stack, end-to-end reference design that provides guidance for deploying agentic
  AI, physical AI, and HPC workloads on-premises and in the hybrid cloud, while meeting
  the compliance needs of federal and other high assurance organizations. The reference
  design is based on the NVIDIA Blackwell platform and integrates NVIDIA-Certified
  Systems, NVIDIA-Certified Storage, and a broad technology partner ecosystem, including
  Red Hat. This collaboration is a game-changer for government partners and agencies.
  By leveraging UBI-STIG to create a hardened GPU driver image, NVIDIA is able to
  include GPU Operator as a part of its government-ready NVIDIA AI Enterprise software.
