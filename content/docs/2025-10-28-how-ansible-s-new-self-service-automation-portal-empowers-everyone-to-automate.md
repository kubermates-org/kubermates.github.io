  Platform are clear, but gaining organization-wide adoption can still be challenging.
  Although the core automation platform team manages the platform and develops automation
  content, the real value comes from extending automation to a broader group of IT
  professionals. These individuals, who may not possess deep Ansible expertise, bring
  valuable use cases and stand to gain immensely from the platform, without needing
  to get bogged down in its technical details. The success of Ansible Automation Platform
  hinges not just on platform administrators and developers, but on the widespread
  adoption of automation across the entire organization. With the release of Ansible
  Automation Platform 2.6 and its self-service automation portal, organization-wide
  adoption is attainable. Network administrators who aren’t familiar with Ansible
  Playbooks or workflows face many challenges. These include: Onboarding: The time
  and effort it takes to teach new users about Ansible Automation Platform can be
  significant if they’ve never used it. Service tickets: Skilled automation teams
  often get overwhelmed with service tickets from users who just need to run existing
  automation. Adoption: The full value of the Ansible Automation Platform isn''t realized
  if only a handful of skilled people are using it. The self-service automation portal
  directly addresses these challenges by providing a streamlined approach to empower
  subject matter experts (SMEs) with the automation capabilities they need, without
  requiring deep Ansible expertise. It’s simple, intuitive user interface (UI) creates
  a tailored experience based on a user’s role and access privileges. Here’s how it
  works: Simple, focused UI: The user interface is stripped down to the essentials.'
