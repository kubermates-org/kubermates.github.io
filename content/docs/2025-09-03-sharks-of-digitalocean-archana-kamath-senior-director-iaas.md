  \ Her technical leadership has been instrumental in shaping DigitalOceanâ\x80\x99\
  s cloud platform development. â\x80\x9CIâ\x80\x99ve been with DO for a little over\
  \ six years, and there are a few things that make this the perfect place to work\
  \ for me personally. First is the concept of DO Simple that goes into building all\
  \ of our products. Taking super complex scenarios and simplifying them for customers\
  \ is such an interesting challenge, and one that I love solving for. Second is the\
  \ culture at DO. Our values drive velocity and iterative development in a collaborative\
  \ environment, always focusing on solving customer pain points. That alignment with\
  \ both innovation and empathy is what makes working here so meaningful for me. â\x80\

  ï¸\x8F â\x80\x9CWhat excites me most is the unique opportunity we have to disrupt\
  \ the space of cloud computing, and more recently, AI/ML. The DO Simple approach\
  \ is customer-centric and focused on making cloud computing accessible for a wide\
  \ range of use cases. The AI/ML space is still in its early days, but itâ\x80\x99\
  s already revolutionizing the tech industry."
