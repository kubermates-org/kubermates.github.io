  Platform Engineering VMware Advanced Cyber Compliance is Now Available to VCF Customers
  Following the announcement at VMware Explore earlier this year, we are now making
  a new Advanced Service generally available for VMware Cloud Foundation (VCF) customers.
  Starting November 3rd, VCF customers can purchase VMware Advanced Cyber Compliance
  , an offering engineered to elevate security policy compliance, cyber risk management
  and platform security for organizations who operate in heavily regulated environments,
  or who simply want more robust functionality to support their critical business
  needs. In this modern threat landscape, security, compliance and resilience have
  become more tightly linked than ever before. An organization’s ability to prevent,
  detect, mitigate and recover from cyberattacks and non-compliance drifts can determine
  not just its success, but its survival. However, solutions available today fail
  to deliver a comprehensive end-to-end approach that enables successful outcomes
  across this spectrum of use cases. This generates operational inefficiencies, siloed
  visibility, as well as increased risk of data loss and non-compliance. VMware Advanced
  Cyber Compliance combines the power of proven VMware technologies with new capabilities
  to holistically address pressing challenges organizations face as regulatory compliance
  requirements become increasingly stringent and cyberattacks more sophisticated.
  The offering builds on a robust set of compliance management, infrastructure availability
  and security capabilities that are already built into our core platform and available
  to customers with core VCF entitlements. Customers can unlock elevated platform-level
  value for VCF environments leveraging the following innovations: Compliance Enforcement
  at Scale Siloed policy management hinders drift detection and leads to reactive
  vs. proactive responses which could put organizations at risk. Powered by VMware
  Salt, VMware Advanced Cyber Compliance offers centralized configuration management
  that allows IT teams to provision, configure, deploy, manage, and monitor nodes
  efficiently at massive scale. With event-driven automation, they can quickly execute
  commands on individual or groups of virtual machines (VMs) to make sure all nodes
  operate consistently in the desired state and enforce compliant software configurations
  throughout the infrastructure.'
