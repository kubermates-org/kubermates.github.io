  Hat Lightspeed (formerly Red Hat Insights) has long helped operations teams detect
  risks, open tickets, and share findings with the right tools, connecting proactive
  intelligence to everyday workflows. Much has changed, not only in Red Hat Lightspeed
  itself, but also in how organizations are using it. Across industries, teams have
  built custom dashboards, reporting portals, and IT service management (ITSM) integrations
  powered by the Red Hat Lightspeed API. Others have connected Red Hat Lightspeed
  data into continuous integration and delivery (CI/CD) pipelines, monitoring environments,
  and automated remediation workflows, turning operational intelligence into action.
  Today, that vision has expanded. Integrations have matured, authentication has evolved,
  and new automation paths now let you go beyond “alerting” toward closed-loop, intelligent
  remediation—where Red Hat Lightspeed findings can directly trigger actions across
  your automation and observability stack. This post explores what’s new in 2025,
  including token-based authentication, updated integrations, Event-Driven Ansible,
  and the new Model Context Protocol (MCP) server, and how these security-focused
  capabilities help you connect insight to action. The Red Hat Lightspeed team has
  modernized its API authentication model to support service account–based, token-driven
  access , marking a major step forward in both security and automation flexibility.
  Previously, API integrations relied on user credentials and basic authentication.
  While functional at the time, this approach made it difficult to automate at scale
  or enforce consistent access controls across multiple systems. Basic authentication
  has since been deprecated and is no longer supported, reinforcing a shift toward
  more security-focused, scalable, token-based access.'
