summary: "By Bratin Saha, Chief Product & Technology Officer AI is shaping up to be\
  \ one of the most transformational technologies of our lifetimes and will change\
  \ how we live and work just like the PC, the internet, and the smartphone did. The\
  \ launch of ChatGPT was a seminal moment in the evolution of AI, and since then,\
  \ AIâ\x80\x99s adoption has accelerated. According to â\x80\x9C The rapid adoption\
  \ of Generative AI. Bick, Blandin, & Deming (2024 )â\x80\x9D, AI is being adopted\
  \ at twice the rate of the PC and internet at a similar point in their evolution.\
  \ Not just adoption, the rate of innovation in AI has been faster than anything\
  \ we have seen before. So where is AI headed? To answer this question, let us start\
  \ by looking at how other transformational technologies have evolved throughout\
  \ history. Take the Internet for example â\x80\x93 it started with the infrastructure\
  \ - with routers and network switches. But the true inflection point came with the\
  \ emergence of platform capabilities, such as web browsers and HTML, which allowed\
  \ people to build and use applications like search engines, e-commerce, and social\
  \ media. If you look at the PC, microprocessors and memory and other infrastructure\
  \ components came first. But what triggered the massive adoption was the creation\
  \ of a platform â\x80\x93 WinTel, which provided a standardized environment for\
  \ developing and running PC applications. Same with the smartphones; the infrastructure\
  \ started first with modems and cell towers, but it really took off when a platform\
  \ enabled the creation and use of applications. AI will follow a similar IPA ( I\
  \ nfrastructure -> P latform -> A pplication) model, with the innovation moving\
  \ from Infrastructure (e."
