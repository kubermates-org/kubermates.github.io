  Infrastructure Applications Virtualization Share Vodafone is transforming its 5G
  telco cloud operations by embracing OpenShift, validated patterns, and GitOps to
  streamline its lifecycle management of Kubernetes clusters. Tom Kivlin, Principal
  Cloud Architect at Vodafone, recently shared insights into their journey, highlighting
  the challenges overcome and the benefits realized through this strategic approach.
  He spoke at OpenShift Commons in London earlier this year. Traditional telecommunication
  service provider environments tend to operate at a slower pace compared to the rapid
  release cycles of Kubernetes, which sees three releases per year. Vodafone overcame
  hurdles in managing the lifecycle of their Kubernetes clusters, including: Faster
  pace of lifecycle operations : The adoption of containers and Kubernetes in its
  5G network to necessitate quicker feature releases and software updates, demanding
  more frequent upgrades. Complex dependencies : Tackling inconsistencies resulting
  from intricate relationships between 5G software applications and the platform itself,
  often managed through spreadsheets. Complex dependencies are written in one single
  location, making them easier to discover. Manual management and human error : Improving
  manual lifecycle management of clusters which could lead to issues during pre-production
  testing and validation. This avoids using manual deployments and "quick & dirty"
  fixes. Time-consuming and high-risk deployments : Avoiding these time consuming
  and high-risk deployments by having everything well defined as code in a single,
  tracked and traced common repository made things smoother and faster. Using "validated
  patterns" reuses common components that have been shared and improved by the community
  “If you are managing the lifecycle of these clusters manually,” said Kivlin, “that
  can lead to problems that need fixing in pre-production as you''re doing lifecycle
  operation testing and validation. We wish to avoid this to ensure deployments and
  upgrades are quick yet effective.'
