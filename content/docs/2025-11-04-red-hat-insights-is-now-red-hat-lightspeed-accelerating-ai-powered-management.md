  Applications Virtualization Share Red Hat Insights is now Red Hat Lightspeed, reflecting
  our next step in bringing AI-powered management to Red Hat platforms. This change
  builds on the foundation we''ve established with Red Hat Insights, and extends our
  commitment to integrating intelligence, predictive analytics, and risk management
  across the Red Hat portfolio. For years, Red Hat Insights has been a core part of
  every Red Hat subscription, helping you manage your environments across Red Hat
  Enterprise Linux, Red Hat OpenShift, and Red Hat Ansible Automation Platform. Red
  Hat Lightspeed continues to provide you with powerful, predictive analytics that
  help you work faster, smarter, and with greater security and expands the reach of
  these capabilities with AI-driven insights that help you operate more efficiently
  and securely at scale. The capabilities you already depend on are still here, built
  into your Red Hat subscription and accessible through the same workflows and interfaces
  you use today. We''re enhancing the level of intelligence and automation behind
  them by introducing AI-enhanced context, recommendations, and automation that make
  Red Hat Lightspeed more efficient and more adaptive to your environment. Move faster
  : Identify and resolve issues sooner with AI-assisted analysis that anticipates
  risks and accelerates remediation. Gain deeper clarity : Combine years of operational
  data with pattern recognition to surface insights that help you make informed decisions
  across infrastructure, cost, and performance. Strengthen your security posture :
  Extend existing vulnerability and compliance capabilities with AI-driven prioritization
  that helps you focus on the most critical exposures first. Work seamlessly within
  your workflows : Continue using your existing integrations with Red Hat Ansible
  Automation Platform, ServiceNow, Splunk, and others, now augmented with more intelligent
  recommendations and automation paths that fit naturally into your daily operations.
  With Red Hat Lightspeed, you''ll continue using the same workflows, console entry
  points, and integrations that you rely on today. All existing capabilities remain
  available, and there''s no action required on your part to keep using them.'
