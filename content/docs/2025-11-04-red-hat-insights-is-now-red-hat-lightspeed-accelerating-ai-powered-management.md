  Share Red Hat Insights is now Red Hat Lightspeed, reflecting our next step in bringing
  AI-powered management to Red Hat platforms. This change builds on the foundation
  we''ve established with Red Hat Insights, and extends our commitment to integrating
  intelligence, predictive analytics, and risk management across the Red Hat portfolio.
  For years, Red Hat Insights has been a core part of every Red Hat subscription,
  helping you manage your environments across Red Hat Enterprise Linux, Red Hat OpenShift,
  and Red Hat Ansible Automation Platform. Red Hat Lightspeed continues to provide
  you with powerful, predictive analytics that help you work faster, smarter, and
  with greater security and expands the reach of these capabilities with AI-driven
  insights that help you operate more efficiently and securely at scale. The capabilities
  you already depend on are still here, built into your Red Hat subscription and accessible
  through the same workflows and interfaces you use today. We''re enhancing the level
  of intelligence and automation behind them by introducing AI-enhanced context, recommendations,
  and automation that make Red Hat Lightspeed more efficient and more adaptive to
  your environment. Move faster: Identify and resolve issues sooner with AI-assisted
  analysis that anticipates risks and accelerates remediation. Gain deeper clarity:
  Combine years of operational data with pattern recognition to surface insights that
  help you make informed decisions across infrastructure, cost, and performance. Strengthen
  your security posture: Extend existing vulnerability and compliance capabilities
  with AI-driven prioritization that helps you focus on the most critical exposures
  first. Work seamlessly within your workflows: Continue using your existing integrations
  with Red Hat Ansible Automation Platform, ServiceNow, Splunk, and others, now augmented
  with more intelligent recommendations and automation paths that fit naturally into
  your daily operations. With Red Hat Lightspeed, you''ll continue using the same
  workflows, console entry points, and integrations that you rely on today. All existing
  capabilities remain available, and there''s no action required on your part to keep
  using them.'
