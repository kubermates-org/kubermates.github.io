  Mode Ingress Gives Way to Gateway APIs Gateway API: The Future of Kubernetes Ingress
  What’s Next? Prediction: The next evolution of Kubernetes is not about scale alone,
  but about intelligence, autonomy, and governance. As part of the article ‘ AI and
  Enterprise Technology Predictions from Industry Experts for 2026′ , published by
  Solutions Review, Ratan Tipirneni, CEO of Tigera, shares his perspective on how
  AI and cloud-native technologies are shaping the future of Kubernetes. His predictions
  describe how production clusters are evolving as AI becomes a core part of enterprise
  platforms, introducing new requirements for security, networking, and operational
  control. Looking toward 2026, Tipirneni expects Kubernetes to move beyond its traditional
  role of running microservices and stateless applications. Clusters will increasingly
  support AI-driven components that operate with greater autonomy and interact directly
  with other services and systems. This shift places new demands on platform teams
  around workload identity, access control, traffic management, and policy enforcement.
  It also drives changes in how APIs are governed and how network infrastructure is
  designed inside the cluster. Read on to explore Tipirneni’s predictions and what
  they mean for teams preparing Kubernetes platforms for an AI-driven future. By 2026,
  Tipirneni predicts that Kubernetes environments will increasingly host agent-based
  workloads rather than only traditional cloud native applications. These AI-driven
  agents will operate directly inside clusters, creating new complexity for platform
  and security teams. “Agents are autonomous and non-deterministic. You cannot predict
  which agents are going to talk to other agents or what actions they will take.'
