  Share The technology roundup is being redefined by a confluence of critical priorities:
  Securing the software supply chain, finding a definitive playbook for virtualization,
  and making the strategic leap into enterprise AI governance. This roundup highlights
  the articles that have proven most essential for executing these priorities. We’ve
  collected the most strategically relevant insights covering everything from new
  AI assistant features in Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) and Red Hat Ansible Automation
  Platform to the governance models needed for GitOps and infrastructure modernization.
  Use this list as your guide to making well-informed decisions across your hybrid
  cloud footprint. The evolution of Red Hat Ansible Lightspeed AI isn’t just for code
  generation anymore. This article announces the formal release of the Red Hat Ansible
  Lightspeed intelligent assistant, a gen AI service embedded right into the platform’s
  user interface (UI). It serves as an instant subject matter expert (SME) for administrators
  and operators, using Red Hat documentation to streamline troubleshooting and onboarding
  processes. Read how it cuts down on operational friction by answering critical questions
  like “How do I manage user access?” and provides transparency with referenced links—all
  without leaving the automation platform. Fedora 43 Beta now available The release
  of Fedora 43 Beta provides a crucial early look at the innovations that will ultimately
  shape the RHEL family. Learn more about how this release is focused on improving
  the day-to-day experience for sysadmins and developers. Key updates include moving
  the installer to the modern Anaconda WebUI by default and the introduction of DNF5
  for package management. For developers, the updated GNU toolchain and new language
  versions like Python 3.14 and Golang 1.25 provide a reliable platform for building
  modern applications.'
