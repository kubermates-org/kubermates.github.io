summary: 'Prow and Tide for Kubernetes Contributors Why is this helpful Back to squashing
  Assignment, review, approval. More about Prow and Tide More advanced usage Authors:
  Chris Short , Frederico Muñoz In my work in the Kubernetes world, I look up a label
  or Prow command often. The systems behind the scenes ( Prow and Tide ) are here
  to help Kubernetes Contributors get stuff done. Labeling which SIG, WG, or subproject
  is as important as the issue or PR having someone assigned. To quote the docs ,
  “Tide is a Prow component for managing a pool of GitHub PRs that match a given set
  of criteria. It will automatically retest PRs that meet the criteria (’tide comes
  in’) and automatically merge them when they have up-to-date passing test results
  (’tide goes out’). ” What actually prompted this article is the awesomely amazing
  folks on the Contributor Comms team saying, “I need to squash my commits and push
  that. ” Which immediately made me remember the wonder of the Tide label: tide/merge-method-squash.
  tide/merge-method-squash Contributing to Kubernetes will, most of the time, involve
  some kind of git-based action, specifically on the Kubernetes GitHub. This can be
  an obstacle to those less exposed to git and/or GitHub, and is especially noticeable
  when we’re dealing with non-code contributions (documentation, blog posts, etc.
  ). git When a contributor submits something, it will generally be through a pull
  request.'
