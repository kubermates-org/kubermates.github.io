summary: 'Author : Pushkar Joglekar (VMware) Accompanying the release of Kubernetes
  v1. 25, we announced availability of an official CVE feed as an alpha feature. This
  blog will cover how we implemented this feature. An auto-refreshing CVE feed allows
  users and implementers to programmatically fetch the list of CVEs announced by the
  Kubernetes SRC (Security Response Committee). To ensure freshness and minimal maintainer
  overhead, the feed updates automatically by fetching the CVE related information
  from the CVE announcement GitHub Issues. Creating these issues is already part of
  the existing Security Response Committee (SRC) workflow. Until December 2021, it
  was not possible to filter for issues or PRs that are tied to CVEs announced by
  Kubernetes SRC. We added a new label, official-cve-feed to address that, and SIG-Security
  labelled relevant issues with it. The in-scope issues are closed issues for which
  there is a CVE ID(s) and is officially announced as a Kubernetes security vulnerability
  by SRC. You can now filter on all of these issues and find them here. For future
  security vulnerabilities, we added the label to the SRC playbook so that all the
  future in-scope issues will automatically have this label. For the next step, we
  created a prow job in order to periodically query the GitHub REST API and pull the
  relevant issues.'
