  Edge computing Infrastructure Applications Virtualization Share Worldpay has fundamentally
  transformed its development processes by leveraging Red Hat OpenShift as the foundation
  for its internal developer platform, dubbed the Global Kubernetes Orchestration
  Platform (GKOP). This strategic shift has enabled Worldpay to empower its development
  teams with self-service capabilities, fostering a culture of collaboration and efficiency.
  Launched in 2020, GKOP is an enterprise platform built on Red Hat OpenShift Service
  on AWS (ROSA), a fully managed turnkey application platform. It is PCI DSS compliant
  and manages a fleet of 28 clusters across multiple regions. Worldpay views GKOP
  as a product, not just a platform. Things must run smoothly and reliably, so the
  GKOP team has built extensive automation around it. “GKOP is our product, because
  it''s so much more than just OpenShift. We built a lot of automation around it so
  the backbone of GKOP is the orchestration and configuration management. We asked
  ourselves ‘How do we do it? How do we run a fleet of clusters and manage them at
  scale?" asked Bernd Malmqvist, director of platform engineering at Worldpay. “Our
  cluster management basically is rendering the configuration [which is then] applied
  to downstream clusters… In disaster recovery exercises, we delete a region and rebuild
  it from scratch, from start to finish, within one and a half hours. We achieve this
  because the configuration is pre-rendered. When a cluster comes back online, configuration
  can be instantly applied.'
