  Open Source Conclusion As Kubernetes environments grow in scale and complexity,
  platform teams face increasing pressure to secure workloads without slowing down
  application delivery. But managing and enforcing network policies in Kubernetes
  is notoriously difficult—especially when visibility into pod-to-pod communication
  is limited or nonexistent. Teams are often forced to rely on manual traffic inspection,
  standalone logs, or trial-and-error policy changes, increasing the risk of misconfiguration
  and service disruption. Safe policy management and microsegmentation becomes a daunting
  task without clear knowledge or insight into which services should communicate with
  each other. In this detailed look, we’ll explore how Calico Cloud Free Tier builds
  upon Calico Open Source , and helps platform teams visualize traffic with a dynamic
  service graph, simplifies policy management, and even analyzes actual traffic to
  recommend policies. Calico Cloud Free Tier is a managed SaaS, no-cost offering that
  extends the capabilities of Calico Open Source 3.30 and higher to help Kubernetes
  teams improve network visibility, simplify policy management, and improve security
  by simplifying microsegmentation. Designed for single-cluster environments, it provides
  platform engineers and operators with powerful observability and policy management
  tools. With a seamless onboarding experience for users already running Calico Open
  Source 3.30 or higher, Calico Cloud Free Tier empowers teams to take control of
  their Kubernetes traffic—without additional cost or vendor lock-in. Let’s take a
  closer look at the key features that make Calico Cloud Free Tier a powerful solution
  for Kubernetes network security and observability: Calico’s primary observability
  solution is Dynamic Service Graph , a powerful visualization tool that maps real-time
  pod-to-pod communication across your cluster. This Service Graph, which is available
  in Calico Cloud Free Tier, gives you an immediate understanding of how workloads
  interact, making it far easier to identify unexpected traffic patterns or missing
  connections. Need to troubleshoot a failed service call? Simply drill down into
  the graph to access real-time flow logs with detailed packet and policy metadata.
  This eliminates the guesswork from debugging and speeds up root-cause analysis dramatically.'
