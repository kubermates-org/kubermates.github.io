  Virtualization Share This week we announced that for the third consecutive year,
  Red Hat has been named a Leader in the Gartner® Magic Quadrant™ for Container Management.
  We’re thrilled by this recognition and believe it represents continued validation
  of Red Hat OpenShift’s strong execution and strategy for delivering an industry
  leading application platform across hybrid environments from the data center, to
  the cloud, and to the edge. Red Hat OpenShift is recognized for its ability to execute
  and completeness of vision. Red Hat’s investments in OpenShift as a platform for
  AI workloads, and in building AI capabilities directly into the product to make
  users’ jobs easier. We believe it is also reflected in Red Hat’s position in the
  Gartner Magic Quadrant. OpenShift provides a comprehensive application platform
  with container management capabilities, including support for virtual machine workloads
  and AI-powered services. Magic Quadrant reports are a culmination of rigorous, fact-based
  research in specific markets, providing a wide-angle view of the relative positions
  of the providers in markets where growth is high and provider differentiation is
  distinct. Providers are positioned into four quadrants: Leaders, Challengers, Visionaries
  and Niche Players. Leaders execute well against their current vision and are well
  positioned for tomorrow. The research enables you to get the most from market analysis
  in alignment with your unique business and technology needs. Gartner defines container
  management as offerings that support the deployment and operation of containerized
  workloads and associated resources. It uses a combination of technologies (many
  open source) that enable agile application deployments and infrastructure modernization.'
