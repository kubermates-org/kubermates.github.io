summary: 'Mainframes Are the New AI Infrastructure. Protect it with Secure AI Mainframes:
  AI Infrastructure for Next Generation Applications AI and Containerization on the
  Mainframe Introducing Aqua Secure AI Bringing Aqua Security to IBM Z and IBM LinuxONE
  Modernize Without Compromise If your AI workloads run in containers, then securing
  those containers is the first and most important step in protecting your AI. And
  as enterprises begin to deploy containerized AI workloads on Red Hat OpenShift for
  mainframe environments, that priority becomes even more urgent. IBM Z and IBM LinuxONE,
  long trusted to power the world’s most critical business systems are now evolving
  into innovation hubs, supporting advanced, containerized applications. With this
  transformation comes a new challenge: securing the infrastructure behind your most
  sensitive and high-stakes workloads The rise of generative AI and large language
  models (LLMs) has changed how organizations build and deliver value. From real-time
  fraud detection to intelligent customer support, AI is becoming embedded in nearly
  every business function. According to a recent McKinsey study , “ 78 percent of
  respondents say their organizations use AI in at least one business function, up
  from 72 percent in early 2024. ” These AI workloads are built and deployed in containers.
  Why? Containers offer portability, scalability, and efficiency, which makes them
  ideal for AI training, inference, and everything in between. IDC projects that 1
  billion new logical applications will be created by 2028, resulting in more than
  10 billion container instances across enterprise environments. These billions of
  containers won’t just run in a general purpose cloud. They will be deployed on purpose
  built hardware.'
