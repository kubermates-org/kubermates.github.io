  platform engineer, Kubernetes maintainer, or open source contributor, we’d love
  to chat with you onsite at Booth #1010. Plus, we’re participating in several community-led
  sessions and have booth demos you won’t want to miss — plus plenty of time to connect
  in person at our booth. Discover why VMware vSphere Kubernetes Service (VKS) is
  the runtime of choice for the private cloud: CNCF certified Kubernetes runtime,
  which runs all apps LTS for Kubernetes minor releases Built-in integration with
  common platform engineering tools, such as Argo, Helm Multi-cluster lifecycle management,
  policy and backup at scale Single API across a robust set of building-block services,
  including AI CNCF certified Kubernetes runtime, which runs all apps LTS for Kubernetes
  minor releases Built-in integration with common platform engineering tools, such

  hub for all things VMware + Kubernetes: Watch demos highlighting Configure Kubernetes
  in Minutes – Fast deploy, on-demand versions, scalability Deploy Workloads in a
  Powerful Ecosystem – Conformant Kubernetes with packages, flexible container choices
  Operate Real VMs with Kubernetes – Operate VMs through Kubernetes APIs with VM service
  Advance CNCF Together – VMware’s contributions across CNCF projects Meet our experts
  who are contributing to important open-source projects such as Cluster API, Contour,
  etcd, Harbor, Containerd , and others. Our engineers are available for 1:1 conversations
  to discuss open-source solutions that simplify, secure, and scale modern applications
  Ask questions about VMware + Kubernetes convergence, etcd reliability, resilient
  infrastructure, and more Discuss all about VKS – upcoming capabilities and roadmap
  directions Schedule deeper dives with our technical experts Watch demos highlighting

  Join us for the Demo Theater Session: Title: Running etcd in Production: Best Practices
  & Rescue Recipes Time: November 12, 3:30PM Location: Demo Theater, show floor location
  #1160 We will explore best practices to keep your clusters healthy and recover fast
  when things go wrong. Running etcd in production can be challenging with unexpected
  leader elections or network problems. Watch us demonstrate proven strategies for
  deploying and operating etcd at scale and share “rescue recipes” in action to address
  database bloat, instability, and failed upgrades. For those who want to get a head
  start or dive deeper before the event, we encourage you to explore our recent blog
  post: Kubernetes on VMware Cloud Foundation 9.0: A Single Platform for All Workloads.
  Join us at KubeCon + CloudNativeCon North America 2025 in Atlanta, connect with
  our engineers and maintainers at Booth #1010 , and be part of the conversations
  shaping the next decade of cloud native infrastructure.'
