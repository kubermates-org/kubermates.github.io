  🎉 Community & Engagement Highlights Your KubeCon Recap Reel 🤝 Stay Connected: Join
  the Calico Community! The Tigera team recently returned from KubeCon + CloudNativeCon
  North America and CalicoCon 2025 in Atlanta, Georgia. It was great, as always, to
  attend these events, feel the energy of our community, and hold in-depth discussions
  at the booth and in our dedicated sessions that revealed specific, critical shifts
  shaping the future of cloud-native platforms. We pulled together observations from
  our Tigera engineers and product experts in attendance to identify three key trends
  that are directly influencing how organizations manage Kubernetes today. A frequent
  and significant topic of conversation was the role of Kubernetes in supporting Artificial
  Intelligence and Machine Learning (AI/ML) infrastructure. The consensus is clear:
  Kubernetes is becoming the standard orchestration layer for these specialized workloads.
  This requires careful consideration of networking and security policies tailored
  to high-demand environments. Observations from the Tigera team indicated a consistent
  focus on positioning Kubernetes as the essential orchestration layer for AI workloads.
  This trend underscores the need for robust, high-performance CNI solutions designed
  for the future of specialized computing. Conversations pointed to a growing and
  tangible expansion of Kubernetes beyond central data centers and core clouds. Organizations
  are actively deploying lightweight clusters in highly distributed locations, or
  “the edge. ” This growth covers a wide variety of environments—from retail sites
  and branch offices to factory floors. Various discussions highlighted that Kubernetes
  at the edge is becoming popular.'
