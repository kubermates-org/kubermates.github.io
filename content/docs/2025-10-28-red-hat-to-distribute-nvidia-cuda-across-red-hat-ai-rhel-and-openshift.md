  Share For decades, Red Hat has been focused on providing the foundation for enterprise
  technology — a flexible, more consistent, and open platform. Today, as AI moves
  from a science experiment to a core business driver, that mission is more critical
  than ever. The challenge isn''t just about building AI models and AI-enabled applications;
  it’s about making sure the underlying infrastructure is ready to support them at
  scale, from the datacenter to the edge. This is why I''m so enthusiastic about the
  collaboration between Red Hat and NVIDIA. We''ve long worked together to bring our
  technologies to the open hybrid cloud, and our new agreement to distribute the NVIDIA
  CUDA Toolkit across the Red Hat portfolio is a testament to that collaboration.
  This isn''t just another collaboration; it''s about making it simpler for you to
  innovate with AI, no matter where you are on your journey. Today, one of the most
  significant barriers to AI adoption isn''t a lack of models or compute power, but
  rather the operational complexity of getting it all to work together. Engineers
  and data scientists shouldn''t have to spend their time managing dependencies, hunting
  for compatible drivers, or figuring out how to get their workloads running reliably
  on different systems. Our new agreement with NVIDIA addresses this head-on. By distributing
  the NVIDIA CUDA Toolkit directly within our platforms, we''re removing a major point
  of friction for developers and IT teams. You will be able to get the essential tools
  for GPU-accelerated computing from a single, trusted source. This means: A streamlined
  developer experience.'
