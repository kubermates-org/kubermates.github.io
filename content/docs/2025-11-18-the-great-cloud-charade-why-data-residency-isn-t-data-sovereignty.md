  73 - Next-Gen Data Services: The DBaaS Revolution with VCF 9 In the high-stakes
  world of digital infrastructure and modern sovereign cloud strategy, “sovereignty”
  has become the ultimate prize. Nations are drafting laws to control their digital
  territories. Enterprises are scrambling to comply, seeking cloud solutions that
  promise to keep sensitive data safe within jurisdictional lines. In response, hyperscalers
  have rolled out a red carpet of “sovereign” offerings for Europe — complete with
  local data centers, EU-resident staff, and billion-dollar investments. But a critical
  and often deliberately obscured distinction lies at the heart of this new landscape:
  the difference between data residency and data sovereignty. They are not the same.
  One is a feature linked to geography; the other is a control mechanism that defines
  autonomy. Understanding this difference is key to piercing the marketing veil —
  and recognizing that many so-called “sovereign public clouds” are, in fact, marketing-speak
  rather than true sovereign cloud compliance. Data Residency Vs. Data Sovereignty:
  The Core Distinction: Location vs. Customer Control To engage in a meaningful discussion,
  we must first establish clear definitions for these frequently conflated terms.
  Data Residency refers exclusively to the physical, geographic location where data
  is stored.'
