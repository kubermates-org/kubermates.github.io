  \ Access gpt-oss 20b and 120b directly on the Gradient AI Platform. Code + UI support:\
  \ Call the models through our Serverless Inference API or select them in the Gradient\
  \ dashboard when creating agents, or try them out in the model playground. Integrated\
  \ experience: Unified billing, observability, and traceability built into the platformâ\x80\
  \x94no need to stitch together multiple vendors, billing, or monitoring tools. With\
  \ code: Call the models directly through our Serverless Inference API. import os\
  \ import sys from gradient import Gradient model_access_key = os. environ. get(\
  \ \"GRADIENT_MODEL_ACCESS_KEY\" ) if not model_access_key: sys. stderr. write( \"\
  Error: GRADIENT_MODEL_ACCESS_KEY environment variable is not set. \\n \" ) sys."
