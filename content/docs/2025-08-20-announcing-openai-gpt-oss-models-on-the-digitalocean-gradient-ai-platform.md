summary: "By Grace Morgan OpenAIâ\x80\x99s first open-source GPT models (20b and 120b)\
  \ are now available on the Gradient AI Platform. This launch brings even more flexibility\
  \ and choice to developers building AI-powered applications, whether youâ\x80\x99\
  re starting with a quick prototype or scaling a production agent. With code: Call\
  \ the models directly through our Serverless Inference API. In the UI: Head to Agent\
  \ Creation and select gpt-oss 20b or 120b from the model dropdown. This launch marks\
  \ another step toward making Gradient AI Platform the simplest, most flexible way\
  \ to build real, production-ready AI applications. For code-first developers: ð\x9F\
  \x91\x89 Deploy gpt-oss via API: Spin up the 20b or 120b models directly through\
  \ the Gradient Serverless Inference API and start building in just a few lines of\
  \ code. For UI users: ð\x9F\x91\x89 Build with gpt-oss in console: Create an agent\
  \ in the Gradient AI Platform, select gpt-oss from the model dropdown, and deploy\
  \ instantlyâ\x80\x94no code required. Share Read more Read more Read more."
