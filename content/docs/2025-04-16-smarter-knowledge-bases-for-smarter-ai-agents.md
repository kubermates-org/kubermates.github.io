summary: "By Grace Morgan Weâ\x80\x99re rolling out new features to the GenAI Platform\
  \ that make it easier to build, manage, and improve the knowledge bases behind your\
  \ AI agents. With web crawling, custom crawling rules, and one-click reindexing,\
  \ you can keep your agents up to date with relevant, real-world information, without\
  \ manual data collection or external storage. Combined with recent enhancements\
  \ to our Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system, these updates can help your\
  \ AI agents deliver faster, more accurate, and more context-aware responses from\
  \ richer, better-organized data sources. The quality of your AI agent output depends\
  \ on the data it can access. With the new web crawling feature, you can crawl publicly\
  \ available websites and index content into your knowledge base , reducing the need\
  \ for manual data collection. This is especially valuable for AI agents that rely\
  \ on public web content to drive insights and actions. With web crawling, your AI\
  \ agent can stay informed by pulling in real-time information. To help your agents\
  \ make the most of that knowledge, weâ\x80\x99ve significantly upgraded our Retrieval-Augmented\
  \ Generation (RAG) system. These RAG enhancements help make your AI agents not just\
  \ smarter, but also more precise, transparent, and useful across a wide range of\
  \ real-world applications. Weâ\x80\x99ve also added Claude 3. 7 Sonnet to the GenAI\
  \ Platform, giving you access to Anthropicâ\x80\x99s latest and most advanced reasoning-focused\
  \ model. With an extended thinking mode for deeper analysis and more accurate answers\
  \ to complex queries, Claude 3."
