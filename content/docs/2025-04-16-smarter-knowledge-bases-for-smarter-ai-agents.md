  \x99re rolling out new features to the GenAI Platform that make it easier to build,\
  \ manage, and improve the knowledge bases behind your AI agents. With web crawling,\
  \ custom crawling rules, and one-click reindexing, you can keep your agents up to\
  \ date with relevant, real-world information, without manual data collection or\
  \ external storage. Combined with recent enhancements to our Retrieval-Augmented\
  \ Generation (RAG) system, these updates can help your AI agents deliver faster,\
  \ more accurate, and more context-aware responses from richer, better-organized\
  \ data sources. The quality of your AI agent output depends on the data it can access.\
  \ With the new web crawling feature, you can crawl publicly available websites and\
  \ index content into your knowledge base , reducing the need for manual data collection.\
  \ This is especially valuable for AI agents that rely on public web content to drive\
  \ insights and actions. Custom crawling rules let you target specific pages or entire\
  \ domains, ensuring your agent pulls data from the sites you tell it to. One-click\
  \ reindexing keeps your knowledge base fresh and up to date, making it ideal for\
  \ use cases like financial analysis and competitive research. No need for external\
  \ storage , since crawled content is directly integrated into your knowledge base,\
  \ simplifying setup and reducing overhead. With web crawling, your AI agent can\
  \ stay informed by pulling in real-time information. To help your agents make the\
  \ most of that knowledge, weâ\x80\x99ve significantly upgraded our Retrieval-Augmented\
  \ Generation (RAG) system."
