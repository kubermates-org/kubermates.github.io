  Share The path to modernization isn''t always the least distance between two points.
  As enterprises embrace containerization for speed and scalability, a significant
  number of business-critical workloads continue to run on virtual machines (VM).
  Managing these two distinct environments is complex enough as it is, but then there''s
  also disaster recovery. How do you ensure rapid, reliable recovery for both platforms
  without doubling complexity and cost? What if you could unify your virtualized and
  containerized workloads on a single, modern platform with a more consistent, effective
  strategy for backup and disaster recovery? Red Hat OpenShift Virtualization enables
  organizations to do just that. It''s an included feature of Red Hat OpenShift that
  allows you to run and manage VMs and containers on the same Kubernetes-based platform.
  This modern approach streamlines IT infrastructure, but it''s the ability to protect
  it that brings peace of mind. Commvault has long supported container backup and
  disaster recovery on Red Hat OpenShift. Now Commvault is extending its support for
  Red Hat OpenShift to include Red Hat OpenShift Virtualization so that the same unified
  platform now also protects VMs running alongside containers. Specifically Commvault
  Long-Term Support Release 11.40 and Commvault Innovation Release 11.42 will support
  the versions of OpenShift Virtualization that are part of Red Hat OpenShift Container
  Platform 4.18 and 4.19. For years, IT leaders have struggled with a fragmented approach
  to disaster recovery. Using separate backup tools for VMs and containers creates
  operational silos, increases the risk of data loss, and complicates recovery efforts
  when a disaster (such as a ransomware attack) occurs. With Commvault’s enterprise-grade
  data protection now extended to VMs running on Red Hat OpenShift Virtualization,
  you can finally implement a single, cohesive backup and recovery strategy.'
