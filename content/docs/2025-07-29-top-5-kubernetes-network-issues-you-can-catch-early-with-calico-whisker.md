summary: '1. Policy Misconfigurations 2. Misconfigured ServiceAccount Trust Boundaries
  3. Asymmetric or One-Sided Flow Patterns 4. Traffic to “Private Network” Destinations
  Without Explicit Source Policies 5. Zombie Connections and Stale Pod Traffic 🧠 Bonus:
  Why Whisker Stands Apart from Traditional Logs 🧪 Ready to Try It? Kubernetes networking
  is deceptively simple on the surface, until it breaks, silently leaks data, or opens
  the door to a full-cluster compromise. As modern workloads become more distributed
  and ephemeral, traditional logging and metrics just can’t keep up with the complexity
  of cloud-native traffic flows. That’s where Calico Whisker comes in. Whisker is
  a lightweight Kubernetes-native observability tool created by Tigera. It offers
  deep insights into real-time traffic flow patterns, without requiring you to deploy
  heavyweight service meshes or packet sniffer. And here’s something you won’t get
  anywhere else: Whisker is data plane-agnostic. Whether you run Calico eBPF data
  plane, nftables, or iptables, you’ll get the same high-fidelity flow logs with consistent
  fields, format, and visibility.'
