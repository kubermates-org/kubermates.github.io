tldr: Kubernetes networking is deceptively simple on the surface, until it breaks,
  silently leaks data, or opens the door to a full-cluster compromise. As modern workloads
  become more distributed and ephemeral, traditional logging and metrics just can’t
  keep up with the complexity of cloud-native traffic flows.
summary: 'Kubernetes networking is deceptively simple on the surface, until it breaks,
  silently leaks data, or opens the door to a full-cluster compromise. As modern workloads
  become more distributed and ephemeral, traditional logging and metrics just can’t
  keep up with the complexity of cloud-native traffic flows. That’s where Calico Whisker
  comes in. Whisker is a lightweight Kubernetes-native observability tool created
  by Tigera. It offers deep insights into real-time traffic flow patterns, without
  requiring you to deploy heavyweight service meshes or packet sniffer. And here’s
  something you won’t get anywhere else: Whisker is data plane-agnostic. Whether you
  run Calico eBPF data plane, nftables, or iptables, you’ll get the same high-fidelity
  flow logs with consistent fields, format, and visibility. You don’t have to change
  your data plane, Whisker fits right in and shows you the truth, everywhere. Let’s
  walk through 5 network issues Whisker helps you catch early, before they turn into
  outages or security incidents. Traditional observability tools often show whether
  a packet was forwarded, accepted or dropped, but not why. They lack visibility into
  which Kubernetes network policy was responsible or if one was even applied. With
  Whisker, each network flow is paired with: This lets you immediately spot: This
  makes it easy to answer questions like: You get proactive visibility into gaps in
  enforcement long before someone accidentally exposes an internal app to the public
  internet.'
