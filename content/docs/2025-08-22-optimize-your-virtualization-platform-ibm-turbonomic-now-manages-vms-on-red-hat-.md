  Virtualization Share With many businesses rethinking their reliance on their traditional
  virtualization platform, IT teams are looking for ways to manage costs without compromising
  performance or control. For organizations migrating VM workloads or running them
  side by side with containers, IBM Turbonomic and Red Hat OpenShift Virtualization
  now offer a unified, intelligent platform to optimize and enable innovation. The
  powerful new integration between IBM Turbonomic, a leader in application resource
  management (ARM) and Red Hat OpenShift Virtualization extends OpenShift by adding
  support for virtual machines (VMs) alongside containers. Powered by KubeVirt and
  the KVM hypervisor, OpenShift Virtualization lets you run, manage, and migrate Linux
  and Windows VMs. For organizations focused solely on virtualization, Red Hat also
  offers OpenShift Virtualization Engine , a dedicated edition of OpenShift that provides
  the same proven virtualization capabilities without the container platform and application
  development and delivery features found in the broader OpenShift platform. IBM Turbonomic
  already helps OpenShift users automatically manage and optimize container workloads.
  With this new integration, Turbonomic extends those same capabilities to VMs running
  on OpenShift Virtualization, providing teams with unified control of resource optimization
  across both VMs and containers in hybrid environments. IBM Turbonomic is a platform
  designed to manage and optimize application resources automatically. It continuously
  checks resource demands and provides clear recommendations and automated adjustments
  to keep applications running smoothly and efficiently. At its core, Turbonomic takes
  a unique application-centric approach to resource management. It automatically discovers
  your entire environment, from applications to infrastructure, and maps the dependencies
  between them. Using real-time analytics and AI-driven decision making, it determines
  the exact resources each application needs and takes action to ensure those needs
  are met.'
