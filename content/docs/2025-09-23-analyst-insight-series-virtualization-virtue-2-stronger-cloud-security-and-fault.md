  This blog is the second in our series on the benefits and trends of virtualization
  ( read the first blog here , and a companion to the 451 Research Business Impact
  Brief “ The virtues of virtualization. ” Securing infrastructure, applications and
  data has always been a tall order for IT, and it grows taller in modern distributed
  environments: attack vectors multiply as endpoints are added, and access and identity
  management becomes more complex. The inherent security enabled by virtualization
  is a key factor behind the staying power of virtual machines in today’s IT estates.
  VM isolation, network micro-segmentation and live migration allow operations teams
  to protect the environment and secure data while maintaining high availability.
  The scale and sophistication of cyberattacks has surged with growing internet connectivity
  and AI-driven automation: NIST’s National Vulnerability Database shows that in 2024,
  a record-breaking 40,009 new common vulnerabilities and exposures (CVEs) were discovered,
  up 38% from the prior year. 451 Research’s Voice of the Enterprise: Information
  Security, Budgets & Outlook 2024 survey reveals the impact on security teams, with
  cloud security, AI/ML implementation, GenAI, and data privacy cited as the top pain
  points. Not long ago, securing applications was seen as an afterthought, with controls
  applied after development and before deployment into production, but in today’s
  dynamic environments this is no longer sufficient. The key is to “shift left” and
  apply controls by default without losing up-to-the-minute availability of resources
  for developers. Virtualization accomplishes this by creating an isolated environment
  for each virtual machine, thereby reducing the attack surface, ideally with out-of-the-box
  configurations for protecting data, implementing hardening and security best practices,
  authenticating users (including non-human identities such as AI agents), and rotating
  certificates automatically. To ensure high availability, VMs benefit from redundancy—periodically
  saving snapshots in a remote location so configurations can be restored in case
  of an outage—and the ability to do live migration between physical hosts. Because
  virtualization defines machine characteristics in software, failover can be “designed
  in” to the environment to automatically recover without impacting the user experience.
  This advantage applies not only during emergencies but also when upgrading underlying
  hardware.'
