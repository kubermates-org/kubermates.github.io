  Share This series takes a look at the people and planning that went into building
  and releasing Red Hat Enterprise Linux 10. From the earliest conceptual stages to
  the launch at Red Hat Summit 2025, we’ll hear firsthand accounts of how RHEL 10
  came into being. Part 1 In our first post looking behind the scenes of how Red Hat
  Enterprise Linux (RHEL) 10 came to be. We heard about the early stages that started
  right after Summit 2022 and the release of RHEL 9. This included assembling the
  team, setting expectations, and working with upstream communities to gather ideas.
  In part 2, the team behind RHEL 10 shares how a new approach to building the platform
  came into focus and implementation. Brian Stinson, principal software engineer The
  first bit that we start with is Fedora. And that gives us the content set and problem
  space to look at. And then the things that we need to drive, that will happen continuously.
  Stef Walter, Senior Director, Engineering Part of what we did was have CentOS Stream
  be the place where we do RHEL development. A lot of it comes from Fedora, but then
  a lot of the iteration—constantly having a build, multiple times a day of all of
  RHEL—is in CentOS Stream. Stinson The main advantage we got out of doing [CentOS
  Stream] was we were basically doing the build in public, and it actually helped
  us quite a bit just keeping some of that engagement.'
