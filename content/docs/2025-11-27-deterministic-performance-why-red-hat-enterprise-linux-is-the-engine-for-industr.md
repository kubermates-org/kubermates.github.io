  Share In industrial environments, the drive toward smart manufacturing means blending
  the worlds of operational technology (OT) and information technology (IT). To this
  point, these worlds have existed in silos—OT managing the physical, real-time control
  of machinery, and IT focusing on data, security, and enterprise efficiency. But
  today, the industrial edge depends on this convergence. This unification demands
  a reliable platform that provides low latency as well as predictable latency—what
  we call deterministic performance. Determinism means that a high-priority task,
  like motion control or robotic coordination, always executes within a guaranteed
  timeframe, regardless of system load. Without it, unpredictable delays of even milliseconds
  can be a recipe for disaster. Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) delivers this tested
  real-time, deterministic performance required for next-generation industrial applications
  and control workloads. And we can prove it. In the following sections, I’ll dive
  into the performance data from our bare-metal and real-world "screw-to-screw" round-trip
  tests to clearly show how RHEL consistently maintains the sub-millisecond determinism
  you need. Authors note: For the purpose of this discussion, all performance data
  outlined for RHEL will also apply to Red Hat Device Edge , built from RHEL and providing
  the same core capabilities for resource-constrained devices—especially important
  in the industrial space Before we jump into performance data, let me set some context.
  When we talk about performance in manufacturing, we’re not just talking about speed.
  We’re talking about determinism.'
