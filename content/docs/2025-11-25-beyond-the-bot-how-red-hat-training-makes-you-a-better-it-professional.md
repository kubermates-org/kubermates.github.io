  Applications Virtualization Share Picture this: You''re working late to troubleshoot
  a production issue and an AI assistant suggests a fix in seconds. Problem solved,
  right? Not quite. While it seems like it should be easy to use AI assistance, where
  do you start? What''s your prompt? How do you find the issue within the system?
  AI tools and other large language models are transforming our daily workflows, helping
  with everything from debugging scripts to generating boilerplate code in seconds,
  but you still have to know how (and when) to use them. This raises a valid question
  for many IT practitioners—with so much knowledge at your fingertips, is a guided
  training and certification path still necessary? At Red Hat, our answer is an emphatic
  yes. The most successful IT professionals understand that this isn’t an either/or
  scenario. The key isn''t to choose between AI and guided training, but to master
  the powerful synergy between them. Think of it as a hybrid approach—use AI as a
  scalable, always-available companion, while building your authoritative and validated
  expertise with Red Hat Training. The true value of AI in software development lies
  in its ability to dramatically speed up engineering workflows. These tools efficiently
  handle low-level, high-volume tasks, making it possible for IT teams to move faster,
  experiment more, and manage complexity more effectively. AI tools are fantastic
  for: Quick lookups : Need to remember the syntax for a specific Ansible playbook
  command? An AI code assistant can provide it instantly. Rapid experimentation :
  You can quickly iterate with different command options or code snippets without
  the overhead of setting up a full environment. Translating code and logic across
  languages : If you need to integrate a function from an older Python service into
  a new Go application, an AI assistant can quickly convert the logic.'
