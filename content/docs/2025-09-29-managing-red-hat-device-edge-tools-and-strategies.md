  Infrastructure Applications Virtualization Share Aligning system management, automation,
  and application lifecycle with your edge strategy In part 1 of this two-part blog
  series, we introduced the decision framework for Red Hat Device Edge , when it makes
  sense compared to Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) or Red Hat OpenShift , and the
  unique role of MicroShift in enabling Kubernetes at the edge. In this article, you’ll
  learn how to manage the system that you’ve chosen for your edge strategy. Once you’ve
  selected Red Hat Device Edge, the next step is designing a management approach that
  matches your deployment model, team expertise, and operational requirements. We’ll
  explore: The trade-offs between package-based and image-based Red Hat Device Edge
  deployments. How Red Hat Satellite, Red Hat Ansible Automation Platform, and Red
  Hat Advanced Cluster Management for Kubernetes fit into the picture. The future
  of large-scale image-based management with Red Hat Edge Manager. Application lifecycle
  management options for MicroShift in both package-based and image-based environments.
  By the end of this article, you’ll have a clear understanding of the management
  strategies available for Red Hat Device Edge and how to align them with your edge
  computing goals. Red Hat Device Edge is built with RHEL, allowing you to confidently
  take advantage of familiar management tools. The primary differentiator is MicroShift
  support, which introduces additional considerations for container orchestration
  alongside traditional system management. Red Hat provides several products for scale
  management, but the optimal selection depends on your deployment approach, particularly
  whether you choose package-based or image-based RHEL deployments (both are supported
  with Red Hat Device Edge). The choice between using package-based or image-based
  (bootc) RHEL is a topic of its own and falls outside the scope of this article.'
