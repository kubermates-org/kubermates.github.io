  Applications Virtualization Share Red Hat Ansible Automation Platform 2.6 introduces
  powerful capabilities for managing, scaling, and deploying automation across your
  enterprise. Whether you''re a new user planning your first deployment or an existing
  customer upgrading from a previous version, understanding the available installation
  and upgrade methods is critical. This guide provides a high-level overview of the
  supported paths to Ansible Automation Platform 2.6. Ansible Automation Platform
  offers flexible installation methods to suit your infrastructure, with support for
  deployments on Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) and Red Hat OpenShift. On RHEL, there
  are two primary methods for deploying Ansible Automation Platform, though one of
  the options is deprecated. Containerized installations are the recommended approach
  for new installations and deployments on RHEL. The Ansible Automation Platform 2.6
  containerized installer requires either RHEL 9 or RHEL 10. Read the documentation
  to learn more. The Ansible Automation Platform 2.6 RPM-based install is only available
  on RHEL 9. We suggest using the RHEL RPM install method only for specific upgrade
  scenarios, not for net new installations. Read the documentation to learn more.
  When we released Ansible Automation Platform 2.5, we announced that the RPM install
  method was being deprecated.'
