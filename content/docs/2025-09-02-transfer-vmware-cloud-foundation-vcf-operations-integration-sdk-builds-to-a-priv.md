  VMware Cloud Foundation (VCF) Operations offers comprehensive IT management, focusing
  on proactive operations and security. It monitors, manages, and optimizes IT operations
  by collecting data using management packs. VCF Operations includes built-in packs
  for components like vCenter and VCF. Additionally, it provides tools—a management
  pack builder and an Integration SDK—that enable users to develop custom management
  packs for monitoring applications and infrastructure components not covered by the
  built-in options. These user-developed management packs can be uploaded and deployed
  to specific environments, allowing organizations to tailor their monitoring capabilities
  and integrate diverse technologies within their VCF ecosystem. The Integration SDK
  provides tools and libraries in Python and Java to aid in development of management
  packs to add custom objects, data, and relationships from an endpoint into VCF Operations.
  The Integration SDK generates containerized management packs and hence requires
  a container registry for its storage and retrieval. This container registry must
  be accessible by the VCF Operations Cloud Proxies to download the container. By
  default, the Integration SDK’s build environment’s container registry must be accessible
  by the VCF Operations Cloud proxies in the intended deployment environment. In most
  scenarios, the container registry used by the Integration SDK’s build environment
  is accessible by the VCF Operations Cloud Proxies in the deployed environment. However,
  in the following situations, Integration SDKs build environment’s container registry
  may not be accessible by the VCF Operations Cloud proxies in the intended deployment
  environment: VCF Operations has been deployed in an air-gapped environment and there
  is no connectivity to the internet to access public container registry. The VCF
  Operations Integration SDK’s build environment has used a private container registry
  and there is no connectivity from the customer’s infrastructure to this private
  container registry.'
