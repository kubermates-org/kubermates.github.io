summary: 'Securing Your Infrastructure as Code: The Power of Nirmata and HashiCorp
  Terraform HashiCorp Terraform: The Foundation of Your Infrastructure Nirmata: The
  Governance & Security Layer A Practical Synergy HashiCorp Terraform is synonymous
  with Infrastructure as Code (IaC) and is heavily used for infrastructure provisioning,
  but often, cloud resources are misconfigured. Also, with the rapid adoption of AI,
  more IaC is being generated using AI tools. The challenge is to identify misconfigurations
  early, ensuring that provisioned infrastructure is secure and reliable. At Nirmata,
  we believe that empowering developers with agile, self-service tools is crucial,
  but it must be done with guardrails in place. This is where the powerful combination
  of Nirmata and Terraform comes into play. While Terraform is the industry standard
  for declaring and provisioning infrastructure, Nirmata provides the essential governance,
  security, and lifecycle management for that infrastructure and the applications
  running on it. Terraform, as the leader in Infrastructure as Code (IaC), allows
  you to define your cloud and on-premises resources in a declarative, human-readable
  language. With a vast ecosystem of providers, including a Nirmata provider , you
  can use Terraform to provision everything from a simple virtual machine to a complex,
  multi-cluster Kubernetes environment on any cloud, like AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud
  Platform (GCP). The core benefit is clear: you manage your infrastructure in a predictable,
  repeatable, and version-controlled way. While Terraform is ideal for provisioning,
  it falls short in addressing the ongoing challenges of Day 2 operations, security,
  and governance. This is where Nirmata’s policy-based platform complements your Terraform
  workflows. Think of it this way: Terraform is your blueprint for provisioning infrastructure
  across any provider and any cloud.'
