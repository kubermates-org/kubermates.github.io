tldr: Kubernetes v1. 34 is coming at the end of August 2025.
summary: Kubernetes v1. 34 is coming at the end of August 2025. This release will
  not include any removal or deprecation, but it is packed with an impressive number
  of enhancements. Here are some of the features we are most excited about in this
  cycle! Please note that this information reflects the current state of v1. 34 development
  and may change before release. The following list highlights some of the notable
  enhancements likely to be included in the v1. 34 release, but is not an exhaustive
  list of all planned changes. This is not a commitment and the release content is
  subject to change. Dynamic Resource Allocation (DRA) provides a flexible way to
  categorize, request, and use devices like GPUs or custom hardware in your Kubernetes
  cluster. Since the v1. 30 release, DRA has been based around claiming devices using
  structured parameters that are opaque to the core of Kubernetes. The relevant enhancement
  proposal, KEP-4381 , took inspiration from dynamic provisioning for storage volumes.
