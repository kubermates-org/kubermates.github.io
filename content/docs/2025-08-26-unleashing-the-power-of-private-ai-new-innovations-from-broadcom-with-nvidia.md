summary: Enterprises can get tremendous productivity and business transformation from
  AI. With VMware Private AI Foundation with NVIDIA , Broadcom and NVIDIA aim to unlock
  AI and unleash productivity with lower TCO. Recently with VCF 9. 0 , Broadcom and
  NVIDIA released several features in VMware Private AI Foundation with NVIDIA to
  further our mission of providing private and secure AI models for enterprises. Today
  we are happy to announce additional capabilities to help enterprises in this mission.
  Previously sold separately, VCF will now include VCF Private AI services as part
  of the platform. Private AI services enable privacy and security, simplify infrastructure
  management and streamline model deployment. They include capabilities such as GPU
  Monitoring, Model Store, Model Runtime, Agent Builder, Vector Database and Data
  Indexing and Retrieval. By embedding all the benefits of Private AI into VMware
  Cloud Foundation, enterprises will get a unified platform for their AI and non-AI
  workloads without an additional purchase. We are releasing an exciting new capability
  in the platform. NVIDIA Blackwell GPUs unlock the potential of generative, agentic
  and physical AI by delivering exceptional performance, efficiency and scale for
  enterprises. VCF will now support the NVIDIA Blackwell architecture, enabling enterprises
  to get the industry-leading AI training and inference capabilities at unprecedented
  scale.
