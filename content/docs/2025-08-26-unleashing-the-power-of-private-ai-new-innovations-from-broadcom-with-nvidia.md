  Building your GenAI Agents on VCF with Private AI Services Enterprises can get tremendous
  productivity and business transformation from AI. With VMware Private AI Foundation
  with NVIDIA , Broadcom and NVIDIA aim to unlock AI and unleash productivity with
  lower TCO. Recently with VCF 9.0 , Broadcom and NVIDIA released several features
  in VMware Private AI Foundation with NVIDIA to further our mission of providing
  private and secure AI models for enterprises. Today we are happy to announce additional
  capabilities to help enterprises in this mission. Previously sold separately, VCF
  will now include VCF Private AI services as part of the platform. Private AI services
  enable privacy and security, simplify infrastructure management and streamline model
  deployment. They include capabilities such as GPU Monitoring, Model Store, Model
  Runtime, Agent Builder, Vector Database and Data Indexing and Retrieval. By embedding
  all the benefits of Private AI into VMware Cloud Foundation, enterprises will get
  a unified platform for their AI and non-AI workloads without an additional purchase.
  We are releasing an exciting new capability in the platform. NVIDIA Blackwell GPUs
  unlock the potential of generative, agentic and physical AI by delivering exceptional
  performance, efficiency and scale for enterprises. VCF will now support the NVIDIA
  Blackwell architecture, enabling enterprises to get the industry-leading AI training
  and inference capabilities at unprecedented scale. Let’s look at the supported GPUs.
