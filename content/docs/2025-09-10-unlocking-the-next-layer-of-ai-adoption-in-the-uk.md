  Infrastructure Applications Virtualization Share Red Hat has formed a collaboration
  with Great Wave AI to make AI more usable for organisations of all sizes. Red Hat
  has a bold vision to help enterprises bridge their existing world and the new world
  of AI: supporting any model, on any accelerator, on any cloud, powered by open source.
  At this year’s Red Hat Summit , we made dozens of announcements extending our AI
  portfolio and ecosystem partnerships. Since then, we are excited to have formed
  a collaboration with Great Wave AI, a UK-based provider of an agentic generative
  AI (gen AI) platform. Together we aim to combine the scale, security features and
  flexibility of Red Hat AI with Great Wave’s “consumption layer” for multi-agent
  orchestration, making AI more usable for organisations of all sizes. This collaboration
  provides Red Hat customers with the ability to add an agentic layer on top of our
  enterprise-ready open source AI platforms, making it easier for them to tailor AI
  capabilities to their organization. Why AI orchestration? I recently had the opportunity
  to catch up with Jack Perschke, co-founder and chief executive officer of Great
  Wave AI, and discuss some of the trends shaping AI at the moment and what the collaboration
  means for both our companies. According to Jack, large language models (LLMs) are
  “like crude oil” in that they’re valuable, but need refinement to become usable
  products. Great Wave acts as the refinery turning raw model capability into fit-for-purpose
  tools, using their choice of hosting provider or LLM vendor. Jack explains, “Our
  platform makes it easier to switch between models, test applications with new models
  and host your own to meet specific security needs. In an era where prompts and responses
  can’t be encrypted inside the model itself, the safest option is often running it
  in your own environment. Red Hat makes this possible.'
