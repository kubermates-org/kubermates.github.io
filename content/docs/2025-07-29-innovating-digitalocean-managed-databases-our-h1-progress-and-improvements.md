  \ read Databases are the cornerstone of modern applications, and at DigitalOcean,\
  \ weâ\x80\x99re committed to providing you with powerful, scalable, and easy-to-use\
  \ managed database solutions. The first half of 2025 has been a busy and exciting\
  \ time for our Managed Databases team, as weâ\x80\x99ve rolled out a series of significant\
  \ new features and engines designed to enhance your development experience. From\
  \ expanding support for popular database versions to introducing advanced observability\
  \ tools, weâ\x80\x99ve been focused on delivering the innovations you need to build\
  \ and scale with confidence. In chronological order, letâ\x80\x99s take a look at\
  \ some of the key launches and improvements weâ\x80\x99ve made within the first\
  \ half of the 2025 fiscal year [H1]. Launched February 11, support for PostgreSQL\
  \ 17 offers improved performance, expanded developer tools, enhanced high availability\
  \ and replication, and advanced security and monitoring capabilities. To read more\
  \ about all of the new features, such as indexing improvements and expanding monitoring\
  \ and analysis tools, check out our blog post from this past February. Continuing\
  \ the theme of database upgrades, as of March 13, DigitalOcean Managed MongoDB supports\
  \ MongoDB v8 (8.0.12). This latest release brings significant improvements in performance,\
  \ scalability, and security, including faster replication through improved concurrent\
  \ writes, optimized time-series data handling, and enhanced client-side encryption\
  \ with support for range queries. Developers also gain greater control over performance\
  \ with features like persistent query settings and default maximum execution times.\
  \ To learn more about this release and our Managed MongoDB service, check out our\
  \ blog or visit the MongoDB homepage. Both Managed MySQL and PostgreSQL have doubled\
  \ the amount of storage they support, with MySQL now supporting up to 20TB and PostgreSQL\
  \ supporting up to 30TB. As of March 19, these expanded storage options are currently\
  \ available in Singapore (SGP1), San Francisco (SFO2), Toronto (TOR1), New York\
  \ City (NYC2, NYC3), and Frankfurt (FRA1), with more regions to come."
