summary: "By Nicole Ghalwash Databases are the cornerstone of modern applications,\
  \ and at DigitalOcean, weâ\x80\x99re committed to providing you with powerful, scalable,\
  \ and easy-to-use managed database solutions. The first half of 2025 has been a\
  \ busy and exciting time for our Managed Databases team, as weâ\x80\x99ve rolled\
  \ out a series of significant new features and engines designed to enhance your\
  \ development experience. From expanding support for popular database versions to\
  \ introducing advanced observability tools, weâ\x80\x99ve been focused on delivering\
  \ the innovations you need to build and scale with confidence. In chronological\
  \ order, letâ\x80\x99s take a look at some of the key launches and improvements\
  \ weâ\x80\x99ve made within the first half of the 2025 fiscal year [H1]. Launched\
  \ February 11, support for PostgreSQL 17 offers improved performance, expanded developer\
  \ tools, enhanced high availability and replication, and advanced security and monitoring\
  \ capabilities. To read more about all of the new features, such as indexing improvements\
  \ and expanding monitoring and analysis tools, check out our blog post from this\
  \ past February. Continuing the theme of database upgrades, as of March 13, DigitalOcean\
  \ Managed MongoDB supports MongoDB v8 (8. 0. 12). This latest release brings significant\
  \ improvements in performance, scalability, and security, including faster replication\
  \ through improved concurrent writes, optimized time-series data handling, and enhanced\
  \ client-side encryption with support for range queries. Developers also gain greater\
  \ control over performance with features like persistent query settings and default\
  \ maximum execution times. To learn more about this release and our Managed MongoDB\
  \ service, check out our blog or visit the MongoDB homepage."
