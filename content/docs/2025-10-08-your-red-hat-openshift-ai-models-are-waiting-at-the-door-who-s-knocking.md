  Applications Virtualization Share You’ve trained the model, packaged it on Red Hat
  OpenShift AI, and it’s ready to work. The next move is exposing it through an API
  so people and applications can use it. At that moment, your model stops being an
  internal experiment and becomes a front-door service. And like any front door, somebody
  is going to knock … sometimes it’s the right user, sometimes not. Your model is
  no longer just a project in a lab: it’s a production endpoint. And like any endpoint,
  it’s a target. How do you ensure that only the right applications and users are
  interacting with it? How do you protect the sensitive data it might be trained on
  or the proprietary logic it contains? Every API endpoint is a target. For AI models,
  the attack surface is bigger than a simple app service. Beyond simple denial-of-service
  traffic, models can be tricked into leaking data through prompt injection, or probed
  until sensitive training data shows up. Even when no data leaks, attackers may try
  to hijack compute cycles or scrape responses in bulk. As deployments spread across
  clouds, datacenters, and edge sites, these risks multiply.'
