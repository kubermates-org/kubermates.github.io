  \ you down. The DigitalOcean Gradientâ\x84¢ AI Platform is evolving to tackle these\
  \ challenges, helping you work smarter, faster, and more confidently. This month,\
  \ weâ\x80\x99re introducing four new updates designed to make AI development more\
  \ transparent, productive, and secure: Knowledge base activity logs: track and debug\
  \ indexing jobs â\x86\x92 Knowledge base activity logs: track and debug indexing\
  \ jobs â\x86\x92 Agent templates: start projects faster â\x86\x92 Agent templates:\
  \ start projects faster â\x86\x92 n8n integration: automate workflows â\x86\x92\
  \ n8n integration: automate workflows â\x86\x92 Enhanced guardrails: make AI safer\
  \ â\x86\x92 Enhanced guardrails: make AI safer â\x86\x92 When you add data to a\
  \ knowledge base, it isnâ\x80\x99t always clear whatâ\x80\x99s happening behind\
  \ the scenes. Did the indexing job finish? Did certain files fail to index? Why\
  \ isnâ\x80\x99t the data showing up in the knowledge base? Until now, debugging\
  \ knowledge base inputs meant guesswork. Activity logs give you clear visibility\
  \ into every run, so you always know what worked, what failed, and why. Real-time\
  \ banners for active jobs Real-time banners for active jobs History view to review\
  \ past runs History view to review past runs CSV downloads with per-source error\
  \ details CSV downloads with per-source error details With this update, you can\
  \ quickly pinpoint issues, fix them, and be confident about your knowledge base\
  \ without slogging through trial and error. Explore Activity Logs â\x86\x92 Why\
  \ start from scratch when you can start from a working agent? Agent templates are\
  \ code-first projects available on GitHub that you can clone, customize, and deploy\
  \ in minutes. llm-Auditor Agent: Adds fact-checking using Tavily, an AI tool that\
  \ verifies answers for accuracy, with optional knowledge base grounding. Product\
  \ Documentation Agent: Transforms product documentation into object storage, builds\
  \ and indexes a knowledge base, deploys a citation-rich answering agent, and optimizes\
  \ it for high RAG performance as a support chatbot. SQL Agent: Translates natural\
  \ language into safe, read-only SQL queries. Twilio API Agent: Sends marketing texts\
  \ via Twilio with ready-made logic."
