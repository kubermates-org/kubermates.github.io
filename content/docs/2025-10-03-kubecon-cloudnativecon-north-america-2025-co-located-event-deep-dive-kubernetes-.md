  community! Posted on October 3, 2025 by Co-chairs, Katerina Arzhayev, Gergely Csat√°ri,
  and Mars Toktonaliev CNCF projects highlighted in this post The inaugural Edge Day
  launched as a co-located event at KubeCon + CloudNativeCon EU in 2022, recognizing
  that data at the edge is here to stay. Once called the ‚ÄòInternet of Things‚Äô and
  later ‚ÄòIndustry 4.0,‚Äô today ‚Äòedge computing‚Äô has emerged as the unifying term, reflecting
  the evolution from centralized data centers and cloud computing to the very edge
  of the network. Kubernetes on Edge Day embraces this shift with a thoughtful agenda
  that brings together academic research, real-world enterprise use cases, and insights
  from peers across the Kubernetes community. This is a wonderful event for everyone
  who wants to get as close to the newest technology as they can, without going to
  a quantum computing conference üòä. Engineers working at large companies who are looking
  to modernize and containerize their applications will be able to explore real-world
  business applications of technological innovation. Students and researchers will
  hear from other academics on what and how they are doing to push the limits of what
  is typically thought to be possible. At Kubernetes on Edge Day, we bring together
  experts for an audience who are tackling some of the most exciting and complex problems
  in cloud computin today, and tomorrow. We did our best to limit the topics to stay
  as close to true ‚Äúedge computing‚Äù as we could, but the reality is edge computing
  is the future that is leaking into all other categories, verticals, industries,
  and technologies. This year, we had submissions covering artificial intelligence
  at the edge, edge computing for telco deployments, the effect and importance of
  data on Kubernetes, the vitality of observability at scale for these systems, and
  many more. We hope that this year‚Äôs agenda tells an interesting story about Kubernetes
  at the Edge. The event will kick off in the main room with a welcome from the chairs.
  After that, we‚Äôll dive straight into the featured sessions.
