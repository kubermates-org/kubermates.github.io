  Good day, everyone 👋 Welcome to the first episode of the APAC edition of the “Meet
  Our Contributors” blog post series. In this post, we’ll introduce you to five amazing
  folks from the India region who have been actively contributing to the upstream
  Kubernetes projects in a variety of ways, as well as being the leaders or maintainers
  of numerous community initiatives. 💫 Let’s get started, so without further ado…
  Arsh is currently employed with Okteto as a Developer Experience engineer. As a
  new contributor, he realised that 1:1 mentorship opportunities were quite beneficial
  in getting him started with the upstream project. He is presently a CI Signal shadow
  on the Kubernetes 1. 23 release team. He is also contributing to the SIG Testing
  and SIG Docs projects, as well as to the cert-manager tools development work that
  is being done under the aegis of SIG Architecture. To the newcomers, Arsh helps
  plan their early contributions sustainably. I would encourage folks to contribute
  in a way that’s sustainable. What I mean by that is that it’s easy to be very enthusiastic
  early on and take up more stuff than one can actually handle. This can often lead
  to burnout in later stages. It’s much more sustainable to work on things iteratively.'
