  Virtualization virtue #3: Supporting application modernization With the rise of
  AI, hybrid cloud environments, and digital transformation initiatives, IT infrastructure
  is under unprecedented pressure. For IT leaders and enterprise architects, the challenge
  isn’t just about keeping up—it’s about making strategic, forward-looking decisions
  while continuing to leverage existing technology investments. In a new paper “ Future-Proofing
  IT Infrastructure: A Decision Framework for Enterprise Architects ” HyperFRAME Research
  provides a structured rubric grounded in operational reality to guide this crucial
  evolution. The framework outlines eight pragmatic steps for infrastructure modernization:
  Inventory the Current Infrastructure: A successful modernization effort begins by
  establishing a clear baseline-—a complete picture of existing workloads, deployment
  patterns, and supporting platforms. This avoids the risk of investing in the wrong
  solutions. Evaluate Organizational Structure and Team Skillsets: Technology is only
  as good as the people and processes that support it. Organizations need to rigorously
  assess their team’s skills and knowledge gaps, and the cost and time required to
  bridge them. Determine Non-Functional Requirements (NFRs): While functional requirements
  define what a system does, NFRs—such as performance, scalability, and resilience—dictate
  how it operates under pressure. Evaluating infrastructure choices with NFRs in mind
  is essential for ensuring systems can meet business demands. Compare Virtualization
  and Containerization Options: With a clear understanding of the current environment,
  team capabilities, and business needs, organizations can determine which compute
  model best aligns with workload demands and long-term objectives. Evaluate Platform
  Capabilities and Integration: The enterprise IT environment is complex, with a myriad
  of individual infrastructure components. Managing it effectively requires a platform
  that orchestrates these different components into a cohesive, integrated whole,
  delivering simplicity with agility and flexibility.'
