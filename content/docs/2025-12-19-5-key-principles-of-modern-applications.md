  Episode 76: Cloud Admin Fast Track – Learn Infrastructure as Code the Easy Way with
  VCF 9.0 In a recent panel discussion titled “Top 5 Criteria to Choose the Right
  Platform for Your Modern Workloads,” members from the VMware Cloud Foundation (VCF)
  team and Forrester analyst Brent Ellis explored how enterprises evaluate infrastructure
  platforms for modern, hybrid workloads. The conversation focused on five priorities:
  security and resilience, scalability, operational simplicity, developer enablement,
  and innovation. Forrester’s Ellis emphasized that organizations are seeking standardization
  in platform engineering, with platforms treating VMs and Kubernetes workloads equally.
  This is a core design principle of VMware Cloud Foundation 9.0. This discussion
  laid the groundwork for why platform choices matter, especially for private clouds.
  Let’s now dive deeper into five key principles for successfully designing and operating
  modern applications, using best practices from NIST, CNCF, Google SRE, and ITIL.
  Modern applications are no longer confined to virtual machines, containers, or cloud
  accounts.'
