  by channel Automation Artificial intelligence Open hybrid cloud Security Edge computing
  Infrastructure Applications Virtualization Share Artificial intelligence (AI) is
  rapidly moving from a theoretical concept to a central engine of enterprise value,
  transforming sectors from healthcare to finance. The capacity of AI to analyze,
  predict, and automate makes it an indispensable asset for modern innovation. Yet,
  this widespread adoption introduces a significant security imperative: as AI workloads
  scale, so does the risk of unauthorized access to proprietary AI models and the
  sensitive data they handle. These AI models are significant assets for organizations,
  representing substantial investments in research, training, and inferencing. Protecting
  them requires a robust security strategy that goes beyond traditional measures for
  data at rest (in storage) and in transit (over networks). The most vulnerable state
  is data in use, the moment it''s actively being processed in memory. This is where
  confidential computing emerges as a game-changer. By providing a trusted execution
  environment (TEE), it strengthens application security through isolation, encryption,
  and attestation, protecting data and code as they are being used. This approach
  enables a comprehensive defense-in-depth strategy, which is crucial for regulated
  industries handling sensitive information. By integrating these security features
  with a scalable, high-performance AI and machine learning (ML) ecosystem, companies
  can leverage AI with confidence, without sacrificing security for speed. In this
  blog, we will explore the usage of Red Hat OpenShift confidential containers along
  with NVIDIA confidential GPUs to protect AI workloads, focusing on Red Hat AI Inference
  Server as the workload. Confidential containers (CoCo) are a cloud-native implementation
  of confidential computing that brings the security of a TEE to a standard containerized
  workload (such as Intel TDX or AMD SEV-SNP).'
