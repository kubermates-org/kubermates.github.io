  is a continuous journey for enterprises, driven by the need for greater business
  agility, enhanced security, and cost optimization. While the benefits are clear,
  large-scale modernization projects can be complex, time-consuming, and require significant
  upfront investment. With the introduction of migration toolkit for applications
  8 (MTA 8), Red Hat is helping organizations overcome these challenges by automating
  key parts of the modernization journey. The migration toolkit for applications has
  long provided tools for containerization readiness, source-code analysis, and project
  management. MTA 8 builds on this foundation by introducing two major new capabilities:
  automated replatforming and intelligent refactoring. Replatforming—migrating an
  application from one platform to another with minimal code changes—is a common modernization
  strategy that can deliver significant benefits like improved scalability, security,
  and cost-efficiency. However, even this approach can be time-consuming due to a
  number of manual, error-prone tasks. MTA 8 automates this process by generating
  the necessary deployment artifacts to run an application on Red Hat OpenShift. The
  first supported migration path is from Cloud Foundry to OpenShift, enabling users
  to: Discover and analyze applications: MTA connects to the source platform to identify
  applications and extract crucial deployment and runtime information. Generate deployment
  assets: Using this normalized data, MTA translates the configuration into the target
  platform format by leveraging Helm Charts to create deployment manifests for OpenShift.
  Streamline deployment: The resulting artifacts are automatically placed in a target
  repository, which can be picked up by CI/CD pipelines for automated deployment.
  This automation helps to reduce manual work and improve the ROI of application modernization
  projects.'
