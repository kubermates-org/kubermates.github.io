  Cloud Foundation with Ubuntu OS - Smarter Choice for Modern Apps We’re excited to
  announce the General Availability of Holodeck 9.0.1.0, building upon the success
  of Holodeck 9.0 to further empower your teams in deploying standardized and automated
  nested VMware Cloud Foundation (VCF) environments! A sincere thank you from the

  the engagement and feedback. It’s helped us further shape and grow the tool! In
  today’s fast-paced technological landscape, the ability to rapidly and reliably
  test new technical capabilities is paramount. While deploying nested VCF environments
  has always been possible, it often involves time-consuming manual configurations
  and significant hardware overhead. Holodeck continues to change the game by providing
  a self-contained, automated, and repeatable solution that dramatically reduces complexity
  and resource requirements, now with even more robust features. Some highlights:
  New-HoloDeckConfig: This cmdlet now validates the integrity of the config. json
  template. If the template file’s integrity does not match, the user will see a warning
  before a new config file is created for the Holodeck instance. Ideally, users are
  not expected to modify the template config file; however, there may be edge cases
  where a customer chooses to do so. In such cases, the warning ensures they are informed
  of the change. Remove-HoloDeckInstance: This cmdlet has a new optional parameter
  to support the automated deletion of the holodeck instance. If not specified, then
  the instance ID will be captured from the global config file. Also, the prompt for
  user confirmation is removed, instead, the user will have 15 seconds to abort the
  operation by pressing any key on the console.'
