  Share If you''re building on Red Hat OpenShift , then your mission is likely the
  same as countless systems administrators: Provide a consistent, reliable application
  platform that spans from your data center to the public cloud. But as many platform
  teams have discovered, that seamless hybrid vision often runs into the practical
  hurdle of storage. Managing persistent storage for stateful apps introduces complexity,
  especially when your clusters span on-premises infrastructure and cloud environments
  like Red Hat OpenShift Service on AWS (ROSA). Different environments can mean different
  tooling, different processes, and more friction than you''d like. What if you could
  cut through that? What if your storage layer worked the same everywhere, managed
  natively inside OpenShift, without extra operational overhead? That''s not a future
  state anymore. It''s here, thanks to NetApp''s certified Red Hat OpenShift operator
  for Trident. You might already know Trident, NetApp''s dynamic CSI provisioner for
  Kubernetes. It brings NetApp''s ONTAP, a unified data infrastructure featuring snapshots,
  clones, replication, and more, to containerized workloads. The certified OpenShift
  operator takes a step further. The NetApp Trident Operator is a controller that
  automates the entire lifecycle of the Trident CSI driver to provide persistent storage
  from NetApp systems.'
