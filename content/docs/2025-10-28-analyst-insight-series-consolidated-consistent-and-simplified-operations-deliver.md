  This blog is the second in our series, “Effective Platform Engineering: Priorities,
  Pitfalls and Success in Taming Complexity and Managing Today’s Enterprise Infrastructure
  and Applications. ”(read the first blog here ) and a companion to the analyst report,
  “ Cost, Productivity, Security Shape Today’s Platform Engineering ” To implement
  effective platform engineering, enterprise teams must address significant challenges
  related to complexity and integration across infrastructures, applications, tools
  and teams. Key to overcoming these challenges are consolidated, consistent and simplified
  operations that enhance developer productivity, increase cost efficiency, and improve
  quality and security. Tackling integration and complexity IT teams commonly cite
  integration and complexity as hurdles to effective platform engineering and DevOps,
  as highlighted in our Voice of the Enterprise survey (see figure below). Challenges
  in adopting platform engineering Q. What challenges, if any, do you expect (or have
  you encountered) in adopting platform engineering? (Select top 3). Base: Respondents
  whose organizations have platform engineering initiatives. Source: 451 Research’s
  Voice of the Enterprise: Cloud Native, Platform Engineering 2024. Simplified operations
  focused on unified lifecycle management can help reduce the complexity of modern
  enterprise infrastructure and applications, including rapidly evolving tools and
  platforms such as Kubernetes. While Kubernetes promises effective management of
  applications and infrastructure at massive scale, it can also introduce complexity
  due to its various open-source components for orchestration, monitoring, observability
  and security. These components require centralized and consistent support to enhance
  operational efficiency, collaboration, governance and control. The platform approach
  Enterprises can simplify operations by consolidating and ensuring consistency across
  compute, storage, networking and security resources through a unified platform that
  can integrate with other tools and platforms across software development and deployment
  processes.'
