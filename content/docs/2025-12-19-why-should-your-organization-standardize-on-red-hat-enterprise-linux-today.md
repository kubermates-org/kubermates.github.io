  As you likely know, we launched numerous new features and capabilities this year
  with RHEL 10 , including image mode for RHEL , which enables users to create and
  manage operating system images for consistent deployment, and the RHEL command-line
  assistant powered by Lightspeed, which uses generative AI to help users execute
  complex command-line tasks. We also announced the inclusion of post-quantum encryption
  algorithms to help your organization resist future security attacks. More recently,
  with the launch of RHEL 10.1 and 9.7 , we included support for AI accelerators via
  our repositories, and also introduced a RHEL offline command-line assistant in dev
  preview , along with RHEL HPC for Azure. Furthermore, just a few weeks ago, we announced
  the Red Hat Project Hummingbird. These innovative features, capabilities, and key
  announcements—spanning consistency, AI integration, advanced security, and high-performance
  computing—reinforce RHEL''s position as the leading enterprise Linux platform. They
  are a compelling reason to standardize your infrastructure on RHEL, ensuring you
  are equipped with a consistent, secure, and modern operating system foundation ready
  for the future of IT. We have many more exciting developments planned for 2026,
  so stay tuned and make sure you check out the links above in case you missed any
  of these significant announcements. In this blog, I want to discuss how standardizing
  on RHEL across your entire infrastructure will help solve many critical organizational
  challenges and the specific business outcomes it will deliver. Standardizing on
  RHEL refers to adopting a uniform approach to using RHEL across your organization.
  It involves selecting RHEL and implementing it consistently across all systems.'
