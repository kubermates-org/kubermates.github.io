summary: 'New research reveals 15.6 million developers now use cloud native technologies,
  with backend and DevOps professionals leading adoption Key Highlights: CNCF and
  SlashData release State of Cloud Native Development research report. Survey finds
  cloud native adoption has reached 15.6 million developers globally, with backend
  and DevOps (58%) professionals leading the way. Research shows 77% of backend developers
  are using at least one cloud native technology. The report notes cloud infrastructure
  strategies are shifting: hybrid cloud use has grown to 32% and multi-cloud to 26%
  among developers, and distributed cloud is emerging among backend teams. ATLANTA,
  KUBECON + CLOUDNATIVECON NORTH AMERICA – November 11, 2025 – The Cloud Native Computing
  Foundation® (CNCF®), which builds sustainable ecosystems for cloud native software,
  today released new insights from its latest State of Cloud Native Development report
  with SlashData , revealing the evolving footprint of cloud native development across
  backend, AI and DevOps communities. The findings reflect the growing adoption and
  diversification of cloud native practices globally and the effects of cloud native
  in AI. “The data confirms what we’re seeing in the ecosystem: cloud native is expanding
  far beyond traditional backend and container infrastructure use cases,” said Chris
  Aniszczyk, CTO, CNCF. “From platform engineering to AI, developers are incorporating
  cloud native technologies to meet reliability, scalability and operational needs.
  ” Cloud Native Adoption Reaches Scale Cloud native technologies are now a cornerstone
  of modern software delivery. The 15.6 million developers adopting these tools represent
  a critical mass driving efficiency, automation, and resiliency. 77% of backend developers
  report using at least one cloud native technology, highlighting greater adoption.
  Backend and DevOps professionals lead adoption at 58%, reflecting cloud native’s
  deep integration in enterprise operations.'
