  years, the software industry has seen a strong shift toward enabling and supporting
  Artificial Intelligence (AI) workloads. While a variety of high level tools like
  Large Language Models (LLMs) already exist to support generic use cases, many domain
  specific solutions are either not yet available or come with significant development
  costs and risks, particularly when targeting more niche problems.

  (Graduate Project) CNCF | Special Interest Group (SIG) | CNCF Ambassador In recent
  years, the software industry has seen a strong shift toward enabling and supporting
  Artificial Intelligence (AI) workloads. While a variety of high level tools like
  Large Language Models (LLMs) already exist to support generic use cases, many domain
  specific solutions are either not yet available or come with significant development
  costs and risks, particularly when targeting more niche problems. This raises an
  important challenge: how can we avoid building a fragmented AI tooling landscape
  with limited real world applicability? To truly support the next wave of AI innovation,
  especially in cloud native environments, we need to rethink and reinforce our software
  component foundation. This includes standardizing formats, improving cross platform
  interoperability, and evolving Kubernetes with AI native features in mind. One of
  the most promising developments in this space revolves around Open Container Initiative
  (OCI) artifacts. OCI artifacts enable users to store and distribute arbitrary files
  and metadata using OCI compliant container registries. While originally used for
  generic purposes (like ORAS supports them), they’re now finding critical roles in
  AI/ML workflows, especially with the rise of specifications like the CNCF ModelPack.
  The CNCF ModelPack Specification builds on top of OCI artifacts and aims to standardize
  the packaging, distribution, and execution of AI models in cloud native environments.
  By moving away from proprietary formats, ModelPack facilitates reproducibility,
  portability, and vendor neutrality in machine learning workflows. This opens the
  door to several important use cases: Having standards around OCI artifacts are essential
  for building robust AI features into Kubernetes. For example, the Kubernetes Image
  Volume feature allows pods to mount container image layers as read-only volumes.
  Image volumes could also support OCI artifacts as a special use case.'
