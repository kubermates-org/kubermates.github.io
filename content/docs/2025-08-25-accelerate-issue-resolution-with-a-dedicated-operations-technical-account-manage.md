summary: 'Share Building and managing applications and IT infrastructure securely
  is a complex task for even the most skilled individual or team. While Red Hat makes
  it easier to work across platforms and environments with strengthened open source
  solutions, organizations may lack the time and expertise required to take full advantage
  of their current Red Hat investments. With a Dedicated Operations Technical Account
  Manager (TAM), organizations have an embedded resource that serves as an extension
  of their team within Red Hat. Focused on Day 2 diagnostics, remediation, and risk
  mitigation, a Dedicated Operations TAM is the ideal resource for complex, high-uptime,
  or regulated environments. Unlike Red Hat’s standard Technical Account Management
  subscriptions, the Dedicated Operations TAM offers hands-on issue resolution, optional
  on-site presence, and security-cleared personnel, making it a value add for OpenShift,
  Ansible, and compliance-driven customers. TAMs help ensure that you have the tools
  and knowledge needed to continually innovate while maintaining regulatory compliance
  and mitigating risk. Quickly reacting to production downtime and minimizing disruptions
  while building a reliable IT infrastructure and deploying applications is no easy
  task. Today’s IT teams are under pressure to deliver more with fewer resources.
  Bringing in a dedicated expert can provide much-needed support, thereby increasing
  flexibility, improving scalability, and streamlining the management of complex systems.
  Your Dedicated Operations TAM allows you to address your specific needs more effectively.
  Additionally, they provide: A Dedicated Operations TAM is a vital asset for busy
  teams with critical availability requirements, serving as a single point of contact
  for technical guidance, issue resolution, and strategic planning. With deep knowledge
  of your organization’s systems and goals, a TAM helps prioritize tasks, streamlines
  support, and proactively identifies potential challenges before they escalate.'
