  Edge computing Infrastructure Applications Virtualization Share Building and managing
  applications and IT infrastructure securely is a complex task for even the most
  skilled individual or team. While Red Hat makes it easier to work across platforms
  and environments with strengthened open source solutions, organizations may lack
  the time and expertise required to take full advantage of their current Red Hat
  investments. With a Dedicated Operations Technical Account Manager (TAM), organizations
  have an embedded resource that serves as an extension of their team within Red Hat.
  Focused on Day 2 diagnostics, remediation, and risk mitigation, a Dedicated Operations
  TAM is the ideal resource for complex, high-uptime, or regulated environments. Unlike
  Red Hat’s standard Technical Account Management subscriptions, the Dedicated Operations
  TAM offers hands-on issue resolution, optional on-site presence, and security-cleared
  personnel, making it a value add for OpenShift, Ansible, and compliance-driven customers.
  TAMs help ensure that you have the tools and knowledge needed to continually innovate
  while maintaining regulatory compliance and mitigating risk. Quickly reacting to
  production downtime and minimizing disruptions while building a reliable IT infrastructure
  and deploying applications is no easy task. Today’s IT teams are under pressure
  to deliver more with fewer resources. Bringing in a dedicated expert can provide
  much-needed support, thereby increasing flexibility, improving scalability, and
  streamlining the management of complex systems. Your Dedicated Operations TAM allows
  you to address your specific needs more effectively. Additionally, they provide:
  On-location assistance and flexibility : Dedicated Operations TAMs meet you where
  you are, offering flexible service options tailored to your needs. You can opt for
  fully remote TAM service to minimize facility access concerns, or your TAM can be
  fully embedded on-premise, in your day-to-day operations.'
