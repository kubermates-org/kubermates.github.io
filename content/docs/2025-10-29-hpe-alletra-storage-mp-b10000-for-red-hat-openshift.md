  Storage MP B10000 offers the industry’s only disaggregated, scale-out block and
  file storage with a 100% data availability guarantee. It delivers an AI-driven cloud
  management, efficient scale, and extreme resiliency and performance for many Enterprise
  workloads as a Leader in the 2025 Gartner® Magic Quadrant™ for Enterprise storage
  platforms. The B10000 is built on the Alletra Storage MP platform, which offers
  the full gamut of block, file and object tailored to specific data OpenShift workloads.
  HPE GreenLake for File Storage offers scale-out unstructured data with high throughput
  and capacity over NFS. HPE Alletra Storage MP X10000 provides high performance object
  storage tailored for modern AI workloads and data protection at scale. Red Hat OpenShift
  is the industry’s leading hybrid cloud application platform powered by Kubernetes.
  Using OpenShift simplifies and accelerates the development, delivery, and lifecycle
  management of a hybrid mix of applications, delivering more consistency across on-premise,
  public clouds, and at the edge. This blog highlights the HPE Alletra Storage MP
  B10000 and the capabilities enabled for Red Hat OpenShift using the HPE CSI Operator
  for OpenShift. HPE GreenLake for File Storage and HPE Alletra Storage MP X10000
  are both platforms that also may be used directly with OpenShift using native protocols.
  Several efforts are underway to unlock integration points for OpenShift customers
  to take advantage of the entire portfolio in a more seamless manner through CSI
  and COSI drivers in the future. The HPE CSI driver for Kubernetes is a comprehensive
  CSI driver packaged in the Red Hat certified HPE CSI operator for OpenShift. It
  features all the relevant capabilities for private cloud OpenShift and OpenShift
  Virtualization, while providing several innovations outside the CSI spec to differentiate
  the B10000 from being just a storage solution using CSI extensions and customer
  resource definitions (CRD).
