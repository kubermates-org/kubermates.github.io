  Infrastructure Applications Virtualization Share Enterprise technology leaders face
  a central challenge: building the future while managing the present. This requires
  a dual focus: a clear, forward-looking vision for what''s next and the ability to
  execute and deliver results today, at scale, across the entire enterprise. It’s
  this combination of vision and execution that separates leaders from the rest. At
  Red Hat, our strategy is built to help you meet this challenge. Think of your enterprise
  as a thriving city. To function, it needs reliable infrastructure—power, water,
  roads—that work flawlessly today. That’s execution. But it also needs a flexible
  plan to grow that allows for the construction of new commercial spaces, housing,
  parks, and transportation systems in the future. That’s vision. A true hybrid cloud
  platform must meet both needs. It must provide a consistent, adaptable foundation
  that allows you to run your business efficiently while confidently building for
  the future as new technologies like artificial intelligence are deployed. Red Hat
  OpenShift is the platform where your vision meets practical, enterprise-grade execution.'
