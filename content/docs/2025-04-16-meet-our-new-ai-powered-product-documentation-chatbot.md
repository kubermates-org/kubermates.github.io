summary: "By Grace Morgan Searching for the right information in product documentation\
  \ can be time consuming, especially when youâ\x80\x99re deep in the middle of development.\
  \ Thatâ\x80\x99s why weâ\x80\x99re excited to introduce DigitalOceanâ\x80\x99s new\
  \ product documentation chatbot , a new tool designed to help you quickly find accurate\
  \ answers to your pressing product questions sourced directly from DigitalOceanâ\x80\
  \x99s official documentation. Letâ\x80\x99s be honest, while documentation is essential,\
  \ finding the exact answer you need often means clicking through multiple pages,\
  \ refining search terms, or scrolling through long guides. Our new product documentation\
  \ chatbot changes that by allowing you to ask natural-language questions and get\
  \ instant, documentation-backed responses, helping you stay focused on building\
  \ instead of searching. Using the chatbot is as simple as asking a question. Instead\
  \ of digging through pages of documentation, just type what you need, like you would\
  \ with a teammate, and get instant, sourced answers. No guesswork, no wasted time.\
  \ Hereâ\x80\x99s why it makes a difference: This isnâ\x80\x99t just another AI tool,\
  \ itâ\x80\x99s built specifically to make your workflow smoother and your development\
  \ process faster. Whether youâ\x80\x99re troubleshooting, configuring a Droplet,\
  \ or exploring new features, the chatbot helps you get back to coding with confidence.\
  \ The new product documentation chatbot is now live on docs. digitalocean. com."
