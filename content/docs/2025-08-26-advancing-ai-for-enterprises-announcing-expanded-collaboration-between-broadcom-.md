  your GenAI Agents on VCF with Private AI Services Artificial Intelligence (AI) is
  rapidly transforming industries, and Generative AI (Gen AI) is pushing the boundaries
  of what’s possible, creating new content and redefining value creation. However,
  enterprises face significant challenges in AI adoption, especially concerning privacy,
  data security, and the need for adaptable infrastructure. This is why Broadcom announced
  VMware Private AI. Today Broadcom and AMD are announcing the expansion of our collaboration
  to Advance AI for enterprises with a private, secure, and high-performance AI infrastructure.
  We will release in the future a joint platform bringing VMware Cloud Foundation
  (VCF) together with AMD Enterprise AI software and AMD Instinct™ GPUs. Together
  this will enable privacy and security of infrastructure, simplify infrastructure
  management and streamline AI model deployment. We will also enable Broadcom’s Enhanced
  DirectPath (I/O) driver models with AMD GPUs to take advantage of VCF’s unique virtualization
  capabilities for delivering a scalable and efficient platform for AI workloads.
  Our expanded efforts directly tackle the core issues enterprises encounter with
  AI deployments: Privacy & Security: Training AI models on public platforms risks
  exposing sensitive confidential data. Our solution will ensure increased protection
  of intellectual property, confidential data and access control.'
