tldr: Artificial Intelligence (AI) is rapidly transforming industries, and Generative
  AI (Gen AI) is pushing the boundaries of what’s possible, creating new content and
  redefining value creation. However, enterprises face significant challenges in AI
  adoption, especially concerning privacy, data security, and the need for adaptable
  infrastructure.
summary: 'Artificial Intelligence (AI) is rapidly transforming industries, and Generative
  AI (Gen AI) is pushing the boundaries of what’s possible, creating new content and
  redefining value creation. However, enterprises face significant challenges in AI
  adoption, especially concerning privacy, data security, and the need for adaptable
  infrastructure. This is why Broadcom announced VMware Private AI. Today Broadcom
  and AMD are announcing the expansion of our collaboration to Advance AI for enterprises
  with a private, secure, and high-performance AI infrastructure. We will release
  in the future a joint platform bringing VMware Cloud Foundation (VCF) together with
  AMD Enterprise AI software and AMD Instinct™ GPUs. Together this will enable privacy
  and security of infrastructure, simplify infrastructure management and streamline
  AI model deployment. We will also enable Broadcom’s Enhanced DirectPath (I/O) driver
  models with AMD GPUs to take advantage of VCF’s unique virtualization capabilities
  for delivering a scalable and efficient platform for AI workloads. Our expanded
  efforts directly tackle the core issues enterprises encounter with AI deployments:
  The core of this expanded collaboration is a robust architecture we will release
  in the future for enterprise AI. Let’s review the components of this: Note: Supermicro
  Computer Inc. server AS-8125GS-TNMR2 with MI300 GPUs are now supported in DirectPath
  I/O mode with VCF. Let’s get into some of the capabilities that this expanded collaboration
  will enable for customers in future. This collaboration will enable privacy and
  control of corporate data, integrated security and management and help enterprises
  build and deploy private and secure AI models.'
