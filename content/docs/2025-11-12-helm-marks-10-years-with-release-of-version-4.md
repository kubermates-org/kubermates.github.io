summary: Major update introduces new features while maintaining Helm’s role in Kubernetes
  application management Key Highlights Helm 4, the first major update in six years
  to the Kubernetes package manager, is now available, marking Helm’s 10th anniversary.
  This release simplifies and enhances the safety of deploying and managing applications
  at scale, addressing challenges such as CI/CD complexity, security, and multi-cluster
  operations. The target audience includes platform engineers, DevOps teams, Kubernetes
  administrators, open-source contributors, and enterprise users managing modern cloud-native
  infrastructure. Helm 4 was announced at KubeCon + CloudNativeCon North America 2025
  in Atlanta and is available now. Maintainers will offer a technical deep dive and
  live demonstrations at Booth 8B in the Project Pavilion. KubeCon + CloudNativeCon
  North America, ATLANTA, GA – November 12, 2025 – The Cloud Native Computing Foundation®
  (CNCF®) , which builds sustainable ecosystems for cloud native software, today announced
  a major new release of Helm , coinciding with the project’s 10th anniversary. Released
  just weeks after its official anniversary, Helm version 4 marks the first major
  update to the Kubernetes package manager in six years. Helm 4 arrives at a time
  when Kubernetes users are managing increasingly complex application deployments,
  often across multiple clusters and environments. According to the CNCF 2024 Annual
  Survey , 40% of users cite CI/CD complexity as a top challenge, and 37% report security
  as a key barrier to adoption. Helm 4 directly addresses these concerns with improvements
  in testing automation, chart signing, performance, and chart distribution—making
  it easier for teams to ship software faster and more securely at scale. “Helm 4
  is the result of ten years of community insight and real world deployment lessons,”
  said Chris Aniszczyk, CTO of CNCF. “As teams embrace cloud native scale, AI workloads,
  and platform engineering, Helm continues to deliver the reliability and flexibility
  they need to deploy applications with confidence.
