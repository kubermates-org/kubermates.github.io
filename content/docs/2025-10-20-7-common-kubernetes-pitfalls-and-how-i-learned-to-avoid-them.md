  thoughts It’s no secret that Kubernetes can be both powerful and frustrating at
  times. When I first started dabbling with container orchestration, I made more than
  my fair share of mistakes enough to compile a whole list of pitfalls. In this post,
  I want to walk through seven big gotchas I’ve encountered (or seen others run into)
  and share some tips on how to avoid them. Whether you’re just kicking the tires
  on Kubernetes or already managing production clusters, I hope these insights help
  you steer clear of a little extra stress. The pitfall : Not specifying CPU and memory
  requirements in Pod specifications.'
