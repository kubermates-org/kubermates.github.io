  Infrastructure Applications Virtualization Share America’s AI Action Plan emphasizes
  speed, scale, and efficiency through deregulation, faster permitting, and infrastructure
  build-out. It promotes open-source/open-weight models, energy expansion, and ideological
  neutrality while avoiding green labels despite its focus on sustainability. Learn
  more Marco Bill discusses the challenges that IT leaders face today, and how Red
  Hat OpenShift offers a unified platform to manage containerized, virtualized, and
  AI workloads across hybrid cloud environments, improving consistency, speed-to-production,
  and developer autonomy. Learn more Rakuten Mobile aimed to shake up Japan’s telecom
  market with lean operations, cloud-native tech, and open RAN innovation. It achieved
  modest subscriber growth and its first positive earnings before interest, tax, depreciation
  and amortization profit, but still trails incumbents in scale and network performance.
  Learn more What do Llama Stack and Kubernetes have in common? Red Hat''s Cedric
  Clyburn explains how this open-source framework simplifies building enterprise-ready
  generative AI systems. Discover how Llama Stack integrates RAG, AI agents, and modular
  APIs to create scalable and portable AI applications. Learn more Axiom Space and
  Red Hat launched the AxDCU-1 prototype to the ISS to test space-based edge computing
  using Red Hat Device Edge with MicroShift, enabling autonomous, resilient containerized
  workloads, real-time processing in orbit, and efficient OTA updates despite limited
  connectivity. Learn more Red Hat is the world’s leading provider of enterprise open
  source software solutions, using a community-powered approach to deliver reliable
  and high-performing Linux, hybrid cloud, container, and Kubernetes technologies.
