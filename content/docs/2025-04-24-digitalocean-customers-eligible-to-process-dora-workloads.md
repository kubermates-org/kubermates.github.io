summary: "By David Lopez Staff Trust & Governance Advisor, Trust and Governance Today,\
  \ weâ\x80\x99re excited to announce that DigitalOcean will begin signing Digital\
  \ Operational Resilience Act (DORA) Addendums with eligible customers. Additionally,\
  \ we engaged Schellman & Company to facilitate an audit of our environment, so that\
  \ customers can deploy on DigitalOcean with trust in the organizationâ\x80\x99s\
  \ risk management, security controls, operational resilience, incident management\
  \ and reporting, and outsourcing and third party risk management. Effective January\
  \ 17, 2025, financial entities operating in the European Union (EU) and Information\
  \ and Communications Technology (ICT) third-party service providers are subject\
  \ to the EUâ\x80\x99s DORA. The regulation standardizes how financial entities report\
  \ major ICT-related incidents, test their digital operational resilience, and manage\
  \ ICT third-party risk across the financial services sector and EU member states.\
  \ While DigitalOcean has not yet been designated a critical Information and Communications\
  \ Technology (ICT) third-party service provider by European Supervisory Authorities,\
  \ we recognize the need to enable select customers to address their DORA obligations\
  \ relative to ICT third-party service providers, which can include; but, are not\
  \ limited to, cloud service providers. Customers who require the DORA Addendum can\
  \ request the document by contacting Sales. As part of our continued commitment\
  \ to you, we engaged Schellman Compliance, LLC to facilitate an audit of our environment\
  \ against DORAâ\x80\x99s core regulatory framework, relevant Regulatory Technical\
  \ Standards (RTS) and Implementation Technical Standards (ITS). The assessment returned\
  \ zero findings. A summary letter can be viewed within our Trust Platform. Share\
