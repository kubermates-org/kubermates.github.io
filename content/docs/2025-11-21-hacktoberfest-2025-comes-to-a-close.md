  Hacktoberfest 2025: Celebrate All Things Open Source! By Haimantika Mitra and Bedabrata
  Bagchi Updated: November 21, 2025 4 min read October rolled around again, and with
  it came Hacktoberfest for its 12th year where contributors and open-source communities
  across the globe came together to build, contribute, and make tech more accessible
  for everyone. This year saw—as it does every year—developers, maintainers, and first-time
  contributors working side by side, creating solutions that matter to open source.
  A huge thank you to everyone who participated and made this Hacktoberfest special.
  We saw a lot of new faces join the celebration this year, and it’s exciting to see
  the community grow! What really stood out this year? The genuine enthusiasm. People
  were here to contribute, collaborate, and make a tangible impact on open source
  projects. That’s what Hacktoberfest is all about: getting more people involved in
  open source and working together to improve the software that powers our world.
  It’s fulfilling to see how Hacktoberfest continues to inspire developers and successfully
  achieves what we set out to do. Here’s what Mike Swift, Co-founder and CEO of MLH
  has to say about Hacktoberfest this year: “What I enjoyed most about this year’s
  Hacktoberfest was seeing next-gen developers step into open source with genuine
  curiosity and realize they could make meaningful contributions. They approached
  issues, learned from maintainers, and connected those experiences to the AI tools
  shaping their work. Being part of moments like that is incredibly rewarding and
  exactly why the MLH community exists. ” This year we increased the number of PRs
  from 4 to 6.'
