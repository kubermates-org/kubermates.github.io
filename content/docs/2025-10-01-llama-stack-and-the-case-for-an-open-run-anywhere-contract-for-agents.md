  Share Why do we really need Llama Stack when popular frameworks like LangChain,
  LangFlow, and CrewAI already exist? This is the question we get asked most often.
  It’s a fair one—after all, those frameworks already give developers rich tooling
  for retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and agents. But we see Llama Stack as more
  than “another agent framework. ” It’s better understood as four distinct layers:
  A familiar surface for building agents. Here it overlaps with LangChain, LangFlow,
  and CrewAI. Developers can author agents using common abstractions. Example : An
  agent built with CrewAI looks like a small project folder with config files and
  environment variables.'
