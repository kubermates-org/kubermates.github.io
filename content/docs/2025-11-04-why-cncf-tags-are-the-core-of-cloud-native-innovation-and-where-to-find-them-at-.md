  The Linux Foundation KubeCon + CloudNativeCon North America 2025 is just around
  the corner in Atlanta. While you’re mapping out your schedule for co-located events
  like Observability Day and Platform Engineering Day, don’t forget to connect with
  the groups laying the foundation for our entire ecosystem: the Technical Advisory
  Groups (TAGs). If governance sounds boring, think again. TAGs are where the real
  work of defining best practices, solving pervasive technical problems, and shaping
  the future of cloud native happens. Here’s a quick guide to what TAGs are, what
  they cover, and the can’t-miss sessions they are hosting in Atlanta! At the heart
  of the CNCF is the Technical Oversight Committee (TOC) , which acts as the technical
  governing body. The TOC is responsible for defining the technical vision, approving
  new projects, and driving common practices across the entire CNCF portfolio. TAGs
  serve as a crucial extension of the TOC. Their fundamental goal is to support the
  CNCF’s technical vision by solving problems faced by adopters. They work to: 1.
  Strengthen the project ecosystem: Ensuring projects meet the needs of both end users
  and contributors. 2. Act as a bridge: Surfacing common problems between projects
  and driving alignment.'
