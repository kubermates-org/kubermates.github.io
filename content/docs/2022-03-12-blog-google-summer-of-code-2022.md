  the timeline. Apply as early as possible. This post aims to give GSoC contributors
  insight into the selection process and how to get started. We have 3 mentors signed
  up at the moment and are looking to select a maximum of 2 applicants. We want you
  to have a great experience contributing to Jenkins X and learn lots of new things!
  You do not have to complete all of these tasks. This is presented here so that you
  have some clarity around where to start and which resources to follow. We will start
  interviewing candidates between April 19 and May 12. We want to talk to you individually,
  and get to know you better. Contributors will be scored based on the following criteria:
  Important: Nice to have: Technical expertise (basic knowledge goes a long way):
  Past open source contribution experience Any level of familiarity with Jenkins X
  (or other CI/CD tools) Complete one of the three tasks listed below (If you have
  any questions on these tasks, please ask in our slack channel and we’ll be happy
  to answer your questions): Previous GSoC experience (first time contributors are
  more than welcome) We will make an effort to talk individually to all the Jenkins
  X GSoC contributor applicants. We look forward to reviewing your application and
  working with you.'
