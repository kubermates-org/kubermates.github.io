summary: Keeping track of Kubernetes policy violations across namespaces and clusters
  can be tedious, especially when teams rely on disconnected tools and manual workflows.
  With Nirmata Control Hub’s Jira integration, you can automatically or manually create
  Jira tickets for policy violations directly from the platform. This ensures accountability,
  reduces MTTR (mean time to resolution), and improves team productivity by embedding
  policy compliance into your teams’ tools. Every misconfiguration or policy violation
  is a potential security or compliance risk. However, identifying issues is only
  the first step. The real value is in closing the loop—from detection to resolution.
  Traditionally, teams rely on Slack alerts, dashboards, or Excel exports to track
  violations. But these quickly fall out of sync with what’s happening in the cluster
  or Git. Hira is where real work happens, and that’s where Nirmata Control Hub (NCH)
  now meets your team. From any Policy Reports page, users can instantly generate
  a Jira issue for violations. Simply click “Create Jira Issue” and fill in the ticket
  details, such as project, title, issue type, priority, and assignee. This creates
  traceability right at the source of the ossie, whether it;s a misconfigured deployment,
  a missing securityContext, or a policy deviation.
