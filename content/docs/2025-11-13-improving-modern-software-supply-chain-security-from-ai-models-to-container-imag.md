  Security Edge computing Infrastructure Applications Virtualization Share The software
  supply chain has evolved dramatically in recent years. Today''s applications integrate
  countless components—from open source libraries and container images to AI models
  and training datasets. Each element represents a potential security risk that organizations
  must understand, verify, and continuously monitor. As supply chain attacks increase
  in frequency and sophistication, enterprises need comprehensive solutions that provide
  both artifact integrity and deep visibility into their software dependencies. Red
  Hat''s latest releases of Red Hat Trusted Artifact Signer 1.3 and Red Hat Trusted
  Profile Analyzer 2.2 deliver a powerful combination of cryptographic signing capabilities
  and advanced supply chain analysis, addressing a full spectrum of modern software
  security challenges, including the emerging complexities of AI-powered applications.
  Modern applications are built from diverse components that create an intricate web
  of dependencies. Traditional software includes operating system (OS) packages, application
  libraries, and container base images. But today''s AI-powered applications introduce
  additional complexity with machine learning (ML) models, training datasets, and
  inference frameworks—each requiring specialized security considerations. This complexity
  creates multiple attack vectors. Malicious actors can compromise software at build
  time by injecting code into repositories, at distribution time by replacing legitimate
  packages with malicious versions, or at deployment time by exploiting weak verification
  processes. The 2025 supply chain attack on popular npm packages demonstrated that
  a single compromised component can affect thousands of downstream organizations.
  Trusted Artifact Signer 1.3 helps to address these challenges by providing enterprise-grade
  cryptographic signing and verification for all software artifacts.'
