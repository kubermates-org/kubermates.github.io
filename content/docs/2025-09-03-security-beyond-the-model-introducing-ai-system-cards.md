  Share AI is one of the most significant innovations to emerge in the last 5 years.
  Generative AI (gen AI) models are now smaller, faster, and cheaper to run. They
  can solve mathematical problems, analyze situations, and even reason about cause‑and‑effect
  relationships to generate insights that once required human expertise. On its own,
  an AI model is merely a set of trained weights and mathematical operations, an impressive
  engine, but one sitting idle on a test bench. Business value only emerges when that
  model is embedded within a complete AI system: data pipelines feed it clean, context‑rich
  inputs, application logic orchestrates pre‑ and post‑processing, guardrails and
  monitoring enforce safety, security, and compliance, and user interfaces deliver
  insights through chatbots, dashboards, or automated actions. In practice, end users
  engage with systems, not raw models, which is why a single foundational model can
  power hundreds of tailored solutions across domains. Without the surrounding infrastructure
  of an AI system, even the most advanced model remains untapped potential rather
  than a tool that solves real‑world problems. AI model cards are files that accompany
  and describe the model, helping AI system developers make informed decisions about
  which model to choose for their applications. Model cards present a concise, standardized
  snapshot of each model’s strengths, limitations, and training information, summarizing
  performance metrics across key benchmarks, detailing the data and methodology used
  for training and evaluation, highlighting known biases and failure modes, and spelling
  out licensing terms and governance contacts. With this information in one place,
  it''s easier to assess whether a model aligns with accuracy targets, fairness requirements,
  deployment constraints, and compliance obligations, reducing integration risk and
  accelerating responsible adoption. In November 2024, we authored a paper addressing
  the rapidly evolving ecosystem of publicly available AI models and their potential
  implications for security and safety. In this paper we proposed standardization
  of model cards and extensions to include safety, security, and data governance and
  pedigree information.'
