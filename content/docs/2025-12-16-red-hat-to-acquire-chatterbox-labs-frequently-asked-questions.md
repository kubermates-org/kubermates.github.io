  2025, Red Hat announced the acquisition of Chatterbox Labs , a pioneer in model-agnostic
  AI safety and generative AI (gen AI) guardrails. The following questions and answers
  provide additional context on the acquisition and what it means for Red Hat customers
  and partners. What is the news? Red Hat announced on December 16, 2025, that it
  has acquired Chatterbox Labs, a private company founded in 2011 that provides model
  testing and gen AI guardrails. Chatterbox Labs technology, known as the AIMI platform,
  delivers quantitative AI risk metrics to help organizations validate that their
  data and models are safe, transparent, and compliant with global regulations. Who
  is Chatterbox Labs? Founded in 2011 and headquartered in London with an office in
  New York City, Chatterbox Labs is a team of researchers and engineers focused on
  addressing the unintended consequences of AI. Their team brings a deep academic
  pedigree and more than a decade of experience in machine learning systems. Why is
  Red Hat acquiring Chatterbox Labs? As enterprises move AI from experimentation to
  production, the ability to monitor models for bias, toxicity, and vulnerabilities
  is critical. Guardrails and safety testing have become "table stakes" for modern
  MLOps and LLMOps platforms. This acquisition directly addresses the growing need
  for "security for AI. " By integrating Chatterbox Labs technology, Red Hat aims
  to provide a comprehensive enterprise open source AI platform that enables customers
  to run production workloads with confidence. How does Chatterbox Labs fit into the
  Red Hat AI portfolio? Chatterbox Labs complements Red Hat’s existing AI portfolio,
  including Red Hat AI Inference Server, Red Hat Enterprise Linux AI (RHEL AI) and
  Red Hat OpenShift AI. Following the recent launch of Red Hat AI 3 , which introduced
  capabilities for agentic AI and Model Context Protocol (MCP), Chatterbox Labs adds
  a critical layer of safety and transparency for these advanced workloads.'
