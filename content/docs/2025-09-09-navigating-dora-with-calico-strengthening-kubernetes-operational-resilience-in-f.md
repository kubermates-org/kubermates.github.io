  A single cyberattack or system outage can threaten not just one financial institution,
  but the stability of a vast portion of the entire financial sector. For today’s
  financial enterprises, securing dynamic infrastructure like Kubernetes is a core
  operational and regulatory challenge. The solution lies in achieving DORA compliance
  for Kubernetes, which transforms your cloud-native infrastructure into a resilient,
  compliant, and secure backbone for critical financial services. Before DORA (Digital
  Operational Resilience Act), rules for financial companies primarily focused on
  making sure they had enough financial capital to cover losses. But what if a cyberattack
  or tech failure brought a large part of the financial system down? Even with plenty
  of financial capital, a major outage could stop most operations and cause big problems
  for the whole financial market. DORA steps in to fix this. It’s all about making
  sure financial firms can withstand, respond to, and recover quickly from cyberattacks
  and other digital disruptions. The Digital Operational Resilience Act (DORA) is
  a European Union (EU) regulation that came into effect on January 17, 2025 and is
  designed to strengthen the security of financial entities. It establishes uniform
  requirements across the financial sector for managing Information and Communication
  Technology (ICT) risk, reporting major ICT-related incidents, conducting digital
  operational resilience testing, and overseeing ICT third-party risk. DORA applies
  to a broad range of financial entities, including banks, insurance companies, investment
  firms, payment service providers, and their ICT third-party service providers, ensuring
  a consolidated and robust approach to digital resilience across the European Union.
  Kubernetes is the standard for deploying and managing cloud-native containerized
  applications, offering unparalleled agility, scalability, and efficiency. However,
  this power comes bundled with complexity.
