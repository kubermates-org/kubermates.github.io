  2025 5 min read 2025 was a busy and transformative year for DigitalOcean Managed
  Kubernetes, marked by a series of releases that make DigitalOcean Kubernetes simpler,
  more secure, and more scalable for developers and growing businesses. Across engine
  upgrades, networking and security enhancements, autoscaling improvements, and new
  ecosystem integrations, this year’s updates aimed to give teams more power with
  less operational overhead. Whether users are running production workloads, experimenting
  with microservices, or scaling customer-facing applications, the enhancements launched
  throughout 2025 make it easier than ever to deploy, manage, and optimize Kubernetes
  on DigitalOcean. In this recap, we’ll walk through the major releases that shaped
  the platform over the past year and how they help developers move faster with confidence.
  In March, we rolled out four major upgrades to DigitalOcean Kubernetes (DOKS) that
  make it easier to run larger and more efficient workloads: increased cluster capacity,
  VPC-native networking, eBPF-powered routing, and Managed Cilium. Here’s a look at
  each one: Cluster capacity has doubled from 500 to 1,000 worker nodes , allowing
  bigger applications to run on a single cluster without the overhead of managing
  multiple environments. Cluster capacity has doubled from 500 to 1,000 worker nodes
  , allowing bigger applications to run on a single cluster without the overhead of
  managing multiple environments. VPC-native Kubernetes now assigns IPs directly from
  your VPC, improving performance and simplifying communication with other cloud resources.
  Replacing kube-proxy with eBPF-based networking and routing delivers faster packet
  processing and lower latency, benefiting high-traffic and real-time workloads. Managed
  Cilium with Hubble for observability adds stronger security, modern networking,
  and easier troubleshooting. Together, these features significantly boost scalability,
  performance, and reliability while reducing operational complexity of DOKS, so developers
  gain clearer visibility and a simpler networking stack, while businesses benefit
  from lower overhead and the ability to scale applications more efficiently. In July,
  we introduced four powerful new features to help you build and deploy more efficient
  applications on DigitalOcean Kubernetes—especially AI and machine-learning workloads.'
