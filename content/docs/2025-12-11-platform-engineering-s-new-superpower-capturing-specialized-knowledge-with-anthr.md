  Here’s the reality for any platform team – No single person can be an expert in
  all of it. This constant demand for deep, specialized knowledge across dozens of
  systems creates inevitable bottlenecks and forces firefighting. This specialization
  gap is the raison d’être for our field, and there needs to be a way to bridge it.
  Recently, we found a potential answer in Anthropic SKILLs , and a production MongoDB
  alert proved its transformative value. Anthropic recently released the concept of
  a SKILL. Simply put, a SKILL is a way to give an LLM reliable, specialized capabilities
  that go beyond its general training data. You’re essentially providing the AI with
  a custom, specialized tool and clear instructions on how and when to use it. It’s
  the mechanism to transform a general purpose LLM into a highly effective specialist.
  At Nirmata, we recognized this potential, and immediately integrated support for
  it in our Nirmata AI platform engineering assistant. Our assistant came pre-loaded
  with native SKILLs focused on our domain, such as Policy conversion ( OPA to Kyverno
  , between Kyverno versions), Kyverno policy generation and Chainsaw tests. But the
  real game-changer is the ability for the agent to discover and learn new SKILLs.
  The opportunity to test this capability came quickly.
