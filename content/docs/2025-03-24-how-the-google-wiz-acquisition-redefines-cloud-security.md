summary: Google’s acquisition of Wiz, announced last week, is a pivotal moment as
  it marks a strategic shift in how cyber security will evolve over the next few years.
  It instantly turns Google into a major player in security, adding Wiz to other building
  blocks Google has racked up in the past couple of years, most notably Mandiant and
  Google Chronicle. Google will be a new gorilla in the security market, just as Microsoft
  created a thriving, multi-billion dollar business out of the Defender product line.
  But while Microsoft has a long history of “owning” operating systems, servers, and
  Office applications, and is leveraging that to expand its footprint, Google is new
  to the enterprise security business. In the first phase of public cloud adoption,
  the “lift and shift” phase, CSPM (cloud security posture management) emerged to
  ensure proper configuration of cloud services, and CWPP (cloud workload protection
  platforms) to monitor and protect workloads running in the cloud. The second phase
  of cloud adoption, the cloud native phase, driven by technologies such as containers,
  serverless functions, CI/CD, and orchestration (Kubernetes), imparted an even more
  dramatic change in security – the integration of multiple silos of application related
  security information. It introduced integrated shift left capabilities , providing
  a broader risk-based approach to vulnerability management, hardening, and incident
  management. Thus CNAPP (cloud native application protection platforms) was born.
  In the early days of cloud services, the cloud providers adopted the shared responsibility
  model in which some responsibilities were borne by them (such as infrastructure
  and physical security), others were clearly on the shoulders of customers (configuring
  of services, their data, their users, their applications), and there’s been a non-negligible
  area of “shared responsibility” where the answer is often “it depends”. I believe
  that with this move, Google is shifting the borders within this model and will be
  offering more of the posture management and visibility to customers as part of its
  infrastructure. After all this is what Wiz has become famous for – agentless scanning
  of the cloud estate, providing broad visibility and risk assessment. And this is
  something a cloud provider can easily integrate into cloud operations.
