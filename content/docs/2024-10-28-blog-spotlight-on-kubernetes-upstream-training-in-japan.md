summary: 'Spotlight on Kubernetes Upstream Training in Japan What is Kubernetes upstream
  training in Japan? Interview with participants Keita Mochizuki ( NTT DATA Group
  Corporation ) Yoshiki Fujikane ( CyberAgent, Inc. ) Future of Kubernetes upstream
  training We are organizers of Kubernetes Upstream Training in Japan. Our team is
  composed of members who actively contribute to Kubernetes, including individuals
  who hold roles such as member, reviewer, approver, and chair. Our goal is to increase
  the number of Kubernetes contributors and foster the growth of the community. While
  Kubernetes community is friendly and collaborative, newcomers may find the first
  step of contributing to be a bit challenging. Our training program aims to lower
  that barrier and create an environment where even beginners can participate smoothly.
  Our training started in 2019 and is held 1 to 2 times a year. Initially, Kubernetes
  Upstream Training was conducted as a co-located event of KubeCon (Kubernetes Contributor
  Summit), but we launched Kubernetes Upstream Training in Japan with the aim of increasing
  Japanese contributors by hosting a similar event in Japan. Before the pandemic,
  the training was held in person, but since 2020, it has been conducted online. The
  training offers the following content for those who have not yet contributed to
  Kubernetes: Introduction to Kubernetes community Overview of Kubernetes codebase
  and how to create your first PR Tips and encouragement to lower participation barriers,
  such as language How to set up the development environment Hands-on session using
  kubernetes-sigs/contributor-playground At the beginning of the program, we explain
  why contributing to Kubernetes is important and who can contribute. We emphasize
  that contributing to Kubernetes allows you to make a global impact and that Kubernetes
  community is looking forward to your contributions! We also explain Kubernetes community,
  SIGs, and Working Groups. Next, we explain the roles and responsibilities of Member,
  Reviewer, Approver, Tech Lead, and Chair.'
