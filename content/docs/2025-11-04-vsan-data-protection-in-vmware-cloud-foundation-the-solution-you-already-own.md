  Smarter VM Deployment for Performance and Efficiency With a flurry of announcements
  and new capabilities offered in VMware Cloud Foundation (VCF) 9.0, it is sometimes
  easy to overlook relatively new features hidden in plain sight. Protecting data
  in a private cloud has been a hot topic as of late, extending well beyond just typical
  data recovery requirements. Customers are looking to devise practical strategies
  to protect themselves against ransomware attacks and disaster recovery using solutions
  that are easy to manage at scale. vSAN Data Protection initially debuted in vSAN
  8 U3, as a part of VMware Cloud Foundation 5.2. Perhaps the most overlooked aspect
  of vSAN Data Protection is that it is a part of the VCF license! Why is this so
  important? If you are running vSAN ESA in your VCF environment, you have everything
  you need to locally protect your workloads using vSAN Data Protection. It can serve
  as a terrific way to augment your existing protection strategies or serve as the
  foundation for more comprehensive protection. Let’s take a brief look at what this
  local protection can do for you, and how you can adopt it in a simple and scalable
  way. As a part of your VCF license, vSAN Data Protection gives you the ability to
  use snapshots the way you always envisioned. Using vSAN ESA’s native snapshotting
  engine, it allows you to: Easily define groups of VMs and their protection and retention
  schedules — retaining up to 200 snapshots per VM. Create crash-consistent snapshots
  of VMs at regular intervals with little to no impact on performance. Easily restore
  one or more VMs directly in vCenter Server using the vSphere Client, even if they
  have been removed from inventory. Since vSAN Data Protection protects at the VM
  level, protecting and restoring discrete VMDKs within a VM is not possible at this
  time.'
