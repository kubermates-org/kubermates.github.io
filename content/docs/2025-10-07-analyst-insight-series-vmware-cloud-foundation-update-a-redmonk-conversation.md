  Insight Series: VMware Cloud Foundation Update - A RedMonk Conversation VCF Breakroom
  Chats Episode 61: From VI Admin to Cloud Hero - Building a Multi-Tenant Cloud with
  VCF 9.0 VMware Cloud Foundation Automation – Infrastructure Resource Policy Overview
  In this new Redmonk Conversation, James Governor, co-founder of Redmonk, interviews
  Prashanth Shenoy, VP of Marketing, VMware Cloud Foundation Division at Broadcom.
  Redmonk is an advisory firm specializing in developer strategy, open source, and
  community building. James has made a career of understanding what motivates developers
  and the teams that support them. Governor and Shenoy address developments at VMware
  since the acquisition by Broadcom in November 2023, including the recent launch
  of VMware Cloud Foundation (VCF) 9.0, our industry leading private cloud solution.
  They cover a wide range of topics, including VMware’s business model simplification
  post-acquisition. Shenoy discusses the dramatically simplified portfolio of offerings,
  product licensing changes, and the greater focus on delivering a single, integrated
  private cloud platform with VMware Cloud Foundation. While acknowledging these changes
  may have caused some disruption for customers and partners, he points out that they
  have resulted in a more streamlined product experience and lower total cost of ownership
  for VMware’s customers, as well as greater standardization within the partner ecosystem.
  Shenoy covers the new capabilities in VCF 9.0 and how they support strategic customers
  interested in cloud transformation and application modernization, while improving
  overall security. He covers how Broadcom’s leadership in GPU virtualization and
  management is helping customers move at the pace of AI. He discusses how new Kubernetes
  and DevOps capabilities and VCF’s single platform for deploying and managing containers
  and VMs is helping to deliver a frictionless modern apps experience for Platform
  Engineers and application teams. At Broadcom, we view IT as a business enabler and
  key contributor to an organization’s success. This interview demonstrates that,
  post-acquisition, Broadcom’s commitment to supporting our customers in this respect
  is greater than ever.'
