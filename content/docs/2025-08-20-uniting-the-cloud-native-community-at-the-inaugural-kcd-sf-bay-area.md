  Ambassadors The cloud native landscape is constantly evolving, and staying ahead
  of the curve means more than just reading documentation—it means connecting with
  the people who are shaping the future. That’s exactly what the inaugural Kubernetes
  Community Day (KCD) SF Bay Area event is all about. This full-day gathering, proudly
  sponsored by the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF), is the ultimate opportunity
  for enthusiasts, developers, and industry leaders to come together for a day of
  insightful talks and unparalleled networking. On September 9th , the historic Computer
  History Museum in Mountain View will open its doors to the Bay Area’s thriving cloud
  native community. This isn’t just a conference; it’s a celebration of collaboration
  and knowledge sharing. As an added bonus, your event registration grants you access
  to the museum’s fascinating exhibits, allowing you to explore the history of technology
  during your breaks. The KCD SF Bay Area event boasts an incredible lineup of speakers
  and visionaries. You’ll have the chance to hear directly from some of the most influential
  minds in the cloud native space. Confirmed speakers include: Solomon Hykes , the
  founder of Docker and Dagger. io, whose work has fundamentally changed the way we
  build and deploy applications. Jim Bugwadia , founder of Nirmata and a key maintainer
  of the popular policy engine Kyverno. Ramiro Berrelleza , founder of Okteto, who
  is dedicated to simplifying cloud native development workflows.'
