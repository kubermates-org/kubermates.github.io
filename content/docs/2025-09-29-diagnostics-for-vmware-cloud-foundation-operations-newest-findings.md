  Cloud Foundation Diagnostics for VMware Cloud Foundation is a centralized platform
  that monitors the overall operational status of the VMware Cloud Foundation(VCF)
  software stack. It is a self-service platform that helps you analyze and troubleshoot
  the components of VMware Cloud Foundation, including vCenter, ESXi, vSAN, capabilities
  such as vSphere vMotion, snapshots, VM provisioning, and other issues including
  security advisories and certificates. As an Infrastructure admin, you can monitor
  the operational state of your environment using diagnostics findings Diagnostics
  Findings which were previously delivered through Skyline Advisor and Skyline Health
  Diagnostics are available to VCF and vSphere Foundation (VVF) customers in VCF Operations.
  Findings are prioritized by trending issues in Broadcom Technical Support, issues
  raised through post escalation review, security vulnerabilities, issues raised from
  Broadcom engineering, and nominated by customers. For the most recent release of
  VCF Operations, we released 114 new Findings. Of these, there are 83 Findings based
  on trending issues, 15 based on post escalation reviews, 14 based on VMSA, and 2
  based on nominations. There are 62 Health findings, these are findings that are
  equivalent to Skyline Advisor findings. Health findings are automatically checked
  against your environment every 4 hours. There are 52 log based findings that are
  equivalent to Skyline Health Diagnostics findings. Log based findings are manually
  initiated against your environment by choosing refresh against the configuration
  operations instances. These new findings are released in VCF Operations 9.0.1. Release
  Notes Security Vulnerabilities In VMSA-2025-0010, VMware vCenter Server authenticated
