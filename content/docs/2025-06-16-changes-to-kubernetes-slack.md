summary: 'UPDATE : We’ve received notice from Salesforce that our Slack workspace
  WILL NOT BE DOWNGRADED on June 20th. Stand by for more details, but for now, there
  is no urgency to back up private channels or direct messages. Kubernetes Slack will
  lose its special status and will be changing into a standard free Slack on June
  20, 2025. Sometime later this year, our community may move to a new platform. If
  you are responsible for a channel or private channel, or a member of a User Group,
  you will need to take some actions as soon as you can. For the last decade, Slack
  has supported our project with a free customized enterprise account. They have let
  us know that they can no longer do so, particularly since our Slack is one of the
  largest and more active ones on the platform. As such, they will be downgrading
  it to a standard free Slack while we decide on, and implement, other options. On
  Friday, June 20, we will be subject to the feature limitations of free Slack. The
  primary ones which will affect us will be only retaining 90 days of history, and
  having to disable several apps and workflows which we are currently using. The Slack
  Admin team will do their best to manage these limitations. Responsible channel owners,
  members of private channels, and members of User Groups should take some actions
  to prepare for the upgrade and preserve information as soon as possible.'
