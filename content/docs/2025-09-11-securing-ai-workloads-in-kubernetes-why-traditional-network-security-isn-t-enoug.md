summary: 'AI Architectures Introduce New Attack Vectors The Multi-Cluster Problem
  The East-West Traffic Dilemma Egress Control Complexity Why Kubernetes Native Security

  Calico in Action: Example Use Cases The AI revolution is here, and it’s running
  on Kubernetes. From fraud detection systems to generative AI platforms, AI-powered
  applications are no longer experimental projects; they’re mission-critical infrastructure.
  But with great power comes great responsibility, and for Kubernetes platform teams,
  that means rethinking security. But this rapid adoption comes with a challenge:
  13% of organizations have already reported breaches of AI models or applications
  , while another 8% don’t even know if they’ve been compromised. Even more concerning,
  97% of breached organizations reported that they lacked proper AI access controls.
  To address this, we must recognize that AI architectures introduce entirely new
  attack vectors that traditional security models aren’t equipped to handle. AI workloads
  running in Kubernetes environments introduce a new set of security challenges. Traditional
  security models often fall short in addressing the unique complexities of AI pipelines,
  specifically related to The Multi-Cluster Problem, The East-West Traffic Dilemma
  , and Egress Control Complexity. Let’s explore each of these critical attack vectors
  in detail. Most enterprise AI deployments don’t run in a single cluster. Instead,
  they typically follow this pattern: Training Infrastructure (GPU-Heavy) Dedicated
  clusters with high-memory GPU nodes Batch job processing for model training and
  fine-tuning Access to large-scale data stores and feature engineering pipelines
  Often deployed in public cloud for elastic capacity Inference Infrastructure (Latency-Optimized)
  CPU or smaller GPU configurations optimized for low-latency responses Real-time
  prediction APIs with auto-scaling based on demand Often deployed on-premises or
  in edge locations for compliance and latency Integration with production application
  stacks Development and Experimentation Clusters Mixed workloads for data science
  experimentation Access to production data for model development Often less stringently
  controlled than production environments This multi-cluster architecture creates
  network policy enforcement gaps. A data scientist with legitimate permissions to
  the development cluster shouldn’t be able to access production model weights, but
  traditional Kubernetes security tools can’t enforce consistent policies across these
  distributed environments.'
