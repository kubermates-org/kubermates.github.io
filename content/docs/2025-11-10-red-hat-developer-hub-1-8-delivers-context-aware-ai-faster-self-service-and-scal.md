  Share The biggest frustration for modern developers isn''t the code; it''s the friction.
  It’s the constant context switching, the endless search for the right internal document,
  and the risk of building on outdated standards. 50% of developers reported losing
  10+ hours a week to non-coding tasks, which can equate to a ~$1.6 million loss per
  100 engineers per year. Organizations need to empower developers with a self-service
  experience that is fast, highly personalized and grounded in the company''s unique
  development standards. That''s why we’re excited to announce Red Hat Developer Hub
  1.8 , the latest version of our enterprise-grade developer portal based on the Backstage
  project. New features and enhancements in this release provide users: AI tools to
  boost productivity and integrate AI into applications Lifecycle tools to scale governance,
  get support more easily, and extend functionality faster A more personalized experience
  for faster self-service and onboarding To unlock higher productivity with AI-assistance,
  the AI itself needs to be context-aware. Red Hat Developer Hub 1.8 introduces the
  foundational architecture to make this happen, turning the platform into an intelligent
  partner that understands your environment. Beyond the core architecture, we''re
  simplifying how you integrate AI into your applications. Developers shouldn''t have
  to interrupt their workflow to hunt for models. Productivity increases when models
  live alongside their existing tools. Red Hat Developer Hub 1.8 delivers several
  key features to establish this new intelligent foundation and streamline AI integration:
  Red Hat Developer Lightspeed for Red Hat Developer Hub is now powered by Llama Stack
  : Developer Lightspeed, an assistant that helps developers complete their non-coding
  tasks faster, is now built on top of the open source Llama Stack framework, an emerging
  industry standard for agentic AI systems (available as a developer preview). With
  this more flexible foundation, Developer Lightspeed can now utilize many of the
  open source project’s abstractions and features, including MCP agents and RAG, which
  will allow customers to bring their own knowledge in future releases.'
