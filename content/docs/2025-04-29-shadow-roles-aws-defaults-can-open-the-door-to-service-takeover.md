summary: What if the biggest risk to your cloud environment wasn’t a misconfiguration
  you made, but one baked into the defaults? Our research uncovered security concerns
  in the deployment of resources within a few AWS services, specifically in the default
  AWS service roles. These roles, often created automatically or recommended during
  setup, grant overly broad permissions, such as full S3 access. These default roles
  silently introduce attack paths that allow privilege escalation, cross-service access,
  and even potential account compromise. Aqua Security is the largest pure-play cloud
  native security company, providing customers the freedom to innovate and accelerate
  their digital transformations. The Aqua Platform is the leading Cloud Native Application
  Protection Platform (CNAPP) and provides prevention, detection, and response automation
