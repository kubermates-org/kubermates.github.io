  4 min read 2025 was a big year for DigitalOcean Managed Databases, packed with meaningful
  enhancements designed to deliver more power, flexibility, and simplicity for developers
  and businesses of all sizes. With performance boosts and new database engines introduced
  to improve scalability, automation, and observability, this year’s releases focused
  on making it easier than ever to build and run reliable data-backed applications
  on DigitalOcean. In this recap, we’ll walk through the most impactful launches in
  both the first and second half of the year and how they help teams move faster while
  keeping complexity low. First, let’s take a look at our releases in the first half
  of the year (H1) : – Managed PostgreSQL support for v17 [February] – Managed MongoDB
  support for v8 [March] – Support for up to 20TB for Managed MySQL and 30TB for PostgreSQL
  [March] – Introducing DigitalOcean Managed Caching for Valkey [April] – Introducing
  Role-Based Access Control to DigitalOcean Managed MongoDB with Predefined Roles
  [May] – Database Observability, Monitoring, and Hardening Advancements [June] –
  Support for Kafka Schema Registry [July] The second half (H2) of 2025 saw even more
  big developments for DigitalOcean Managed Databases: The DigitalOcean MCP (Model
  Context Protocol) Server lets you manage your cloud resources using simple, natural-language
  commands through AI-powered tools like Cursor, Claude, or your own custom LLMs.
  Running locally, it streamlines tasks such as provisioning Managed Databases, making
  cloud operations faster, easier, and more intuitive for developers. DigitalOcean
  MCP Server marks a major step forward in bringing AI directly into cloud infrastructure
  workflows. It allows users to seamlessly integrate cloud management into AI assistants
  or custom-built agents while eliminating context switching, manual API calls, and
  constant console navigation. MCP Servers make managing cloud infrastructure with
  LLMs faster, more secure, and far more accessible. We introduced advanced configuration
  options in the Managed Databases UI, giving developers more control without needing
  API calls or manual setup. With this update, you can fine-tune performance settings,
  customize connection parameters, and tailor your database environment directly from
  the dashboard. It’s a faster, more intuitive way to optimize your databases for
  your specific workloads. Launched at our Deploy conference in London, this feature
  marks another major milestone for automation in database environments.'
