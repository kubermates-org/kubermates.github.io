summary: "By Nicole Ghalwash As your applications scale, keeping a close eye on them\
  \ becomes more important than everâ\x80\x93it also becomes harder the more data\
  \ you have. Thatâ\x80\x99s why weâ\x80\x99re pleased to announce that we have made\
  \ several new observability, monitoring, and hardening advancements to DigitalOcean\
  \ Managed Databasesâ\x80\x93to give you better visibility, understanding, and peace\
  \ of mind. To be exact, we have made three advancements that will improve your Managed\
  \ Database observability experience here at DigitalOcean. Letâ\x80\x99s walk through\
  \ all three of them. DigitalOcean Managed Databases now supports log forwarding\
  \ to Datadog , enabling seamless integration to your existing Datadog observability\
  \ dashboard. You can now send, view, and analyze your Managed Database logs directly\
  \ within Datadog. This feature will enhance your overall observability and monitoring.\
  \ Key features of this integration include: Direct log forwarding: This feature\
  \ automatically pushes your database service logs to Datadogâ\x80\x99s log intake\
  \ endpoints, eliminating the need to manage a separate log collection agent. By\
  \ automating log forwarding, you no longer have to worry about deploying, managing,\
  \ or scaling additional logging agents, which helps to reduce operational complexity.\
  \ UI-based configuration: The integration is fully configurable through the management\
  \ console, allowing you to set it up for most database types directly within the\
  \ log forwarding section. UI-based configuration simplifies the setup process and\
  \ consolidates your database logs with application and infrastructure telemetry,\
  \ improving visibility and monitoringâ\x80\x94all without the need for managing\
  \ separate agents. Customizable log templates: The Datadog log template can be customized\
  \ per database, enabling specific log details or filtering to suit your needs."
