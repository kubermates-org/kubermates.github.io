  \ Managed Databasesâ\x80\x93to give you better visibility, understanding, and peace\
  \ of mind. To be exact, we have made three advancements that will improve your Managed\
  \ Database observability experience here at DigitalOcean. Letâ\x80\x99s walk through\
  \ all three of them. DigitalOcean Managed Databases now supports log forwarding\
  \ to Datadog , enabling seamless integration to your existing Datadog observability\
  \ dashboard. You can now send, view, and analyze your Managed Database logs directly\
  \ within Datadog. This feature will enhance your overall observability and monitoring.\
  \ Key features of this integration include: Direct log forwarding: This feature\
  \ automatically pushes your database service logs to Datadogâ\x80\x99s log intake\
  \ endpoints, eliminating the need to manage a separate log collection agent. By\
  \ automating log forwarding, you no longer have to worry about deploying, managing,\
  \ or scaling additional logging agents, which helps to reduce operational complexity.\
