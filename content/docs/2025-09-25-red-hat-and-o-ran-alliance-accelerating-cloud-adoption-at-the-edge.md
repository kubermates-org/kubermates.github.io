  Virtualization Share In telecommunication, bringing compute resources and intelligence
  closer to users improves the user experience, significantly reduces service provider
  costs, and unlocks the innovation needed to deliver compelling services that increase
  revenue. However, telecommunication service providers are faced with challenges
  when adopting new technologies, methodologies, and automation. Every option must
  be evaluated for compatibility with a radio access network (RAN). Solving these
  challenges are the reasons Red Hat has been collaborating and contributing to the
  O-RAN Alliance. Red Hat is committed to advancing the open radio access network
  (O-RAN) ecosystem through contributions to open source projects, and industry collaboration.
  Red Hat is collaborating on critical O-RAN interfaces, fostering a robust hardware
  partner ecosystem, working with service management and orchestration (SMO) providers,
  and making ongoing contributions to vital open source O-RAN initiatives. These contributions,
  of course, all end up in Red Hat's cloud-native products. Red Hat's O-RAN strategy
  is built on four core principles, all underpinned by open source collaboration.
  Adoption of cloud-native methodology drives down operational costs and increases
  reliability of deployment and ongoing management of O-RAN clusters for thousands
  of nodes at the edge. Cloud-native server clusters span from service provider IT
  systems, the core, and now to the edge. With AI becoming a part of many deployments,
  cloud-native principles are more important than ever. Adoption of cloud-native principles
  in the service provider market has been a challenge, and is a barrier to lower operational
  expenditure (OpEx).
