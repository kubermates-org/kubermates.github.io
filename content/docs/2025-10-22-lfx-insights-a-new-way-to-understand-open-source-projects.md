  Ricardo Rocha, Cern Open source forms the backbone of modern technology ecosystems.
  From orchestration and observability to frameworks and developer tools, today’s
  technology choices depend on projects we may not control but rely on every day.
  The challenge: not all projects are equal. Some are maintained by large, diverse
  contributor bases. Others hinge on a handful of individuals. Some projects are responsive
  to security issues, while others leave risks unaddressed. Until now, it has been
  hard to see which projects are truly healthy. That’s the gap LFX Insights is built
  to close. ​​LFX Insights, developed by the Linux Foundation, helps organizations
  make informed decisions about the open source projects they depend on. Instead of
  relying on surface-level metrics like GitHub stars, Insights helps you answer deeper
  questions such as: Is this project actively maintained? Is there a healthy mix of
  contributors and organizations? How quickly are issues and pull requests being resolved?
  Does the project follow good security and governance practices? It gives you the
  information you need to select, adopt, and invest in open source projects with confidence.
  End users carry real risk when dependencies aren’t healthy. We’ve all seen the consequences:
  left-pad’s removal, the Log4Shell vulnerability, or the recent XZ backdoor attempt.'
