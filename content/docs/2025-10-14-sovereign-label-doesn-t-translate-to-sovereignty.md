  Cloud Beyond the Data Center: The True Scope of VMware Cloud Foundation In 2022,
  VMware warned that sovereignty depended on the needs of the customer , more than
  marketing, more than a logo on a cloud product. At the time, it felt early. Now,
  the evidence is undeniable: hearings, regulatory framework being prioritized , and
  market pivots prove that what mattered then matters even more now. Sovereignty has
  gone from an abstract concept to a key customer consideration. Establishing a compliance
  requirement around sovereignty is becoming a key discussion point in Europe. This
  blog builds on that foundation. We’ll examine why “sovereign by label” clouds fall
  short, point to real market signals that expose the gap, and lay out a practical
  checklist that buyers — and vendors — should demand. Because in 2025, the conversation
  is no longer about who can market sovereignty, but who can prove it. *** Many traditional
  public cloud vendors now sell “sovereign” clouds. But a label and local data centers
  do not erase legal exposure, control-plane dependencies, or auditability gaps. Recent
  admissions and market moves show the problem : when push comes to shove, control,
  whether in the form of jurisdiction or on data flows matters more than a marketing
  name. Let’s unpack the different aspects of this reality, point to concrete market
  signals, and discuss a practical checklist that buyers and platform vendors should
  demand if they mean “sovereign” in anything but name only.'
