summary: 'If you don’t understand what is Software Bill of Materials (SBOM), please
  read this blog post first. The National Telecommunications and Information Administration
  (NTIA) in the U. S. defined minimum requirements for SBOM formats : In this section,
  we discuss different kinds and formats for SBOM standards and make a brief comparison
  between them. Three commonly used standards achieved the NTIA minimum requirements
  for SBOM generation and each one results in a different final SBOM document. History:
  SPDX is an open-source machine-readable format adopted by the Linux Foundation as
  an industry standard. The specifications are implemented as a file format that identifies
  the software components within a larger piece of computer software and fulfilling
  the requirements of NTIA. The SPDX project started in 2010 and was initially dedicated
  to solving the issues around open source licensing compliance. It evolved over the
  years to adhere supply chain security challenges and has seen extensive uptake by
  companies and projects in the software industry. Companies like Hitachi, Fujitsu,
  and Toshiba contributed to furthering the standard in the SPDX v2. 2. 2 specification
  release.'
