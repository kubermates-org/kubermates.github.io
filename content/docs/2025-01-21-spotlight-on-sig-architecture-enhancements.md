summary: 'Spotlight on SIG Architecture: Enhancements The Enhancements subproject
  The KEP and its impact Current areas of focus Getting involved This is the fourth
  interview of a SIG Architecture Spotlight series that will cover the different subprojects,
  and we will be covering SIG Architecture: Enhancements. In this SIG Architecture
  spotlight we talked with Kirsten Garrison , lead of the Enhancements subproject.
  Frederico (FSM): Hi Kirsten, very happy to have the opportunity to talk about the
  Enhancements subproject. Let''s start with some quick information about yourself
  and your role. Kirsten Garrison (KG) : I’m a lead of the Enhancements subproject
  of SIG-Architecture and currently work at Google. I first got involved by contributing
  to the service-catalog project with the help of Carolyn Van Slyck. With time, I
  joined the Release team , eventually becoming the Enhancements Lead and a Release
  Lead shadow. While on the release team, I worked on some ideas to make the process
  better for the SIGs and Enhancements team (the opt-in process) based on my team’s
  experiences. Eventually, I started attending Subproject meetings and contributing
  to the Subproject’s work. FSM: You mentioned the Enhancements subproject: how would
  you describe its main goals and areas of intervention? KG : The Enhancements Subproject
  primarily concerns itself with the Kubernetes Enhancement Proposal ( KEP for short)—the
  "design" documents required for all features and significant changes to the Kubernetes
  project. FSM: The improvement of the KEP process was (and is) one in which SIG Architecture
  was heavily involved. Could you explain the process to those that aren’t aware of
  it? KG : Every release , the SIGs let the Release Team know which features they
  intend to work on to be put into the release.'
