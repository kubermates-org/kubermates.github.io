  \ Today, weâ\x80\x99re excited to announce the general availability of DO API support\
  \ for per-bucket access keys, mixed permissions support for per-bucket access keys,\
  \ and the public preview of Spaces access logs, delivering greater automation, visibility,\
  \ and security to DigitalOcean Spaces object storage. Building on the success of\
  \ per-bucket access keys, weâ\x80\x99re introducing two major upgrades that are\
  \ now generally available to all customers to streamline storage access management:\
  \ DO API support for managing access keys â\x80\x93 Manage Spaces access keys programmatically\
  \ using the DigitalOcean API, enabling automation through the DigitalOcean Terraform\
  \ Provider, doctl CLI, DigitalOcean Go API Client (godo), and DigitalOceanâ\x80\x99\
  s Python library (PyDo). DO API support for managing access keys â\x80\x93 Manage\
  \ Spaces access keys programmatically using the DigitalOcean API, enabling automation\
  \ through the DigitalOcean Terraform Provider, doctl CLI, DigitalOcean Go API Client\
  \ (godo), and DigitalOceanâ\x80\x99s Python library (PyDo). More granular access\
  \ control â\x80\x93 A single access key can now be configured with permissions that\
  \ vary by bucket. This lets you grant read-only permissions for some buckets and\
  \ read-write permissions for other buckets to a single person or application. More\
  \ granular access control â\x80\x93 A single access key can now be configured with\
  \ permissions that vary by bucket. This lets you grant read-only permissions for\
  \ some buckets and read-write permissions for other buckets to a single person or\
  \ application. These enhancements simplify storage management for customers handling\
  \ large-scale deployments, automated backups, and security-driven workflows. Explore\
  \ the documentation to use DO API and manage mixed-permissions access keys. You\
  \ can start using these new features right now. Spaces access logs are now available\
  \ in public preview to provide detailed records of read and write requests to your\
  \ Spaces buckets, helping you to better understand usage and enhance security."
