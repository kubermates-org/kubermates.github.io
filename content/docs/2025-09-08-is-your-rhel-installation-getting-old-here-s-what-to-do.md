  Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) is the enterprise platform for mission-critical workloads
  and it allows companies across the globe to run their businesses in a secure, reliable
  and supported way. But running an outdated version of any operating system can expose
  your organization to security risks and prevent you from leveraging the latest features
  and performance improvements. We know it can sometimes be challenging and time-consuming
  to stay updated, so in this article I explain the RHEL lifecycle , the importance
  of staying current, and your options for upgrading. Every version of RHEL has a
  lifecycle that defines the level of support it receives over time. We can easily
  summarize its lifecycle as divided into three main phases: Full support phase: During
  this phase, your RHEL system receives all security updates, bug fixes, and new features.
  This is the ideal phase for your production systems to be in. Maintenance support
  phase: In this phase, Red Hat provides critical and important security updates and
  urgent bug fixes. However, during maintenance support, no new features or hardware
  enablement are provided. Extended life phase (ELP): After the maintenance support
  phase, your RHEL version enters the extended life phase. During this time, you have
  access to a limited set of software maintenance services. RHEL is used in a diverse
  range of environments, asd sometimes there are specific scenarios that require special
  attention. For example, you may be involved with: Third-party software vendors certifying
  and supporting specific RHEL minor versions.'
