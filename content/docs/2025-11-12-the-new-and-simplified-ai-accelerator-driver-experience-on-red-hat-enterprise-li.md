  Edge computing Infrastructure Applications Virtualization Share Many existing and
  popular workloads are getting infused and enhanced with AI, and there will likely
  emerge a new wave of AI applications in the future. This has led to the increasing
  importance of AI accelerators, including graphics processing units (GPU) and custom
  training and inference engines. From discrete GPUs to AI acceleration integrated
  on-die with the traditional CPU, it''s clear that specialized, accelerated hardware
  is required to provide the performance needed to develop and deploy tomorrow''s
  workloads. That''s why we''re announcing a new, simplified AI accelerator driver
  experience on Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL). Whether you''re a developer building
  the next ground-breaking AI application, or an IT systems administrator provisioning
  servers to deploy AI workloads, RHEL provides a seamless experience to get accelerated
  systems up and running. You can now acquire AI accelerator drivers from NVIDIA and
  AMD from Red Hat repositories, built and signed by Red Hat using secure software
  supply chain practices and Secure Boot technologies. In just one command, you can
  install the latest available accelerator drivers. Historically, installing and maintaining
  GPU accelerator drivers with enterprise-grade Linux distributions has presented
  a unique set of challenges.'
