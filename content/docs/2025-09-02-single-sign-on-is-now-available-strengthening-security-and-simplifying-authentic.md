  \ forward in strengthening security, simplifying user management, and empowering\
  \ teams to be more productive on DigitalOcean. For growing teams, managing user\
  \ accounts across multiple platforms can quickly become a challenge. Password resets,\
  \ manual onboarding, and offboarding all add up, not just for the IT teamâ\x80\x93\
  but developers feel it too in terms of lost productivity. That means: No more juggling\
  \ multiple usernames and passwords. No more juggling multiple usernames and passwords.\
  \ Centralized access management that scales with your team. No more wasting time\
  \ being locked out of critical apps. Stronger, consistent security across your entire\
  \ toolchain. As organizations grow, managing user access across multiple tools and\
  \ platforms can become complex, time-consuming, and costly. Single Sign-On solves\
  \ this problem by allowing employees to securely access all their applications with\
  \ a single set of credentials. By centralizing authentication, SSO not only strengthens\
  \ security but also streamlines onboarding, reduces IT workload, and gives teams\
  \ a seamless login experience that helps them stay focused on building and innovating."
