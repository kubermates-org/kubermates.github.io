  Edge computing Infrastructure Applications Virtualization Share Last month, we launched
  Red Hat Ansible Automation Platform 2.6, and introduced several new features including
  an automation dashboard, a self-service automation portal, and the Ansible Lightspeed
  intelligent assistant. We hosted a follow-up webinar, What’s new with Ansible Automation
  Platform 2.6 , during which we received some great questions from the audience about
  how to install, migrate, and upgrade to the latest version. To help you prepare
  for and navigate the Ansible Automation Platform 2.6 release, we''ve compiled the
  top questions and their answers. Starting at the beginning, here are some common
  questions and answers about the initial setup of Ansible Automation Platform, whether
  you''re trying it for the first time or just updating to the latest version. Is
  there documentation for installing or migrating to Ansible Automation Platform 2.6?
  Red Hat''s official product documentation for Ansible Automation Platform 2.6 provides
  an installation guide to help you get up and running. If you''re migrating a previous
  install to the latest version, read our 2.6 migration documentation. For a quick
  overview of the process, read this installation and upgrade blog. When moving from
  using RPM to containerized installations, do I need three separate VMs for service
  containers (automation controller, database, and automation hub)? Yes, we still
  recommend having one VM instance for each service container. See the installation
  and migration guides above. There are additional changes, so be sure to review the
  tested deployment models. Can I upgrade or migrate 2.4 (RPM) on host A to 2.6 (containerized)
  on host B? First upgrade to 2.6, then migrate to the containerized installation.
  Is a database with high availability (HA) available in Ansible Automation Platform
  2.6? Red Hat does not provide HA solutions.'
