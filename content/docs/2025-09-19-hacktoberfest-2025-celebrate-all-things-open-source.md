  \ , and now is the time to prepare yourself for a month filled with open-source\
  \ contribution, collaboration, and fun! Hacktoberfest is our month-long celebration\
  \ of all things open source that kicks off on October 1. Each year, maintainers\
  \ and contributors come together to contribute to the open-source projects that\
  \ many individual maintainers, companies (including DigitalOcean), and builders\
  \ of every skill level rely on. In the 12 years since its inception, Hacktoberfest\
  \ has exploded from a group of just 676 contributors to a global open-source phenomenon,\
  \ with over 90,000 participants last year across the globe. Thatâ\x80\x99s a lot\
  \ of love for open source! Hacktoberfest challenges you to support open-source projects\
  \ by creating 6 pull or merge requests that project maintainers accept during October.\
  \ Weâ\x80\x99re doing awards a little differently this year and bringing back t-shirts!\
  \ If youâ\x80\x99re among the first 10,000 contributors to complete 6 PRs, you will\
  \ receive an official Hacktoberfest 2025 t-shirt and have a tree planted in your\
  \ name. Weâ\x80\x99re also partnering with Holopin this year to share the open-source\
  \ love digitally. The mascot for this year is Hackstronaut, and all you have to\
  \ do to get your first Hackstronaut pin is register! As you complete each PR, your\
  \ pin will move up through different levels, so keep an eye on your inbox to claim\
  \ them. Starting today, visit Hacktoberfest. com to get excited about making your\
  \ contributions or prepare your project to receive some. Also, mark your calendar\
  \ for the virtual kickoff event on October 1. The Hacktoberfest website has all\
  \ the information you need to get started."
