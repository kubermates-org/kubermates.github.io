  from a recent conversation I had with University of California, Berkeley’s Ion Stoica,
  featured in Red Hat Research Quarterly’s article, From silos to startups: Why universities
  must be a part of industry’s AI growth. Read our full conversation here. For the
  last several years, the narrative around artificial intelligence (AI) has been dominated
  by large language models (LLMs) and the monumental effort of training them. The
  technology industry has been focused on the discovery phase—but that era is rapidly
  shifting. The conversation is moving from, "How do we build the model?" to, "How
  do we actually run the model in production at scale?" This shift is more than a
  technical detail; it’s the new center of gravity for enterprise AI. When AI leaves
  the research lab and becomes a core business capability, the focus lands squarely
  on inference—the firing synapses in a trained model’s “brain” before it generates
  an answer or takes action. And in the enterprise, inference must be fast, cost-effective,
  and fully controlled. Moving AI from a proof-of-concept into a reliable, production-grade
  service introduces significant complexity, cost, and control challenges for IT leaders.
  Firstly, the hardware required to run these models—especially at the scale the enterprise
  needs—is expensive and often scarce. Secondly, demand is unpredictable. You might
  have bursts of high usage followed by long periods of low activity, which can be
  compounded across hundreds of variants of domain-purposed models. This variability
  makes it extremely difficult to maximize resource utilization and protect those
  critical investments.'
