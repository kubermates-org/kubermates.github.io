summary: 'Ingress NGINX Retirement: What You Need to Know About Ingress NGINX History
  and Challenges Current State and Next Steps To prioritize the safety and security
  of the ecosystem, Kubernetes SIG Network and the Security Response Committee are
  announcing the upcoming retirement of Ingress NGINX. Best-effort maintenance will
  continue until March 2026. Afterward, there will be no further releases, no bugfixes,
  and no updates to resolve any security vulnerabilities that may be discovered. Existing
  deployments of Ingress NGINX will continue to function and installation artifacts
  will remain available. We recommend migrating to one of the many alternatives. Consider
  migrating to Gateway API , the modern replacement for Ingress. If you must continue
  using Ingress, many alternative Ingress controllers are listed in the Kubernetes
  documentation. Continue reading for further information about the history and current
  state of Ingress NGINX, as well as next steps. Ingress is the original user-friendly
  way to direct network traffic to workloads running on Kubernetes. ( Gateway API
  is a newer way to achieve many of the same goals. ) In order for an Ingress to work
  in your cluster, there must be an Ingress controller running. There are many Ingress
  controller choices available, which serve the needs of different users and use cases.'
