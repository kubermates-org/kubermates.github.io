  Engineering Summary Next Steps Modern cloud-native organizations rely on two critical
  disciplines to achieve operational excellence — Site Reliability Engineering (SRE)
  and Platform Engineering. While both roles share a focus on automation, reliability,
  and scalability, their core missions, tools, and metrics for success differ. With
  the rise of AI-assisted infrastructure management, these roles are converging faster
  than ever. SREs ensure system reliability, performance, and uptime through automation
  and incident management. Platform Engineers build self-service, secure, and compliant
  platforms that empower developers to deploy applications efficiently. SREs focus
  on maintaining system reliability and meeting SLAs, while Platform Engineers enable
  developers with secure, reusable, and automated workflows. SREs measure success
  through uptime and error budgets, while Platform Engineers focus on developer productivity
  and compliance consistency. SREs rely on Prometheus , Grafana , PagerDuty , and
  ChaosMesh for observability and incident response. Platform Engineers leverage ArgoCD
  , Kyverno , Terraform , and Nirmata Control Hub for automation, governance, and
  Policy-as-Code enforcement. SREs specialize in observability, capacity planning,
  and performance optimization, while Platform Engineers focus on building Internal
  Developer Platforms (IDPs), enforcing security policies, and managing infrastructure-as-code.
  Startups often employ hybrid DevOps or SRE roles. Mid-size SaaS companies need Platform
  Engineers to standardize deployments and policies.'
