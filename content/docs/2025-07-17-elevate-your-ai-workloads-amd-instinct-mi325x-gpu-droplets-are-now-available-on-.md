summary: "By Waverly Swinton At DigitalOcean, weâ\x80\x99re constantly striving to\
  \ equip developers and digital native enterprises with the most powerful and accessible\
  \ tools to fuel AI innovation. Following the introduction of our AMD Instinctâ\x84\
  ¢ MI300X GPU Droplets last month, weâ\x80\x99re thrilled to announce the availability\
  \ of the next generation of AI accelerators - AMD Instinctâ\x84¢ MI325X. Built on\
  \ the advanced AMD CDNAâ\x84¢ 3 architecture, the AMD Instinctâ\x84¢ MI325X accelerators\
  \ are engineered to deliver exceptional performance for AI workloads, including\
  \ large model training, fine-tuning, inference, and high-performance computing (HPC).\
  \ These GPUs are available as GradientAI GPU Droplets , powerful virtual machines\
  \ with a simplified setup. Key benefits of the AMD Instinctâ\x84¢ MI325X that enable\
  \ you to accelerate complex computations, ensure your inference tasks run faster,\
  \ and provide more flexibility and control: Memory capacity and bandwidth : With\
  \ 256GB of HBM3E memory and 6. 0TB/s of bandwidth, the MI325X can hold massive models\
  \ entirely in memory, significantly reducing the need for model splitting across\
  \ GPUs and accelerating complex computations. This represents a substantial leap\
  \ in memory capabilities, offering 1. 8x more capacity and 1. 3x more bandwidth\
  \ compared to previous generations. Accelerated AI inference performance : The MI325X\
  \ boasts 1. 3x greater peak theoretical FP16 and FP8 compute performance than competing\
  \ solutions, ensuring your AI models run faster and more efficiently, especially\
  \ for inference tasks. ROCmâ\x84¢ Software Platform : The MI325X fully leverages\
  \ the AMD ROCmâ\x84¢ open software platform, enabling developers to build and deploy\
  \ powerful HPC and AI systems."
