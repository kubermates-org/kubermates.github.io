  \ advanced AMD CDNAâ\x84¢ 3 architecture, the AMD Instinctâ\x84¢ MI325X accelerators\
  \ are engineered to deliver exceptional performance for AI workloads, including\
  \ large model training, fine-tuning, inference, and high-performance computing (HPC).\
  \ These GPUs are available as GradientAI GPU Droplets , powerful virtual machines\
  \ with a simplified setup. Key benefits of the AMD Instinctâ\x84¢ MI325X that enable\
  \ you to accelerate complex computations, ensure your inference tasks run faster,\
  \ and provide more flexibility and control: Memory capacity and bandwidth : With\
  \ 256GB of HBM3E memory and 6. 0TB/s of bandwidth, the MI325X can hold massive models\
  \ entirely in memory, significantly reducing the need for model splitting across\
  \ GPUs and accelerating complex computations. This represents a substantial leap\
  \ in memory capabilities, offering 1. 8x more capacity and 1. 3x more bandwidth\
  \ compared to previous generations. Memory capacity and bandwidth : With 256GB of\
