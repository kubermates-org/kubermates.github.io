  Research This blog is the third in our series, “Effective platform engineering:
  Priorities, pitfalls and success in taming complexity and managing today’s enterprise
  infrastructure and applications” (read the first blog and second blog ) and a companion
  to the analyst report, “ Cost, Productivity, Security Shape Today’s Platform Engineering.
  ” The evolution of DevSecOps DevSecOps, the collaboration among security and software
  development/DevOps/platform engineering teams, continues to evolve as practices
  and tools mature. However, many organizations remain stuck in siloed approaches
  that pose problems due to competing demands for speed, efficiency and risk reduction.
  Enterprises that effectively integrate security into software development and deployment—both
  through platforms and tools, and via cross-team collaboration— are better positioned
  to drive velocity, quality and innovation while maintaining and even improving security.
  Security represents a significant challenge for DevOps and platform engineering
  teams as they seek to “shift left” and integrate security earlier in the software
  development process and through deployment. While security elements, such as vulnerability
  assessment, application security testing and source code analysis, are increasingly
  integrated into software development and deployment, our survey results indicate
  that more than a third of enterprises still lack collaboration among security and
  DevOps/platform engineering teams. DevSecOps collaboration entails both organizational
  and technical hurdles as security initiatives are increasingly driven by non-security
  teams. Platforms and tools must be integrated and automated to avoid constraining
  developers and other stakeholders. In addition, today’s enterprise IT environment
  demands multi-layered security measures that can help boost software quality while
  also reducing risk. Overcoming DevSecOps hurdles The most common DevSecOps pain
  points cited by survey respondents are rapidly evolving regulatory and compliance
  requirements (37%), an excessive volume of security alerts (35%) and security validation
  causing too much friction in the development process (33%) (see figure below). Current
  pain points in DevSecOps Q: What are the current pain points in DevSecOps? Please
  select all that apply. Base: Respondents whose organization has DevOps in use or
  in discovery/proof of concept (n=403).'
