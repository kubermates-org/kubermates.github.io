summary: The Journey to Kubeflow Spark Operator Why Kubeflow? What’s Next? Join the
  Movement We’re excited to announce the migration of Google’s Spark Operator to the
  Kubeflow Spark Operator , marking the launch of a significant addition to the Kubeflow
  ecosystem. The Kubeflow Spark Operator simplifies the deployment and management
  of Apache Spark applications on Kubernetes. This announcement isn’t just about a
  new piece of technology, it’s about building a stronger, open-governed, and more
  collaborative community around Spark on Kubernetes. The journey of the Kubeflow
  Spark Operator began with Google Cloud Platform’s Spark on Kubernetes Operator (https://cloud.
  google. com/blog/products/data-analytics/data-analytics-meet-containers-kubernetes-operator-for-apache-spark-now-in-beta).
  With over 2. 3k stars and 1. 3k forks on GitHub, this project laid the foundation
  for a robust Spark on Kubernetes experience, enabling users to deploy Spark workloads
  seamlessly across Kubernetes clusters. Growth and innovation require not just code
  but also community. Acknowledging the resource and time limitations faced by Google
  Cloud’s original maintainers, Kubeflow has taken up the mantle. This transition
  is not merely administrative but a strategic move towards fostering a vibrant, diverse,
  and more actively engaged community.
