summary: "By Nicole Ghalwash Good news for growing businesses and folks with data-intensive\
  \ applications: weâ\x80\x99re excited to introduce 100% larger storage plans for\
  \ both Managed MySQL and PostgreSQL in select regions. Starting today, Managed MySQL\
  \ storage has doubled to 20TB, and Managed PostgreSQL now supports up to 30TB, up\
  \ from 15TB. These expanded storage options are available in Singapore (SGP1), San\
  \ Francisco (SFO2), and Frankfurt (FRA1), with plans to roll out to more regions\
  \ later this year. Now users have even more flexibility to scale seamlessly, whether\
  \ growing existing workloads or migrating from self-managed databases. With DigitalOceanâ\x80\
  \x99s fully managed service, you get the performance, security, and simplicity you\
  \ needâ\x80\x94without the operational burden. Scaling your databases is now easier\
  \ than ever, helping to ensure your infrastructure keeps pace with your business\
  \ growth. As your businesses grow, so do data storage requirements. Our expanded,\
  \ scalable storage options allow you to: Big databases, no worries: Support large\
  \ databases with up to 20TB and 30TB of scalable storage. Control both performance\
  \ and costs: Scale storage independently of CPU and memory, giving you the flexibility\
  \ to adapt as your workload evolves. This ensures you pay only for what you need\
  \ while avoiding over- or under-provisioning resources. Migrate like magic: Move\
  \ from self-managed databases on Droplets or other cloud providers to DigitalOcean\
  \ Managed Databases without storage constraints. Every business and every developer\
  \ managing large-scale applications, analytics platforms, e-commerce sites, and\
  \ any other workload requiring lots of storage capacity."
