  Virtualization Share Successfully delivering automation demands technical excellence,
  quality code, and reliable execution. However, scaling this success requires translating
  those technical wins into measurable business impact that can be communicated to
  leadership or integrated into business strategy. Red Hat Ansible Automation Platform
  offers two different capabilities that help practitioners and leaders turn operational
  metrics into a clear, auditable business case for expansion: Automation dashboard
  and automation analytics. The automation dashboard provides a comprehensive view
  of automation performance, enabling you to measure and demonstrate the value of
  your initiatives. Through the on-premise dashboard, you gain detailed insights into
  automation usage, job outcomes, and associated financial impact. Key metrics such
  as job success rates, time savings, and return on investment (ROI) support data-driven
  decision-making and help identify opportunities to scale automation effectively.
  With robust customization and reporting capabilities, you can filter, save, export,
  and share detailed analyses on project performance, user activity, and operational
  efficiency. Reports can be exported as PDF files for a quick snapshot of the dashboard
  showing metrics such as cost and time savings, job success and failure rates, and
  total hours of automation. For deeper analysis, data can also be exported as CSV
  files and ingested into existing business intelligence (BI) tools to enable detailed
  reporting. Because the dashboard is a self-contained, on-premise utility, all data
  remains securely within your environment. It can aggregate data from multiple Ansible
  Automation Platform instances and is accessible directly in the Ansible interface
  for system_admin and system_auditor accounts. This makes it ideal when data security
  is a priority, and when you want local, real-time visibility in your automation
  performance.'
