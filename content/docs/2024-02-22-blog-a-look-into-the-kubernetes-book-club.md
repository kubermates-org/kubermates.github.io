tldr: Learning Kubernetes and the entire ecosystem of technologies around it is not
  without its challenges. In this interview, we will talk with Carlos Santana (AWS)

summary: 'Learning Kubernetes and the entire ecosystem of technologies around it is
  not without its challenges. In this interview, we will talk with Carlos Santana
  (AWS) to learn a bit more about how he created the Kubernetes Book Club , how it
  works, and how anyone can join in to take advantage of a community-based learning
  experience. Frederico Muñoz (FSM) : Hello Carlos, thank you so much for your availability.
  To start with, could you tell us a bit about yourself? Carlos Santana (CS) : Of
  course. My experience in deploying Kubernetes in production six years ago opened
  the door for me to join Knative and then contribute to Kubernetes through the Release
  Team. Working on upstream Kubernetes has been one of the best experiences I’ve had
  in open-source. Over the past two years, in my role as a Senior Specialist Solutions
  Architect at AWS, I have been assisting large enterprises build their internal developer
  platforms (IDP) on top of Kubernetes. Going forward, my open source contributions
  are directed towards CNOE and CNCF projects like Argo , Crossplane , and Backstage.
  FSM : So your path led you to Kubernetes, and at that point what was the motivating
  factor for starting the Book Club? CS : The idea for the Kubernetes Book Club sprang
  from a casual suggestion during a TGIK livestream. For me, it was more than just
  about reading a book; it was about creating a learning community. This platform
  has not only been a source of knowledge but also a support system, especially during
  the challenging times of the pandemic. It’s gratifying to see how this initiative
  has helped members cope and grow.'
