summary: 'From Chaos to Control: Achieving Network Policy Nirvana with Kyverno The
  Challenge: The Manual Toil of Network Policies The Solution: Kyverno for Guardrails
  and Automation Key Insights from the Live Demo Conclusion: Empowering Platform Teams
  At the recent Kubernetes Community Days (KCD) in San Francisco, Jim Bugwadia, co-founder
  of Nirmata and a maintainer of the CNCF project Kyverno, delivered a session on
  one of the most persistent challenges in platform engineering: the balancing act
  between developer agility and robust security. His talk, “Network Policy Nirvana,”
  provided a clear roadmap for taming the complexity of Kubernetes network security
  through automation and policy-as-code. Jim began by framing the core problem. Platform
  teams are constantly caught between two competing needs: Developers require self-service
  and agility to ship features quickly. Security and compliance teams require guardrails
  and control to protect the platform. Nowhere is this tension more apparent than
  with Kubernetes Network Policies. While essential for security, native Network Policies
  can be complex, error-prone, and difficult to manage at scale. By default, Kubernetes
  allows all pods to talk to each other, so securing a cluster requires a “deny-by-default”
  stance, which can be difficult to implement manually. This leads to several pain
  points: Complexity: Managing countless YAML files for different applications is
  prone to error. Lack of Automation: Manual policy review creates bottlenecks and
  slows down development. Security Gaps: Misconfigurations can easily lead to unintended
  security vulnerabilities. Jim introduced Kyverno , a policy engine built for Kubernetes,
  as the solution.'
