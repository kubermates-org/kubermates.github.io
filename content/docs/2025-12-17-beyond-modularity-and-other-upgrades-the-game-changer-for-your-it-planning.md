  Security Edge computing Infrastructure Applications Virtualization Share Scott and
  I talk to a lot of customers, and one theme that comes up over and over is that
  it’s difficult to plan for future releases of Linux. Sometimes, support drops for
  a feature or capability on which they rely. Other times, it’s that they can’t wait
  for a new feature, bug fix, and so on. Planning for Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL)
  with its built-in digital roadmap, powered by Red Hat Lightspeed, is changing that.
  Product managers within RHEL now communicate directly with you about upcoming changes
  in the code base. This gives you more time to plan for changes, as well as clearer
  information about what’s changing. This simplifies upgrades and helps inform the
  automation your teams are building for the platform. Executing on this vision, we
  are eager to announce our first planned change to the next major version of RHEL:
  Removal of support for modularity in RHEL 11! This update excites RHEL product managers,
  who work tirelessly to keep feature roadmaps perfectly updated for customers, partners,
  and Red Hat engineers alike, but many readers may find this a curious announcement.
  Read on to better understand why it''s so exciting. Since the launch of RHEL in
  2002, there has been an ongoing challenge to enable the multitude of developer applications,
  languages, and tools, as well as their differing versions function seamlessly together
  on a stable, enterprise-grade operating system. Initial workarounds include providing
  one-version-only support at each major OS release, or in 2013 introducing Red Hat
  Software Collections to allow for newer versioned applications to be installed in
  isolated directories. Given a developer''s need for modern software versions before
  a major OS upgrade, on top of the tediousness of hard-isolating every newly updated
  application, a core versioning strategy was needed for RHEL to succeed.'
