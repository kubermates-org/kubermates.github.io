  and Senior Technical Advocate at Datadog TL;DR: GenAI can help you write conference
  abstracts, but if you use it without injecting your own curiosity and humanness,
  reviewers can tell. This post walks through my personal process for co-writing abstracts
  with GenAI in a way that preserves my voice and experience. I developed this process
  for technical talks, but it adapts well to other formats too. I’ve spoken at a lot
  of conferences, big and small. I’ve given keynotes. Breakouts. Workshops. I’ve been
  around the block and written many conference talk proposals. I’ve also been on program
  committees and reviewed others’ proposals. There’s always room for improvement,
  but I like to think I know what good is. In my view, here are some elements of a
  good talk proposal: – A clear, engaging idea (or a run-of-the-mill idea with a compelling
  angle) – Some clear details about the talk, like concrete examples or stories, or
  talk format and tools covered – Clear audience – Clear takeaways As you can imagine,
  the widespread use of GenAI to generate talk proposals has changed the game for
  both submitters and reviewers. As a submitter, you can type just one line into ChatGPT,
  for example: Write me a KubeCon + CloudNativeCon talk abstract on Validating Admission
  Policy And it produces something that, on the surface, looks pretty good!* Title:
  Enforcing What Matters: Building Safer Kubernetes with Validating Admission Policies
  Abstract: As Kubernetes adoption continues to grow across organizations, ensuring
  workloads meet security, compliance, and operational standards before hitting the
  cluster is more critical than ever.'
