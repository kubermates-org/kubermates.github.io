  Edge computing Infrastructure Applications Virtualization Share The utility industry
  is currently facing a multitude of hurdles that are driven by a combination of aging
  infrastructure, changing energy landscape and evolving customer expectations. The
  power grid, specifically, is undergoing its greatest transformation since inception,
  with new challenges imposing problems that our grid is not equipped to handle. As
  utilities adopt a software-defined infrastructure,bringing IT best practices to
  OT ecosystems becomes increasingly feasible. By virtualizing applications and taking
  advantage of advancements in edge computing platforms and AI, utilities can modernize
  infrastructure and create more agile, software-defined environments that improve
  everything from operational efficiency to smart grid responsiveness. Through collaboration
  and open innovation, Red Hat is helping organizations modernize, virtualize and
  bridge the gap between IT and OT for smarter, more efficient operations. We are
  excited to share that Red Hat has officially joined the LF Energy community, a community
  for collaboration on open industrial-grade technology platforms and agile specifications
  for the energy transition, to help facilitate a more efficient energy grid. Red
  Hat and LF Energy LF Energy is the premier community for collaboration on open industrial-grade
  technology platforms and agile standards for the digital energy transition. It is
  a community of digital experts at leading utilities, vendors, and supporters who
  are willing to rethink industry norms and find better ways to solve shared problems.
  Members of the LF Energy community are dedicated to building a vibrant, sustainable
  ecosystem of digital assets that are critical for delivering affordable, reliable,
  safe and clean energy. Red Hat recently participated in a project within LF Energy
  to provide CentOS Stream 9 support to SEAPATH, an open source software hypervisor
  designed for IEC 61850 Digital Substation Automation Systems. SEAPATH is designed
  to run with Virtual Protection Automation and Control (vPAC) Alliance, creating
  a synergy among multiple open source grid projects and a very strong community among
  digital substation stakeholders. By committing our deep engineering resources and
  technical expertise to projects like SEAPATH, Red Hat will provide a proven, enterprise-ready
  open source platform that serves as the foundation for the next generation of energy
  infrastructure, accelerating the development of a more flexible, reliable, secure,
  and sustainable grid.
