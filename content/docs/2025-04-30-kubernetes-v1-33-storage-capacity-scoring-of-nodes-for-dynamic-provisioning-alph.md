tldr: Kubernetes v1.
summary: Kubernetes v1. 33 introduces a new alpha feature called StorageCapacityScoring.
  This feature adds a scoring method for pod scheduling with the topology-aware volume
  provisioning. This feature eases to schedule pods on nodes with either the most
  or least available storage capacity. This feature extends the kube-scheduler's VolumeBinding
  plugin to perform scoring using node storage capacity information obtained from
  Storage Capacity. Currently, you can only filter out nodes with insufficient storage
  capacity.
