  via Docker’s Sponsored Open Source Program SAN FRANCISCO, CA – September 18, 2025
  – The Cloud Native Computing Foundation ® (CNCF®), which builds sustainable ecosystems
  for cloud native software, today announced a new partnership with Docker, Inc. ®,
  a provider of cloud-native application and AI-native application development solutions
  and infrastructure, to expand secure, scalable support for CNCF-hosted projects.
  Through this collaboration all CNCF projects will gain direct access to Docker’s
  Sponsored Open Source (DSOS) program which helps open source communities grow and
  succeed by unlocking premium registry, security, and support services. “Docker was
  a founding member of CNCF, and we’ve maintained a long-term open collaboration over
  the past decade,” said Chris Aniszczyk, CTO, CNCF. “This partnership marks a step
  forward for CNCF projects and we’re glad to work together to further secure the
  open source supply chain. ” A Strategic Collaboration for the Ecosystem With DSOS
  access, CNCF projects will now benefit from: Unlimited image pulls from Docker Hub
  Sponsored OSS status for greater trust and visibility Access to Docker Scout for
  vulnerability analysis and policy enforcement Automated image builds from source
  Docker usage metrics and engagement insights Streamlined support through open source
  channels Docker Hub, the world’s largest registry for discovering, sharing, and
  storing container images, supports over 22 billion image downloads each month and
  hosts more than 14 million images. This partnership reflects CNCF’s commitment to
  supporting widely used infrastructure across the cloud native ecosystem, recognizing
  Docker’s role in both open source and enterprise workflows. For project maintainers,
  the partnership provides secure, scalable infrastructure tailored to the realities
  of running production-grade open source projects. For users, it ensures reliable
  and trustworthy access to the cloud native tools they depend on. “Docker’s mission
  has always been to empower developers, and we know that trust is earned through
  consistency, openness, and listening,” said Michael Donovan, VP of Products at Docker.
  “This partnership with CNCF reflects a broader commitment to the open source community
  by helping maintainers grow their projects, reach more developers through Docker
  Hub, and deliver value to their communities faster with improved tools, automation,
  and support. ” A Commitment to Secure Open Source Infrastructure This partnership
  also highlights a shared commitment to strengthening the open source software supply
  chain.'
