summary: We are excited to announce that Jenkins X will be participating in Hacktoberfest
  again this year! Hacktoberfest is a month-long global celebration of open source
  software. All backgrounds and skill levels are encouraged to participate in Hacktoberfest
  and join a global community of open source contributors. Learn more about Hacktoberfest
  and sign up here. We welcome your contributions to the Jenkins X project ! Issues
  labelled “hacktoberfest” generally indicate good first issues. However, all pull
  requests will count towards your Hacktoberfest challenge. Refer to the contribution
  guides for making code and documentation changes. Refer to this document to get
  an idea about the location of the different Jenkins X source code repositories.
  Normally the labels assigned to the ticket will help you in deciding which part
  of the Jenkins X codebase to look at. The maintainers will also try to link the
  relevant repository for hacktoberfest issues in the issue comment. Once you are
  done with the contribution, request a review from the maintainers by adding the
  comment in your pull request. We’re happy to help if you have any questions. Talk
  to us on our slack channels, which are part of the Kubernetes slack.
