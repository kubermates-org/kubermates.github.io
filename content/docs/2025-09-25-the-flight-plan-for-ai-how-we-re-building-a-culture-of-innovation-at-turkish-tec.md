  you think of Turkish Airlines, you might picture the vast network of flights that
  connects more countries than any other airline in the world. You might think of
  the more than 80 million passengers we serve annually, or the incredible logistical
  complexity of operating such a massive enterprise across 130 countries and 353 destinations.'

  At Turkish Technology, it''s our job to build the digital engine that powers it
  all. Our mission is to not only manage Turkish Airline systems today, but to build
  the next-generation digital products that will define the future of aviation. And
  for us, that future is undeniably driven by AI. My team and I didn''t approach AI
  as a collection of one-off pilot projects. Instead, we saw it as a strategic lever
  to accelerate our entire digital transformation. Our goal was to build a hardened,
  scalable, and replicable AI infrastructure that could be woven throughout the fabric
  of the organization. We embarked on this process nearly 3 years ago, and while we’ve
  made incredible progress, we know there''s no end to this journey–the airplanes
  always need to keep flying to their next stop. It''s an ongoing process and a continuous
  race to adapt as technology–especially generative AI (gen AI)–evolves at a rapid
  pace. One of our most important discoveries was that a technological transformation
  doesn''t begin with a software platform. It begins with your people.'
