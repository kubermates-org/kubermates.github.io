  VMware Cloud Foundation 5.2 to 9.0: Webinar Takeaways Operationalizing the Edge
  with VMware Cloud Foundation VMware Cloud Foundation is the Gold Standard for Virtual
  Desktop Infrastructure VMware Cloud Foundation (VCF) delivers unmatched benefits
  for virtual desktop infrastructure (VDI). Even after the spin-out of VMware’s End
  User Computing (EUC) business group into Omnissa , the fundamentals of this combined
  solution remain intact. However, the release of VCF 9.0 deserves revisiting those
  fundamentals to expose how the platform holds up. VCF 9.0 consolidates the private-cloud
  substrate (vSphere, vSAN, NSX) with cloud automation (VCF Automation), integrated
  Kubernetes (VMware vSphere Kubernetes Service / VKS) and other advanced services
  for VCF such as VMware Private AI Services and VMware Data Services Manager (DSM).
  These innovations, among many others, benefit the Omnissa Horizon VDI solution by
  providing an intrinsically secure, optimized and scalable foundation for the most
  demanding virtual desktops. Running Horizon on VCF 9.0 allows customers to benefit
  from the full set of services of a unified private cloud platform. VCF delivers
  workload domains, orchestrated upgrades, VPC-based network isolation, and a modern
  consumption API. It’s a platform that treats desktops as first-class workloads.
  Security is where VCF immediately shines. Use NSX firewall to wrap a least-privilege
  policy around Horizon Connection Servers, UAGs, and desktop pools without hair-pinning
  traffic into external firewalls. VCF 9.0’s VPC constructs enable stamping out a
  repeatable network perimeter for each Horizon function: Edge (UAG) Brokering (Connection
  Servers) Desktops Shared services These protections scale with the fleet instead
  of complicating it. VCF 9.0 also introduces a suite of integrated security and compliance
  features critical for VDI environments: Centralized network policy management with
  NSX bolster lateral traffic protection for sensitive VDI desktops, aligning with
  stringent compliance frameworks.'
