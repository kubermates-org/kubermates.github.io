  Virtualization Share Last year, Red Hat introduced Red Hat OpenStack Services on
  OpenShift , the next major release of Red Hat OpenStack Platform. The architectural
  shift brought the power of OpenStack’s Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) together
  with the agility of Red Hat OpenShift, allowing organizations to run virtualized
  and cloud-native workloads on a single, unified platform. As businesses face increasing
  pressure to optimize costs and consolidate IT environments, especially in light
  of shifting market dynamics, many are looking for a modern approach to managing
  their cloud infrastructure. To address that challenge, Red Hat is introducing Red
  Hat OpenStack VMware migration toolkit (based on the os-migrate VMware toolkit upstream
  project) to support the adoption of OpenStack Services on OpenShift. This new migration
  toolkit is designed to simplify and accelerate your journey to Red Hat OpenStack
  Services on OpenShift. It''s designed to address the real-world challenges of migrating
  mission critical workloads from VMware, giving you a streamlined and efficient path
  forward. With this toolkit, users can: Seamlessly move workloads : The tool provides
  a direct and automated pathway to migrate an existing virtual machine (VM) with
  minimal disruption. Leverage automation : Integrate the migration process into your
  existing Red Hat Ansible Automation Platform workflows. Scale migration efforts
  : This tool is designed to handle large-scale migrations, enabling you to move VMs
  efficiently over a short period. Unify management : The migration toolkit simplifies
  the experience of bringing your legacy virtualized workloads into a singular control
  plane, where they can coexist with your new cloud-native, containerized applications.
  Warm migration : A specialized Ansible collection aims to simplify and automate
  the migration process from VMWare environments into Red Hat OpenStack Services on
  OpenShift. The Red Hat OpenStack VMware migration toolkit is delivered as an Ansible
  collection.'
