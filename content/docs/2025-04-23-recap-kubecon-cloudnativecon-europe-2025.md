tldr: 'When I got the assignment to attend KubeCon 1st of April I thought it was an
  April prank, but as the date got closer I realized—this is for real and I’ll be
  on the ground in London at the tenth anniversary of cloud native computing. I’ve
  seen a lot of tech events during my years in the industry while trying not to get
  replaced by AI and I have to say this one stands out! Image source: CNCF YouTube

  Channel Here is my recap of KubeCon + CloudNativeCon Europe 2025. CalicoCon is an
  event that happens twice every year, as a co-located event during KubeCon NA and
  EU. It’s a free event that allows you to learn about Tigera’s vision for the future
  of networking and security in the cloud. There’s also an after-party to celebrate
  our community and people like you who are on this journey with us! This year our
  main focus was on Calico v3. 30 , our upcoming release that will add a lot of anticipated
  features to Calico, unlocking things like observability, staged network policy,
  and gateway api. CalicoCon brought together cloud-native enthusiasts to explore
  the latest advancements in Calico and Kubernetes networking. The following is a
  brief summary of this year’s CalicoCon sessions. Note: The CalicoCon playlist with
  session recordings is now available on YouTube. Peter Kelly, VP of Engineering at
  Tigera, highlighted the new features in Calico v3. 30. A key focus was on the new
  observability features, including the “Whisker” dashboard, designed to provide deeper
  insights into network behavior.'
