  the assignment to attend KubeCon 1st of April I thought it was an April prank, but
  as the date got closer I realized—this is for real and I’ll be on the ground in
  London at the tenth anniversary of cloud native computing. I’ve seen a lot of tech
  events during my years in the industry while trying not to get replaced by AI and
  I have to say this one stands out! Image source: CNCF YouTube Channel Here is my
  recap of KubeCon + CloudNativeCon Europe 2025. CalicoCon is an event that happens
  twice every year, as a co-located event during KubeCon NA and EU. It’s a free event
  that allows you to learn about Tigera’s vision for the future of networking and
  security in the cloud. There’s also an after-party to celebrate our community and
  people like you who are on this journey with us! This year our main focus was on
  Calico v3. 30 , our upcoming release that will add a lot of anticipated features
  to Calico, unlocking things like observability, staged network policy, and gateway
  api. CalicoCon brought together cloud-native enthusiasts to explore the latest advancements
  in Calico and Kubernetes networking. The following is a brief summary of this year’s
  CalicoCon sessions. Note: The CalicoCon playlist with session recordings is now
  available on YouTube. Peter Kelly, VP of Engineering at Tigera, highlighted the
  new features in Calico v3. 30.'
