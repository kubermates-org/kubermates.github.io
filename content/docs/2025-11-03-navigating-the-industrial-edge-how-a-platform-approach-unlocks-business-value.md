  Applications Virtualization Share When I talk to industrial customers, a consistent
  theme emerges: the world of operational technology (OT) is undergoing a rapid, often-daunting
  transformation. For decades, OT environments have been built on proprietary, siloed
  systems, prized for their stability and longevity. But as we see technology power
  improvements in efficiency, productivity, and cost reduction, the pressure to evolve
  is immense. It''s no longer just about keeping the factory running; it''s about
  making it smarter, more agile, and more resilient. This shift presents a unique
  challenge for IT managers and business leaders. How do you bring the benefits of
  modern IT—like automation, security, and data analytics—into a world built on a
  completely different set of principles, all without disrupting mission-critical
  operations? As a software company with deep IT roots, Red Hat knew that in order
  to truly have relevance in this space, we needed to not only bring in experts in
  the OT space, but also to partner with trusted brands like ABB, Schneider Electric,
  and more that could provide guidance on how to move into the OT space. Red Hat is
  focused on helping industries navigate this transformation by providing a more consistent
  advanced compute platform designed to simplify deployment, maintenance, and operations.
  Our open source solutions are designed to lower operating costs, accelerate time-to-market,
  and deliver reliable innovation with greater security capabilities. The answer isn''t
  about replacing everything overnight. It''s about building a bridge and this is
  where a comprehensive, platform-centric approach becomes so powerful. Breaking down
  silos is key. In my experience, the biggest roadblock isn''t the technology itself—it''s
  the historical and necessary distinction between IT and OT.'
