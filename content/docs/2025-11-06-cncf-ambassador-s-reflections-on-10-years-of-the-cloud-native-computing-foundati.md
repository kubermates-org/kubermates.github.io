  this post Ambassador post originally published on Medium by Dotan Horovits “Cloud
  Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) is a new open standardization initiative recently
  formed under the Linux Foundation with the mission of providing standard reference
  architecture for cloud native applications and services, based on open-source software
  (OSS). ” That’s how I started my blog post 10 years ago , in August 2015 (back then
  I blogged on WordPress). And the momentum carried on. Eight months later I was excited
  to share that Prometheus joined The CNCF. Prometheus has since become a de-facto
  standard for cloud-native monitoring, and recently reached an important milestone
  with the long-awaited 3.0 major release. More projects have followed suit and joined
  the CNCF to augment Kubernetes with needed capabilities for running critical production
  workloads and managing them at scale, addressing aspects such as observability,
  security and networking. This ecosystem has fortified Kubernetes as the de-facto
  standard for container orchestration (remember that 10 years ago we had also Docker
  swarm, Mesos, Nomad?). In fact, just last year we celebrated 10 years to Kubernetes
  (or as we called it in the CNCF: kuberTENes). Since then the CNCF has grown to over
  200 projects in various maturity stages, including over 30 graduated project. The
  domains have also expanded from Kubernetes and its immediate circle in the DevOps
  domain, into far wider topics, ranging from FinOps to Platform Engineering and chaos
  engineering. In fact, looking at the CNCF landscape these days could be somewhat
  overwhelming. I got to escort OpenTelemetry, second most active project in the CNCF,
  since its foundation.'
