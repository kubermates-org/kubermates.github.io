  Virtualization Share A seamless developer experience (DevEx) isn''t just a luxury,
  it''s a necessity. But the reality for many organizations is that developers are
  spending a significant amount of their valuable time on tasks other than coding.
  Research from a recent ShiftMag survey reveals that developers lose an average of
  8 hours each week to inefficiencies such as technical debt and insufficient documentation.
  These frustrations are not just a nuisance, they''re a drain on productivity that
  can lead to burnout and a substantial loss of potential output for the business.
  This is why platform engineering has emerged as a strategic imperative for businesses.
  According to Gartner , an estimated 80% of large software engineering organizations
  will establish platform engineering teams by 2026 to provide reusable services and
  tools for application delivery. The path to building a successful internal developer
  platform can be daunting. With so many tools and processes to consider, it can be
  difficult to know where to begin. This is precisely why Red Hat created the Developer
  Experience Assessment workshop. This two-week interactive workshop provides an increased
  understanding of the current developer experience, platform engineering teams, and
  DevOps principles through a classroom-style discovery workshop. This workshop is
  designed to help teams uncover hidden friction points between teams and map out
  the application onboarding and development lifecycle. The outcome is a tailored
  roadmap, or recipe, for how to improve your DevEx and scale platform adoption.'
