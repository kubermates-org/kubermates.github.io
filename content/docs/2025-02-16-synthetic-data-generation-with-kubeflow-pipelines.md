  On-premise Summary When creating insights, decisions, and actions from data, the
  best results come from real data. But accessing real data often requires lengthy
  security and legal processes. The data may also be incomplete, biased, or too small,
  and during early exploration, we may not even know if it’s worth pursuing. While
  real data is essential for proper evaluation, gaps or limited access frequently
  hinder progress until the formal process is complete. To address these challenges,
  synthetic data provides an alternative. It mimics real data’s statistical properties
  while preserving privacy and accessibility. Synthetic data generators (synthesizers)
  are models trained on real data to generate new datasets that follow the same statistical
  distributions and relationships but do not contain real records. This allows for
  accelerated development, improved data availability, and enhanced privacy. Depending
  on the technique used, synthetic data not only mirrors statistical base properties
  of real data but also preserves correlations between features. These synthesizers
  — such as those based on Gaussian Copulas, Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs),
  and Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) — enable the creation of high-fidelity synthetic
  datasets. See more description of these techniques below. While the above focuses
  on speed of development in general, and augmentation of data to improve performance
  of analytical modes, there are more motivations for creating (synthetic) data: Enhanced
  Privacy and Security Mimics real datasets without containing sensitive or personally
  identifiable information, mitigating privacy risks and ensuring compliance with
  regulations like GDPR.'
