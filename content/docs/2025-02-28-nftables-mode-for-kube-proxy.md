tldr: A new nftables mode for kube-proxy was introduced as an alpha feature in Kubernetes
  1.
summary: A new nftables mode for kube-proxy was introduced as an alpha feature in
  Kubernetes 1. 29. Currently in beta, it is expected to be GA as of 1. 33. The new
  mode fixes long-standing performance problems with the iptables mode and all users
  running on systems with reasonably-recent kernels are encouraged to try it out.
  (For compatibility reasons, even once nftables becomes GA, iptables will still be
  the default.
