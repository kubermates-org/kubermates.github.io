  YLD A common pattern in today’s AI adoption is that businesses are investing heavily
  in GenAI capabilities, yet many are leaving significant value on the table by failing
  to pair it with Agentic AI. This matters because while GenAI can generate content,
  ideas, or responses, it can’t act on them. However, when combined with Agentic AI,
  your systems shift from being reactive and prompt-driven to autonomous and outcome-oriented.
  This article aims to help senior technology leaders better understand the value
  Agentic AI can add to existing AI infrastructure, while outlining key considerations
  to determine whether its implementation aligns with your business needs. Image caption:
  Core components of an Agentic AI Architecture from Markovate. Agentic AI systems
  are designed to operate autonomously, perceiving their environment, making decisions,
  and executing actions without continuous human oversight. This autonomy enables
  businesses to streamline operations, reduce costs, and enhance scalability. The
  image above illustrates how the following systems function: Ultimately, Agentic
  AI systems are equipped with learning mechanisms that improve over time. Through
  techniques like reinforcement learning, where the system learns from the outcomes
  of its actions, and supervised or unsupervised learning, where it identifies patterns
  in data, the AI adapts to new situations and refines its decision-making processes.
  The most disruptive AI solutions over the next few years will combine GenAI with
  Agentic AI, and the key to achieving better business outcomes is knowing when to
  use one, the other, or both. Not every use case requires a full agentic system,
  but many businesses will be surprised at how many should. GenAI alone: GenAI excels
  at generating new content from existing data patterns, significantly boosting creativity
  and productivity across various domains.'
