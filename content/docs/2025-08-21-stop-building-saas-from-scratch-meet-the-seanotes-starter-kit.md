  \ 3 min read Thereâ\x80\x99s a moment in every SaaS project where you realizeâ\x80\
  ¦ Youâ\x80\x99re not building your product yet. Youâ\x80\x99re setting up auth.\
  \ Youâ\x80\x99re wiring up Stripe. Youâ\x80\x99re figuring out how to send emails,\
  \ where to store files, how to deploy it â\x80\x94 and now, how to sprinkle in just\
  \ enough AI to make it feel modern. Even in 2025, LLMs still struggle with this\
  \ part. Theyâ\x80\x99re great at scaffolding UI and generating business logic. But\
  \ they donâ\x80\x99t know how to spin up a database, integrate Stripe, or deploy\
  \ an actual app. Thatâ\x80\x99s exactly what SeaStack solves. SeaStack is a new\
  \ series of open-source starter kits and reference apps from DigitalOcean â\x80\x94\
  \ built to help developers ship real apps, faster. Itâ\x80\x99s our way of saying:\
  \ â\x80\x9C Hereâ\x80\x99s how you can build real things with DigitalOcean â\x80\
  \x94 and hereâ\x80\x99s the source code to get started. â\x80\x9D And SeaNotes is\
  \ the first one. Live Demo View the GitHub Repo SeaNotes SaaS Starter Kit is an\
  \ open source GitHub repo that gives developers a simple, production-ready foundation\
  \ to build real SaaS apps â\x80\x94 fast."
