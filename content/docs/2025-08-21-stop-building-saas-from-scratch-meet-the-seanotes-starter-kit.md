summary: "By Amit Jotwani and Haimantika Mitra Thereâ\x80\x99s a moment in every SaaS\
  \ project where you realizeâ\x80¦ Youâ\x80\x99re not building your product yet.\
  \ Youâ\x80\x99re setting up auth. Youâ\x80\x99re wiring up Stripe. Youâ\x80\x99\
  re figuring out how to send emails, where to store files, how to deploy it â\x80\
  \x94 and now, how to sprinkle in just enough AI to make it feel modern. Even in\
  \ 2025, LLMs still struggle with this part. Theyâ\x80\x99re great at scaffolding\
  \ UI and generating business logic. But they donâ\x80\x99t know how to spin up a\
  \ database, integrate Stripe, or deploy an actual app. Thatâ\x80\x99s exactly what\
  \ SeaStack solves. SeaStack is a new series of open-source starter kits and reference\
  \ apps from DigitalOcean â\x80\x94 built to help developers ship real apps, faster.\
  \ Itâ\x80\x99s our way of saying: â\x80\x9C Hereâ\x80\x99s how you can build real\
  \ things with DigitalOcean â\x80\x94 and hereâ\x80\x99s the source code to get started.\
  \ â\x80\x9D And SeaNotes is the first one. SeaNotes SaaS Starter Kit is an open\
  \ source GitHub repo that gives developers a simple, production-ready foundation\
  \ to build real SaaS apps â\x80\x94 fast."
