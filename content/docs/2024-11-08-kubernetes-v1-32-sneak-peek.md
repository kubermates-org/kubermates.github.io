summary: As we get closer to the release date for Kubernetes v1. 32, the project develops
  and matures. Features may be deprecated, removed, or replaced with better ones for
  the project's overall health. This blog outlines some of the planned changes for
  the Kubernetes v1. 32 release, that the release team feels you should be aware of,
  for the continued maintenance of your Kubernetes environment and keeping up to date
  with the latest changes. Information listed below is based on the current status
  of the v1. 32 release and may change before the actual release date. The Kubernetes
  project has a well-documented deprecation policy for features. This policy states
  that stable APIs may only be deprecated when a newer, stable version of that API
  is available and that APIs have a minimum lifetime for each stability level. A deprecated
  API has been marked for removal in a future Kubernetes release will continue to
  function until removal (at least one year from the deprecation). Its usage will
  result in a warning being displayed. Removed APIs are no longer available in the
  current version, so you must migrate to use the replacement instead.
