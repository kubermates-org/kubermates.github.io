  Share New year, new pressure As a PMM, I spend a lot of time at the intersection
  of technology and the way we communicate it. It is my job to understand what companies
  shaping the AI infrastructure space are bringing to market, and also to pay attention
  to the why and how behind the way they talk about it. Online, at conferences around
  the world, and in hallway conversations, I am watching not only what our industry
  is building but the framing that surrounds it. Across AI gatherings this year, both
  virtual and in person, a pattern has become impossible to miss: AI is being marketed
  through urgency and fear, not clarity. Many companies are speaking to decision-makers
  with a tone that feels more like pressure than guidance. The message is consistent:
  you are behind, everyone else is moving faster, adopt now or lose your chance. Once
  that becomes the backdrop, even the most capable teams start to feel overwhelmed.
  The pace and volume of this kind of marketing can make people want to move quickly
  just to quiet the anxiety. That pressure is not accidental. It is meant to make
  the moment feel like it is slipping away, even though the reality is that nobody,
  including the people doing the marketing, can predict exactly what comes next. AI
  often gets framed as something opaque or too complex to take on yourself, and that
  framing naturally pushes you toward relying on someone else’s version of it. The
  narrative becomes that you cannot replicate the work and that you do not need to
  understand how it functions, which makes the black box feel like the only safe option.'
