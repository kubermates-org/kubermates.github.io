  and the Bigger Picture Why Pods Matter How Kubernetes Works - Step-by-Step Workflow
  Step 1: Defining the Desired State Step 2: API Server Processes the Request Step
  3: Scheduler Assigns Pods to Nodes Step 4: Kubelet Creates and Monitors Pods Step
  5: Kube-Proxy Manages Networking Step 6: Controller Manager Ensures Desired State
