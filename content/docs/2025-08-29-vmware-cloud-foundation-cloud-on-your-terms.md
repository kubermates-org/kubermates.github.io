  At Broadcom, we are committed to empowering our customers to build and manage modern
  private clouds on their own terms. With VMware Cloud Foundation (VCF) 9.0, we’re
  giving our customers a consistent operating model that brings the agility and scalability
  of the public cloud together with the security, performance, and cost benefits of
  an on-premises environment. Our goal with this new version is to make our customers’
  lives easier by delivering a single, unified platform that supports all applications
  — from traditional to modern and AI-based — and gives them a consistent experience
  across their data centers, edge, and cloud infrastructure. The VCF customer entitlement
  of license portability is a game-changer, introduced by Broadcom to give customers
  the freedom to use it where it makes the most sense for their business. It allows
  them to move their licenses and workloads between on-premises data centers and supported
  endpoints, including hyperscale clouds. This isn’t just a feature; it’s a fundamental
  shift that puts customer in control of their private cloud deployment preference.
  To ensure our customers have consistent user experience, the fastest access to our
  latest innovations, and maximum flexibility to move VCF environments anywhere they
  choose, Broadcom is transforming its hyperscaler go to market to a license portability-only
  operating model beginning in the new fiscal year. Customers will purchase VCF subscriptions
  from Broadcom, which includes license portability to any supported hyperscale cloud.
  This change simplifies and streamlines how customers consume and deploy VCF along
  with global hyperscaler cloud infrastructure offerings. By combining the powerful
  innovations of VCF 9.0 with the flexibility of license portability, we’re giving
  customers the ability to deliver a modern private cloud that aligns with their business
  goals. Customers can innovate on their own timeline, leverage the infrastructure
  they already have, and expand to the cloud when needed. Ultimately, with VCF and
  license portability, Broadcom is delivering the modern private cloud on our customers’
  terms.
