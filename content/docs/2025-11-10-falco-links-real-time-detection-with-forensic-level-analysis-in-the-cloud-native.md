  ATLANTA—KUBECON + CLOUDNATIVECON NORTH AMERICA, Nov. 10, 2025 — The Cloud Native
  Computing Foundation® (CNCF®), which builds sustainable ecosystems for cloud native
  software, today announced new integrations between Falco , a graduated project,
  and Stratoshark , a forensic tool inspired by Wireshark. With this release, Falco
  alerts can now trigger precise forensic captures, allowing real-time threat detection
  to be paired with deeper event analysis. Security and platform teams have long faced
  challenges bringing together real-time threat detection and the detailed forensic
  visibility needed for effective incident response. Historically, security analysts
  and incident responders relied on separate tools to manually capture full system-call
  activity, producing large volumes of unfiltered data that often slowed down investigations
  and complicated incident resolution. Falco Captures provides on-demand event recording,
  enabling alerts when a security rule triggers. Each triggered alert comes with an
  automatically recorded trail of system calls, ready for immediate replay and inspection,
  equipping security analysts with precise, actionable insight. “We’ve long seen how
  alerts without context force a time‑costly hunt,” said Leonardo Grasso, core maintainer
  of Falco.
