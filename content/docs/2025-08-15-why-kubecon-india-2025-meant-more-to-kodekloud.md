tldr: That big queue at your booth? Brilliant. It’s exactly what KodeKloud is about.
summary: 'That big queue at your booth? Brilliant. It’s exactly what KodeKloud is
  about. When attendees, speakers, and industry peers tell you that at KubeCon India,
  it’s a clear sign that what KodeKloud is doing is making a real impact. For KodeKloud,
  KubeCon India 2025 was more than a tech conference. It was a celebration of community,
  connection, and the power of practical learning in the Cloud Native space. From
  conversations with global leaders to meeting hundreds of learners face-to-face,
  this year meant more than ever before. One of the proudest moments for us at KubeCon
  India 2025 was standing alongside the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) and
  the Linux Foundation Education team to announce a new initiative tailored specifically
  for learners in India. This partnership is designed to make Cloud Native certifications
  more accessible, affordable, and achievable in the region through: KodeKloud – Linux
  Foundation Partnership for Localized Certification Payment Click to learn more and
  explore our partnership → For us at KodeKloud, this is about much more than payments
  - it’s about removing barriers that keep talented engineers from reaching their
  potential. India is home to some of the most passionate DevOps and Cloud Native
  professionals in the world, and now, more of them will have a clear, affordable
  pathway to earning globally recognized certifications. The announcement was made
  live at KubeCon, with CNCF and Linux Foundation leaders sharing the stage - a powerful
  reminder that when communities and education providers work together, opportunities
  multiply. One of the standout moments was when Mumshad Mannambeth , KodeKloud’s
  founder, met Chris Aniszczyk , the CTO of the Cloud Native Computing Foundation
  (CNCF). Their conversation touched on: It was a meeting of minds that reflected
  exactly what KubeCon stands for - collaboration, knowledge-sharing, and driving
  the industry forward together.'
