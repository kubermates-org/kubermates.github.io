tldr: "By Nicole Ghalwash We are excited to announce that role-based access control\
  \ (RBAC) is now available for DigitalOcean Managed MongoDB, starting with predefined\
  \ roles! These new roles include the pre-defined roles of â\x80\x9C readOnly â\x80\

summary: "By Nicole Ghalwash We are excited to announce that role-based access control\
  \ (RBAC) is now available for DigitalOcean Managed MongoDB, starting with predefined\
  \ roles! These new roles include the pre-defined roles of â\x80\x9C readOnly â\x80\
  \x9D, â\x80\x9C readWrite â\x80\x9D and â\x80\x9C dbAdmin â\x80\x9D. Learn more\
  \ about it here. This update brings greater security, efficiency, and compliance\
  \ to your MongoDB clusters. With predefined roles, you can now easily manage access\
  \ control, reduce security risks, and streamline database administration across\
  \ your MongoDB clusters on DigitalOcean. Managing database access can be a challenge,\
  \ especially as teams grow and security requirements become more complex. Without\
  \ a structured approach, organizations risk unauthorized access, operational inefficiencies,\
  \ and compliance gaps. With RBAC now applicable to your MongoDB environment, you\
  \ can enforce clear, predefined access policiesâ\x80\x94helping to ensure secure,\
  \ efficient, and scalable database management. Hereâ\x80\x99s how RBAC can benefit\
  \ your business: Enhanced security: RBAC protects against unauthorized access by\
  \ only allowing verified users to interact with sensitive database resources. This\
  \ reduces the risk of data breaches and strengthens overall security posture. Operational\
  \ efficiency: With predefined roles, administrators can streamline user provisioning\
  \ and de-provisioning, minimizing the manual workload and reducing errors. Improved\
  \ compliance: RBAC helps organizations meet industry standards and regulatory requirements\
  \ by enforcing structured access controls, making audits and reporting more straightforward.\
  \ Cost savings: By automating user access management, RBAC reduces administrative\
  \ overhead and lowers the risk of security breaches, which can be costly to remediate."
