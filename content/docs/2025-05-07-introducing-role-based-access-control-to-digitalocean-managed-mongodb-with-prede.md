  \ to your MongoDB clusters. With predefined roles, you can now easily manage access\
  \ control, reduce security risks, and streamline database administration across\
  \ your MongoDB clusters on DigitalOcean. Managing database access can be a challenge,\
  \ especially as teams grow and security requirements become more complex. Without\
  \ a structured approach, organizations risk unauthorized access, operational inefficiencies,\
  \ and compliance gaps. With RBAC now applicable to your MongoDB environment, you\
  \ can enforce clear, predefined access policiesâ\x80\x94helping to ensure secure,\
  \ efficient, and scalable database management. Hereâ\x80\x99s how RBAC can benefit\
  \ your business: Enhanced security: RBAC protects against unauthorized access by\
  \ only allowing verified users to interact with sensitive database resources. This\
  \ reduces the risk of data breaches and strengthens overall security posture. Enhanced\
