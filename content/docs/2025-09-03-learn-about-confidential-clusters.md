  Virtualization Share The Confidential Clusters project integrates confidential computing
  technology into Kubernetes clusters. It's an end-to-end solution that provides data
  confidentiality on cloud platforms by isolating a cluster from its underlying infrastructure.
  In a confidential cluster, all nodes run on top of confidential virtual machines
  (cVM). Before a node can join the cluster and access secrets, the platform and environment's
  authenticity are verified through remote attestation. This process involves communication
  with a trusted remote server. Confidential Clusters enables you to use Red Hat OpenShift,
  a trusted platform to develop, modernize, and deploy applications at scale and leverage
  the convenience and flexibility of the cloud services without compromising on data
  security. This is critical for industries such as financial services, health care,
  and government that need to adhere to the regulatory requirements such as the European
  Digital Operational Resiliency Act (DORA). The general availability of OpenShift
  confidential nodes on cVM is now offered with AMD SEV-SNP and Intel TDX integration
  on Google Cloud Platform (GCP), as well as with AMD SEV-SNP on Azure in OpenShift
  version 4.19. Support for Intel TDX on Azure will be available in version 4.20 and
  above. Additionally, the integration of remote attestation is currently under development
  and will be included in future OpenShift releases. It’s a complex technology, but
  that doesn't mean it's complex to set up. Here are three articles to get you started.
