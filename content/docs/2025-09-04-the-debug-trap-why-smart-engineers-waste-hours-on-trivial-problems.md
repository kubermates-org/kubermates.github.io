  The Revert Rebellion The Exotic Bug Fallacy The Debug Stack The Meta Problem Posted
  on September 4, 2025 by Anshul Sao, Co-Founder & CTO at Facets. cloud Last month,
  I watched three senior engineers burn four hours debugging a “mysterious” Kubernetes
  issue that turned out to be a kubectl version upgrade. The same week, another team
  spent an entire night hunting phantom load balancer bugs when a certificate rotation
  had broken mobile clients with certificate pinning. These aren’t stories about incompetent
  engineers. These are stories about brilliant people falling into the same cognitive
  trap that catches everyone: diving deep instead of looking broad. Here’s what happened
  with the kubectl disaster. The symptoms looked serious: cron jobs failing, secrets
  not updating across namespaces, image pulls crashing left and right. Classic distributed
  systems chaos, right? The team immediately went into full forensic mode. Pod logs.
  RBAC permissions. Service account configurations. Network policies.'
