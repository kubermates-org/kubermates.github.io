  Merge-Forward CNCF projects highlighted in this post Stepping into my first KubeCon
  + CloudNativeCon, held this year in November in Atlanta, Georgia, felt like entering
  a world I had been following from afar for years; a world full of brilliant minds,
  bold ideas, and a shared dedication to building a more open and inclusive cloud-native
  ecosystem. What made this experience even more meaningful was navigating it as a
  neurodivergent person and discovering spaces where people like me not only belong
  but are celebrated. KubeCon + CloudNativeCon is often talked about as a conference
  but in reality, it’s a community gathering. Since Day 1 the OpenTelemetry Observatory
  was filled with conversations of contributors and maintainers to which I participated,
  and it felt like a safe space for me. One of the most unforgettable moments of the
  week was receiving the 2025 OpenTelemetry Community Award. This recognition wasn’t
  just about my personal contributions, it was a reflection of the support, encouragement
  and generosity of a community that thrives on collaboration. The award reminded
  me of why open source matters: because it’s built by people who care. A particularly
  powerful part of my KubeCon journey was engaging with the Merge Forward initiative.
  Merge Forward is a CNCF Technical Community Group made up of several subgroups,
  including Deaf & Hard of Hearing, Blind & Visually Impaired, Stuttering & Speech
  Diversity, Women in Cloud Native, Deep Roots, Friends of Dorothy and Neurodiversity.
  Its mission is to build supportive networks and safe spaces where underrepresented
  communities and their allies can come together to learn, mentor, grow, and simply
  be themselves. Merge Forward provides a safe place for people to share experiences,
  find community, and ask for help without judgment. But we cannot do this alone;
  we need allies.'
