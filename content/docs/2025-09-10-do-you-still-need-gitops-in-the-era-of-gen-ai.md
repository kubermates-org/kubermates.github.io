  Applications Virtualization Share If you''ve ever worked for or with enterprise
  companies you know that, when it comes to software, whether it''s AI-powered or
  not, the stakes could not be higher. And that is the reason they invest heavily
  in making their production environments as bulletproof as possible. They will architect
  for high availability and disaster recovery, enforce strict service level agreements
  (SLAs), and build redundancy into every possible layer. But if their architecture
  doesn’t also account for the potential for human error , is any of it worth the
  effort? Time and again, we’ve seen catastrophic outages traced back to a wrong mouse
  click, a badly written command, or a rushed deployment. Let’s review a few of them:
  Amazon S3 outage (Feb 2017): An engineer mistyped a command intended to remove a
  few servers, instead taking down critical S3 subsystems. The disruption affected
  GitHub, Slack, and other big players, lasting several hours and costing billions
  of dollars in damages. Facebook global outage (Oct 2021): Engineers withdrew critical
  Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) routes during a backbone configuration change, causing
  Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp to vanish from the internet for nearly six hours,
  a lesson on how a single manual change can break world-class redundancy. CrowdStrike
  Falcon update meltdown (July 2024): A single defective configuration file shipped
  in an automated security-agent update sent millions of Windows machines into a reboot
  loop, grounding airlines, banks, and hospitals worldwide. Again, a preventable human
  mistake , just at internet scale. As a personal example, I once worked with a customer
  whose datacenter cleaning staff unplugged a production rack server to plug in a
  vacuum cleaner. That predictable and preventable mistake caused six hours of serious
  downtime (and I’m only being vague because the incident is recognizable). The solution
  would not be to fire the cleaner, but to install lockable power outlets, so critical
  equipment cannot be disconnected without a key.'
