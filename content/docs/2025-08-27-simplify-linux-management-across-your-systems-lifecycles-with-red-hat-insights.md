tldr: Share As a system administrator, keeping a Linux fleet running efficiently and
  securely can feel like you’re constantly putting out fires. Just when you address
  one issue, another one pops up, often because of a lack of visibility across your
  environment and too many manual, repetitive tasks.
summary: Share As a system administrator, keeping a Linux fleet running efficiently
  and securely can feel like you’re constantly putting out fires. Just when you address
  one issue, another one pops up, often because of a lack of visibility across your
  environment and too many manual, repetitive tasks. But what if you could spend less
  time reacting to problems and more time on the work that drives your business forward?
  That's why we're committed to building and improving new capabilities in Red Hat
  Insights for Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) to help you stay ahead of the curve.
  Insights for RHEL helps you proactively manage your environment across the entire
  system lifecycle. With exciting new features – some you may have already heard about
  at Red Hat Summit this past May - you can make better decisions, access targeted
  information when you need it, and automate repetitive tasks to increase efficiency.
  Planning for new systems can be difficult when you don't have a clear, centralized
  view of the future. The new Insights planning for RHEL capability provides a centralized
  view of future roadmap details, package lifecycle information, and deprecations.
  This helps you proactively plan system builds, anticipate potential impacts of updates,
  and align your infrastructure with your long-term strategy. You can build new images
  with confidence, avoiding last-minute scrambling and unexpected issues. We're also
  making it easier to create more complete and functional images with package recommendations
  in image builder. This new feature provides proactive package recommendations based
  on user inputs and real-world usage patterns, helping you discover valuable components
  you might otherwise overlook. This is like having a second set of eyes on your work,
  helping to minimize post-deployment headaches.
