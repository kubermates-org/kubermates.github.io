summary: "By Grace Morgan DigitalOceanâ\x80\x99s GenAI Platform is now DigitalOcean\
  \ Gradient Platform. Learn more about the GA release and features. As AI agents\
  \ become increasingly embedded in business operations, user experiences, and regulated\
  \ workflows, the need for greater transparency, control, and performance visibility\
  \ is more important than ever. Thatâ\x80\x99s why weâ\x80\x99re introducing a set\
  \ of major updates to GenAI Platform, now in public preview, including enhanced\
  \ agent development features and improved data sourcing through knowledge base citations.\
  \ These new capabilities make it easier than ever to build, deploy, and refine your\
  \ AI agents. Weâ\x80\x99re rolling out powerful new features that give teams more\
  \ control, transparency, and efficiency when working with AI agents. Knowledge base\
  \ citations for better transparency Understanding the source of AI-generated responses\
  \ is critical for trust and reliability. With the new knowledge base citations feature\
  \ , AI agents can now provide clear source attribution for retrieved information,\
  \ helping users trace responses back to their original context. This feature is\
  \ especially valuable for business intelligence applications and educational platforms,\
  \ where accurate and verifiable information is paramount. Agent insights for performance\
  \ monitoring Optimizing an AI agent requires clear visibility into how it processes\
  \ requests and responds to users. Agent insights provide key performance metrics\
  \ to help you refine your agents for speed, efficiency, and cost-effectiveness.\
  \ Agent insights give you the power to proactively monitor and refine your AI agents,\
  \ leading to a better end-user experience."
