  \x99s GenAI Platform is now DigitalOcean Gradient Platform. Learn more about the\
  \ GA release and features. As AI agents become increasingly embedded in business\
  \ operations, user experiences, and regulated workflows, the need for greater transparency,\
  \ control, and performance visibility is more important than ever. Thatâ\x80\x99\
  s why weâ\x80\x99re introducing a set of major updates to GenAI Platform, now in\
  \ public preview, including enhanced agent development features and improved data\
  \ sourcing through knowledge base citations. These new capabilities make it easier\
  \ than ever to build, deploy, and refine your AI agents. Weâ\x80\x99re rolling out\
  \ powerful new features that give teams more control, transparency, and efficiency\
  \ when working with AI agents. Knowledge base citations for better transparency\
  \ Understanding the source of AI-generated responses is critical for trust and reliability.\
  \ With the new knowledge base citations feature , AI agents can now provide clear\
  \ source attribution for retrieved information, helping users trace responses back\
  \ to their original context. Source attribution displays file names, URLs, PDF pages,\
  \ and table references. Improved auditability enables verification for compliance\
  \ and transparency. Enhanced trust reinforces confidence in AI-generated responses.\
  \ This feature is especially valuable for business intelligence applications and\
  \ educational platforms, where accurate and verifiable information is paramount."
