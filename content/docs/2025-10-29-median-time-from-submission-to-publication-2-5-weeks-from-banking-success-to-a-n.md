  Infrastructure Applications Virtualization Share Not every journey into technology
  is linear. Just ask Bradley, a non-traditional student at the University of North
  Carolina at Chapel Hill and a business analyst intern on the IT Operations Analytics
  team. Bradley started his career at Red Hat during the summer of 2024, but getting
  here has been an adventure in itself. We sat down with him to talk about unique
  career paths, transferable skills, and his experience with Red Hat’s emerging talent
  program. After graduating high school, Bradley pursued a career in banking instead
  of following the traditional college route. Over the next 5 years, he worked his
  way up from a banking associate to a senior role. Bradley was progressing well in
  his career, but felt like something was missing. “Everything was going pretty well
  for me,” says Bradley, “to the point that I had the freedom to make a different
  decision in life, to go do what I always wanted to do. And that was to work in technology
  in some way or another. ” Bradley began this transition by attending community college
  at night. “Weirdly enough, the astronomy course I took in community college was
  the reason I wanted to pursue a higher-level education at UNC,” he reflects. His
  astronomy professor was passionate about the subject and connected it to students’
  daily lives.'
