  back to the second episode of the ‚ÄúMeet Our Contributors‚Äù blog post series for APAC.
  This post will feature four outstanding contributors from the Australia and New
  Zealand regions, who have played diverse leadership and community roles in the Upstream
  Kubernetes project. So, without further ado, let‚Äôs get straight to the article.
  Caleb Woodbine is currently a member of the ii. nz organisation. He began contributing
  to the Kubernetes project in 2018 as a member of the Kubernetes Conformance working
  group. His experience was positive, and he benefited from early guidance from Hippie
  Hacker , a fellow contributor from New Zealand. He has made major contributions
  to Kubernetes project since then through SIG k8s-infra and k8s-conformance working
  group. Caleb is also a co-organizer of the CloudNative NZ community events, which
  aim to expand the reach of Kubernetes project throughout New Zealand in order to
  encourage technical education and improved employment opportunities. There need
  to be more outreach in APAC and the educators and universities must pick up Kubernetes,
  as they are very slow and about 8+ years out of date. NZ tends to rather pay overseas
  than educate locals on the latest cloud tech Locally. Dylan Graham is a cloud engineer
  from Adeliade, Australia.'
