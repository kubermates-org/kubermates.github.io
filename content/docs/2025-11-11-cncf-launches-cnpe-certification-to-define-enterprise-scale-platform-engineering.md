  certification portfolio as it meets growth training demand Key Highlights The Certified
  Cloud Native Platform Engineer (CNPE) joins CNCF’s certification portfolio and Certified
  Kubernetes Network Engineer (CKNE) is announced as the next upcoming certification
  in CNCF’s portfolio. In 2026, CNCF will release a new certification Certified Kubernetes
  Network Engineer (CKNE), an intermediate-level exam for networking of Kubernetes
  and cloud native platforms. Since its 2024 launch, CNCF’s Kubestronaut program has
  recognized more than 2,500 participants across 100+ countries, underscoring worldwide
  demand for cloud native expertise. KUBECON + CLOUDNATIVECON NORTH AMERICA, ATLANTA,
  Georgia – November 11, 2025 – The Cloud Native Computing Foundation ® (CNCF®), which
  builds sustainable ecosystems for cloud native software, today announced the global
  availability of the Certified Cloud Native Platform Engineer (CNPE) certification—a
  new credential designed to validate advanced, real-world expertise in architecting
  and operating enterprise-scale internal developer platforms (IDPs), as the community
  convenes in Atlanta for KubeCon + CloudNativeCon North America 2025 As organizations
  worldwide invest in platform engineering to scale developer velocity and reliability,
  the CNPE offers a clear pathway for professionals advancing from foundational knowledge
  to strategic leadership roles. Developed in collaboration with Linux Foundation
  Training & Certification , CNPE certifies proficiency in platform architecture,
  GitOps, observability, security, and developer experience across production-grade
  cloud native systems. “Platform engineering teams are quickly becoming the backbone
  of organizations looking to scale modern infrastructure, and with CNPE, we’re defining
  what excellence looks like at the open source and enterprise level by providing
  a career advantage to individuals,” said Chris Aniszczyk, CTO, CNCF. “This launch
  sets a global standard for the skills needed to design and operate secure and scalable
  platforms that empower teams and accelerate innovation. ” The CNPE is a performance-based,
  120-minute certification exam that builds on the Certified Cloud Native Platform
  Associate (CNPA). It covers five key domains: Platform Architecture and Infrastructure
  (15%), GitOps and Continuous Delivery (25%), Platform APIs and Self-Service Capabilities
  (25%), Observability and Operations (20%), and Security and Policy Enforcement (15%).
  Additionally, CNCF will have another new certification coming soon called Certified
  Kubernetes Network Engineer (CKNE). The CKNE certification will be a practical based,
  intermediate-level exam for networking of Kubernetes and cloud native platforms.
  The certification exam will be created by members of the cloud native community
  to reflect best practices without any vendor lock-in.'
