summary: By Debabrata Panigrahi It’s that time of the year again, Yayy!! Like last
  year, this year also we are back with Kubernetes Contributor Celebration, the annual
  end of the year celebration, to recognize our achievements and have some fun! It’s
  a time for us to relax, chat and do something fun with your fellow contributors!
  To register, please fill out the Registration Form. More details on how to join
  the event. DevOps Party Games “DevOps Party Games takes the idea of “online party
  games” and tilts it on its head by adding DevOps-inspired content to existing games,
  and then streams it live via Twitch for a worldwide audience to watch, comment,
  and hopefully be entertained. In addition, the hosts (Matt Stratton, Jeremy Meiss,
  and Dan Maher) will provide color commentary, much like a modern day Cotton McKnight
  and Pepper Brooks (announcers from Dodgeball). ” There will be a Kubernetes slant
  for this edition of DevOps Party Games. The Great Cloud Native Bakeoff A virtual
  cooking event styled after the Great British Bake-off will be held during the Kubernetes
  Celebration Event. Contestants will have 90 minutes to bake something related to
  to your Cloud Native experience. Anything goes, as long as the majority of preparation
  is done live. The competition is open to all skill levels, from baking from a cake
  mix to grinding your own flour as long as it’s somehow Kubernetes-themed. At the
  end of the contest, each baked good will be judged on ambition, execution, success,
  and implementation of a Kubernetes theme. The winner will get a unique, handmade,
  baking-related prize. We’re looking for cooks of all backgrounds and talents.
