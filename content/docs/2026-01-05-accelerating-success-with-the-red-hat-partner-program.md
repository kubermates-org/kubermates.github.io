  Program continues to evolve with enhancements centered on the entire partner lifecycle
  and designed to deliver three core outcomes for partners: simplicity, predictability,
  and profitability. Today, we are excited to introduce the latest updates to the
  Red Hat Partner Program. With these enhancements, Red Hat is providing a structure
  that prioritizes co-investment to drive profitability across core business areas
  for partners. By actively investing in partner programs, incentives and digital
  tooling, we can more seamlessly enable accelerated growth, reduce friction and expand
  market reach for our collective success. Let’s take a closer look at the newest
  improvements to the Red Hat partner experience and how these changes are designed
  to drive partner profitability: Red Hat’s incentives strategy is shifting away from
  simple reimbursement towards predictable rewards that better compensate partners
  who invest in Red Hat technologies and solutions. New incentives will reward partners
  for valuable activities throughout the entire customer lifecycle, including critical
  pre-sales activities like workshops and assessments. This new offering, separate
  from traditional Market Development Funds (MDF), is designed to reduce the necessity
  for partners to make upfront investments in order to participate in incentive benefits.
  A major enhancement driving incentives is the expansion of rebates and deal registration
  to cover additional indirect routes to market, including OEM and cloud opportunities.
  This significantly broadens partner eligibility for incentives and will help increase
  profitability for a wider range of partners. Additionally, partners will benefit
  from improved deal protection so they can feel more confident in their engagements
  with Red Hat. Lastly, to help ensure that partner incentives reflect Red Hat’s most
  critical emerging markets, bookings activities are expanding to explicitly include
  application services and AI, in addition to product segments like RHEL, OpenShift,
  and Ansible Automation Platform. This move rewards partners for selling success
  in key strategic growth areas in addition to existing product categories.'
