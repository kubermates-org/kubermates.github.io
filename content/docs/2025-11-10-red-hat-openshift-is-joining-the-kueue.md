  Security Edge computing Infrastructure Applications Virtualization Share Kueue is
  a community-driven project with the goal to develop a resource management system
  for Kubernetes that efficiently manages batch workloads. It enables sharing a Kubernetes
  cluster among teams and users in a fair, cost-effective, and efficient way. This
  blog post delves into what Kueue is, what its main use cases are, and introduces
  the Red Hat build of Kueue, a new operator from the Red Hat OpenShift team. Kueue
  operates by acting as a central controller that queues jobs and decides when and
  where they should run. It is designed to manage batch jobs effectively by providing
  advanced queuing, quota management, and resource sharing capabilities. Kueue helps
  in optimizing cluster utilization and ensuring that resources are allocated in a
  fair and efficient manner. Kueue is particularly useful in the AI space but there
  are other use cases. You can''t examine Kueue use cases without considering AI.
  While AI seems to insert itself into every topic and conversation, Kueue really
  has a highly relevant part to play. Kueue is key in managing and optimizing AI workloads
  within Kubernetes environments. To put it another way, if you are doing AI related
  work then you should be using Kueue. Here are some of the main AI use cases: Job
  scheduling and prioritization: Kueue allows for the efficient scheduling and prioritization
  of AI training and inference jobs.'
