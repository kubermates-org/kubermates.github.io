  Infrastructure Applications Virtualization Share As IT leaders and business executives,
  we''re looking beyond the current year to make strategic plans and prepare our organizations
  for what''s next. While AI is, without a doubt, the focus for everyone going into
  2026, it''s equally important to ensure the underlying technology platforms support
  your AI adoption strategy and your investment decisions for the future. The choices
  we make now regarding our technology platforms will directly impact our agility,
  efficiency, and ability to innovate in the years to come. We''re thrilled to see
  a recent IDC analyst study not only validate but also offer a comprehensive look
  into the value of an integrated platform approach, providing a great starting point
  for any organization''s future-facing strategy. The IDC paper, The Business Value
  of Red Hat Hybrid Cloud Solutions , validates that a unified hybrid cloud platform—consisting
  of a scalable operating system (OS), cloud application development platform, and
  enterprise-grade automation platform—delivers significant, measurable results and
  prepares your organization to support your AI adoption strategy. These findings
  come directly from in-depth interviews with Red Hat customers that have standardized
  much of their IT operations on our hybrid cloud solutions. Customers achieved: 74%
  faster business change execution. 38% higher development team productivity, translating
  to a $54.45 million average annual gain per organization. 60% faster new application
  development lifecycle. These metrics underscore the importance of choosing a foundational
  platform that eliminates organizational and technological barriers and boosts efficiency.
  As one customer noted: “ Instead of managing four vendors for different parts of
  the stack, we work with one. ” Another emphasized that Red Hat solutions should
  be a critical consideration for any innovative, AI-ready strategy.'
