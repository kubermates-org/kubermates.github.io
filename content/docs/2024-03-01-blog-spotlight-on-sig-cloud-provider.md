tldr: One of the most popular ways developers use Kubernetes-related services is via
  cloud providers, but have you ever wondered how cloud providers can do that? How
  does this whole process of integration of Kubernetes to various cloud providers
  happen? To answer that, let’s put the spotlight on SIG Cloud Provider. SIG Cloud

summary: 'One of the most popular ways developers use Kubernetes-related services
  is via cloud providers, but have you ever wondered how cloud providers can do that?
  How does this whole process of integration of Kubernetes to various cloud providers
  happen? To answer that, let’s put the spotlight on SIG Cloud Provider. SIG Cloud
  Provider works to create seamless integrations between Kubernetes and various cloud
  providers. Their mission? Keeping the Kubernetes ecosystem fair and open for all.
  By setting clear standards and requirements, they ensure every cloud provider plays
  nicely with Kubernetes. It is their responsibility to configure cluster components
  to enable cloud provider integrations. In this blog of the SIG Spotlight series,
  Arujjwal Negi interviews Michael McCune (Red Hat), also known as elmiko , co-chair
  of SIG Cloud Provider, to give us an insight into the workings of this group. Arujjwal
  : Let’s start by getting to know you. Can you give us a small intro about yourself
  and how you got into Kubernetes? Michael : Hi, I’m Michael McCune, most people around
  the community call me by my handle, elmiko. I’ve been a software developer for a
  long time now (Windows 3. 1 was popular when I started!), and I’ve been involved
  with open-source software for most of my career. I first got involved with Kubernetes
  as a developer of machine learning and data science applications; the team I was
  on at the time was creating tutorials and examples to demonstrate the use of technologies
  like Apache Spark on Kubernetes. That said, I’ve been interested in distributed
  systems for many years and when an opportunity arose to join a team working directly
  on Kubernetes, I jumped at it! Arujjwal : Can you give us an insight into what SIG
  Cloud Provider does and how it functions? Michael : SIG Cloud Provider was formed
  to help ensure that Kubernetes provides a neutral integration point for all infrastructure
  providers.'
