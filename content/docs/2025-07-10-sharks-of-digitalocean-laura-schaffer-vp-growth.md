summary: "By Sujatha R Technical Writer Laura Schaffer, Vice President of Growth at\
  \ DigitalOcean, leads the team responsible for helping customers onboard and grow\
  \ with DigitalOcean. In this edition of Shark Tales, she shares what excites her\
  \ about building a self-serve experience, the energy that fuels her team, and why\
  \ DigitalOcean stands out as a special place to work. Thereâ\x80\x99s a ton of opportunity\
  \ here, and Iâ\x80\x99m excited about everything weâ\x80\x99re building together.\
  \ But what really sets DigitalOcean apart is how driven and united we are. We show\
  \ up each day ready to collaborate, eager to deliver value to our customers, and\
  \ motivated to make things happen. Itâ\x80\x99s incredibly energizing to work in\
  \ an environment where everyone shares that same hunger. You feel it in every conversation\
  \ and project; itâ\x80\x99s inspiring, itâ\x80\x99s motivating, and it makes this\
  \ a truly special place to be. ð\x9F\x8E¥ Have a look at Laura Schafferâ\x80\x99\
  s full conversation â¬\x87ï¸\x8F I lead the Growth team, and our focus is on helping\
  \ customers get started with DigitalOcean. Itâ\x80\x99s such a fun space to be in\
  \ because we get to witness that first spark, when someone signs up, explores what\
  \ we offer, and has that â\x80\x9CAha!â\x80\x9D moment. Our platform is simple and\
  \ easy to use, and seeing new users discover that for themselves is incredibly rewarding.\
  \ Every day, my team helps users reach that point of discovery, and thatâ\x80\x99\
  s a powerful thing to be a part of. As someone focused on growth and self-serve,\
  \ Iâ\x80\x99m especially excited about how our technology enables simplicity."
