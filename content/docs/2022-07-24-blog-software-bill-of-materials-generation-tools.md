tldr: Software Bill Of Materials generation tools Prerequisite Different SBOM generation
  tools comparison 1 - Anchore Syft 2- Opensbom’s Spdx-Sbom-Generator 3- Kubernetes
  BOM 4- Microsoft SBOM tool 5- Tern Before you read this, you have to understand
  what are SBOMs and what are different formats of SBOMs If you got this far, you
  already realize the importance of SBOM generation, and also it should meet certain
  requirements to achieve its purpose. Due to various requirements depending on what
  standard you’re following, there has to be a way to automatically generate different
  output formats for different standards.
summary: 'Software Bill Of Materials generation tools Prerequisite Different SBOM
  generation tools comparison 1 - Anchore Syft 2- Opensbom’s Spdx-Sbom-Generator 3-
  Kubernetes BOM 4- Microsoft SBOM tool 5- Tern Before you read this, you have to
  understand what are SBOMs and what are different formats of SBOMs If you got this
  far, you already realize the importance of SBOM generation, and also it should meet
  certain requirements to achieve its purpose. Due to various requirements depending
  on what standard you’re following, there has to be a way to automatically generate
  different output formats for different standards. Also, it has to be suited for
  ci/cd solutions to keep up with the increasing number of releases for each organization.
  Note: Here we’re only considering open source tools Introduction: Anchore is a platform
  that implements sbom-powered supply chain security solutions for developers and
  enterprises. For generating SBOMs, a CLI tool and library named Syft was developed
  by Anchore that could be injected into your ci/cd pipeline to generate SBOMs from
  container images and filesystems at each step. Integration and Support: Syft is
  supported on Linux, Mac, and Windows and it can run as a docker container which
  makes it a great suit for CI systems. Other than the 3 SBOM standards, Syft can
  generate its JSON standard format to be input for other Anchore tools like Grype
  which is a vulnerability scanner for container images and filesystems. It supports
  projects based on the following package managers: Alpine (apk) C (conan) C++ (conan)
  Dart (pubs) Debian (dpkg) Dotnet (deps. json) Objective-C (cocoapods) Go (go. mod,
  Go binaries) Haskell (cabal, stack) Java (jar, ear, war, par, sar) JavaScript (npm,
  yarn) Jenkins Plugins (jpi, hpi) PHP (composer) Python (wheel, egg, poetry, requirements.
  txt) Red Hat (rpm) Ruby (gem) Rust (cargo. lock) Swift (cocoapods) Features and
  Specs: Easy to use Syft can generate a simple basic sbom by just running syft <image>
  this will only include the softwares included in the image’s final layer.'
