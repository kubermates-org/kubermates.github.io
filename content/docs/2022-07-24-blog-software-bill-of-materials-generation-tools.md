tldr: Before you read this, you have to understand what are SBOMs and what are different
  formats of SBOMs If you got this far, you already realize the importance of SBOM
  generation, and also it should meet certain requirements to achieve its purpose.
  Due to various requirements depending on what standard you’re following, there has
  to be a way to automatically generate different output formats for different standards.
summary: 'Before you read this, you have to understand what are SBOMs and what are
  different formats of SBOMs If you got this far, you already realize the importance
  of SBOM generation, and also it should meet certain requirements to achieve its
  purpose. Due to various requirements depending on what standard you’re following,
  there has to be a way to automatically generate different output formats for different
  standards. Also, it has to be suited for ci/cd solutions to keep up with the increasing
  number of releases for each organization. Note: Here we’re only considering open
  source tools Introduction: Anchore is a platform that implements sbom-powered supply
  chain security solutions for developers and enterprises. For generating SBOMs, a
  CLI tool and library named Syft was developed by Anchore that could be injected
  into your ci/cd pipeline to generate SBOMs from container images and filesystems
  at each step. Integration and Support: Syft is supported on Linux, Mac, and Windows
  and it can run as a docker container which makes it a great suit for CI systems.
  Other than the 3 SBOM standards, Syft can generate its JSON standard format to be
  input for other Anchore tools like Grype which is a vulnerability scanner for container
  images and filesystems. It supports projects based on the following package managers:
  Features and Specs: For more resources about Syft capabilities refer to the source
  repo and official documentation Introduction: Opensbom-Generator is an open source
  project initiated by the Linux Foundation SPDX workgroup to generate SBOMs using
  CLI tools. Currently, they support the standard spdx 2. 2 formats and JSON with
  their spdx-sbom-generator tool based on golang. It can only be used to generate
  SBOMs from a repository containing package files (no container images or archives
  support yet). They aim to provide SBOM generation support in ci/cd solutions.'
