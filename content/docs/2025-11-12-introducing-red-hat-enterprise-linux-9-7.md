  we build a new major version of Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) , our engineering
  teams learn a lot about what modern IT demands and what customers need to thrive.
  Those lessons shape the new capabilities and features we tout on the Red Hat Summit
  stage at launch. After the celebration of a launch, of course, comes the work of
  bringing those new capabilities to more RHEL customers by building them into previous
  editions. Today, with the launch of Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9.7, some of the most
  important security features of RHEL 10 are available to more people who need them.
  RHEL 10 is the first major Linux distribution fully equipped for post-quantum cryptography
  (PQC), and now we're introducing PQC algorithms to RHEL 9.7. These algorithms enable
  secure key exchange, which is crucial for countering future threats from quantum
  computers. Key exchange enhances data integrity, and building it into RHEL 9.7 prepares
  your security infrastructure for emerging threats. This is just the start for RHEL
  and PQC. We plan to continue adding algorithms to future releases, so you can keep
  up with evolving security practices and compliance mandates. That's not the only
  improvement coming with RHEL 9.7. It's full of new features and capabilities to
  help you innovate quickly, improve continuously, and operate Linux more simply.
  The RHEL command-line assistant has become an essential tool for customers who have
  struggled to fill the skills gap among their RHEL users.
