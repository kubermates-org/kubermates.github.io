  If you’re considering a change, Red Hat OpenShift offers an enterprise-grade application
  platform that can support your Kubernetes container strategy today and scale for
  the future. Red Hat OpenShift is a complete, enterprise-focused container application
  platform built on a hardened, consistent Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) foundation.
  Red Hat OpenShift offers the following benefits for your organization: Integrated
  security - Red Hat OpenShift provides built-in, proactive security features, including
  Security Context Constraints (SCCs) that are more restrictive than standard Kubernetes
  role-based access control (RBAC), and a foundation built on Red Hat Enterprise Linux
  CoreOS for immutable, managed-host operating systems (OSs). Consistent platform
  - Red Hat OpenShift delivers a consistent experience across on-premise, public cloud,
  and edge deployments. This consistency simplifies operations, troubleshooting, and
  compliance. Cluster security - Integrating Red Hat OpenShift compliance operator
  and applying enterprise security policies achieves a hardened security cluster.
  Integrated developer tools - Red Hat OpenShift features an integrated web console,
  built-in CI/CD tools, and ArgoCD for GitOps-based continuous deployment and developer
  tools. Red Hat OpenShift Pipelines and Source-to-Image (S2I) workflows boost developer
  productivity. The operator framework - Red Hat OpenShift takes advantage of operators
  (software extensions that manage the lifecycle of an application)—from deployment
  to upgrades, backups, and scaling—making Day 2 operations simple and reliable. Integration
  with existing DevOps toolchains, including GitHub, GitLab, and Jira.'
