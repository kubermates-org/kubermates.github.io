  Operational Efficiency with VMware Cloud Foundation Broadcom (VMware) Named a Leader
  in the 2025 GartnerⓇ Magic QuadrantTM for Distributed Hybrid Infrastructure for
  the 3rd Consecutive Year FinOps in VMware Cloud Foundation VMware vSphere Foundation
  (VVF) offers a solid platform for compute and storage virtualization. But as environments
  expand, complexity increases, and IT teams find themselves spending more time on
  routine upkeep than innovation. VMware Cloud Foundation (VCF) builds on VVF by introducing
  automation and integrated management that help reduce manual work, minimize downtime,
  and strengthen compliance. In our previous blog, we discussed the “5 Reasons to
  Upgrade from VMware vSphere Foundation to VMware Cloud Foundation. ” In this blog,
  we will focus on how VCF addresses common operational challenges. This video provides
  a great visual summary of how VMware Cloud Foundation addresses common operational
  challenges to improve efficiency. The challenge: Routine patching and upgrades consume
  hours each quarter. Manual, host-by-host updates don’t scale, introducing errors,
  and can create version mismatches that delay critical projects and increase security
  risk. The VCF approach: Automated lifecycle management applies upgrades and patches
  across compute, storage, and networking from a single pane. A 2025 VMware Cloud
  Foundation TCO study found that this automation reduces operational overhead by
  up to 60%. For GCI Communications, Alaska’s largest telecom provider, VCF cut infrastructure
  deployment times from months to days, giving IT resources valuable time back for
  strategic work. (Watch the video.'
