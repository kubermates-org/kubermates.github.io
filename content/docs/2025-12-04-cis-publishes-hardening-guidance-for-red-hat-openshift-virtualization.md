  Security ® (CIS ® ) has officially published guidance for hardening Red Hat OpenShift
  Virtualization. The official publication of the new CIS Benchmark ® for Red Hat
  OpenShift Virtualization is an important development for organizations running traditional
  virtual machines (VMs) alongside modern containers. OpenShift Virtualization is
  a feature of Red Hat OpenShift that allows existing VM-based workloads to run directly
  on the platform. This globally recognized, consensus-driven benchmark provides recommendations
  for creating a security-focused configuration for those environments. CIS is a community-driven
  nonprofit organization, which aims to "make the connected world a safer place" for
  businesses, governments, and people by developing and promoting best practice solutions.
  The CIS Benchmarks are one of those core solutions. They are a set of globally recognized
  best practices to help secure configuring operating systems (OSs), servers, and
  other technology. Developed and maintained by a global community of IT professionals,
  the CIS Benchmarks provide prescriptive instructions for creating a security-focused
  configuration baseline. The new CIS Benchmark for OpenShift Virtualization was developed
  based on the OpenShift Virtualization Hardening Guide. The CIS Benchmark provides
  detailed recommendations to strengthen your security posture by focusing on 4 key
  areas of optimization, including: Harden the platform from the ground up : This
  includes guidance on restricting GPU and USB pass-through to approved devices and
  disabling non-essential feature gates. Control workloads at every layer : The CIS
  Benchmark provides fine-grained controls, such as restricting exec and virtual network
  computing (VNC) access to approved administrators and disabling features like guest-memory
  overcommit. Segment and protect network traffic : This area focuses on using networking
  controls like Virtual Local Area Networks (VLANs) to isolate tenant or application
  traffic and applying Media Access Control (MAC) spoof filtering.'
