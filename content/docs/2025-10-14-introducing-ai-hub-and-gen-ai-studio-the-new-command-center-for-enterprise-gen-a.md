  How do you choose the right model? How do you empower your teams to experiment and
  build with the latest innovations in AI without creating organizational barriers?
  At Red Hat, we believe the future of AI is open, accessible, and manageable at scale.
  That''s why we’re excited to announce 2 new consolidated dashboard experiences in
  Red Hat OpenShift AI 3.0: the AI Hub and the Gen AI studio. These experiences are
  designed to streamline the entire gen AI lifecycle for enterprises by providing
  tailored components for the key personas innovating with AI within organizations:
  platform engineers and AI engineers. AI hub and gen AI studio work together to create
  a cohesive, end-to-end workflow for building production-ready AI solutions on a
  trusted, consistent platform. The AI hub is the central point for the management
  and governance of gen AI assets within OpenShift AI. It empowers platform engineers
  to discover, deploy, and manage the foundational components their teams need. Key
  components include: Catalog: A curated library where platform engineers can discover,
  compare, and evaluate a wide variety of models. This helps overcome "model selection
  paralysis" by providing the data needed to choose the optimal model for any use
  case. Registry: A central repository to register, version, and manage the lifecycle
  of AI models before they are configured for deployment. Deployments: An administrative
  page to configure, deploy, and monitor the status of models running on the cluster.'
