  OpenTofu is the open source continuation of Hashicorp® Terraform™. The very first
  of these events was in 2024 at KubeCon in Paris. It was an incredible place to start!
  The OpenTofu Day schedule is built around the assumption that the audience has prior
  experience with OpenTofu, Terraform, or other infrastructure as code. Having this
  experience is not required to attend, but it will definitely help to get the most
  out of the event. As such, it is best for DevOps engineers, platform engineers,
  and infrastructure leadership, especially for those looking to migrate from Terraform
  in 2026. This year we focus less on what it took to get the project off the ground,
  and more on what is in store for the community, and sharing community experiences
  with the project in production. The event kicks off with a summary of the progress
  of the project, new features, growth, and new additions to the core team. Then we
  have the devs expand on that with a live panel, followed by community members sharing
  their experiences and learned lessons with the project. It would be best if you
  have already downloaded and used OpenTofu. What’s more, if you migrated from Terraform.'
