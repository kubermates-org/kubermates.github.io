  Open hybrid cloud Security Edge computing Infrastructure Applications Virtualization
  Share Driven by the need for agility, security, and sovereignty, the defence sector
  is undergoing a rapid digital transformation. Military organizations are increasingly
  operating across a hybrid infrastructure, spanning the strategic core, deployed
  edge, and tactical edge, while maintaining absolute control over their systems.
  However, this evolution presents significant challenges, from siloed technologies
  to cybersecurity threats. Defence organizations must navigate these obstacles by
  adopting a unified platform approach, leveraging an open framework based on open
  standards to strengthen autonomy, security, and seamless operations across all environments.
  Traditionally, defence operations began in the strategic core, which were large,
  on-premise data centers disconnected from the internet. These handled everything
  from mission planning to logistics. The first wave of transformation introduced
  private cloud solutions, allowing military organizations to scale infrastructure
  dynamically while maintaining digital sovereignty. Many defence entities remain
  cautious about using the public cloud due to security concerns, opting instead for
  air-gapped private clouds—physically isolated environments within their facilities—so
  only screened personnel and verified secure networks have access. Today, the focus
  has shifted to edge computing, highlighting the need for smarter, real-time, and
  autonomous decision-making in the field. Defence organizations now operate across
  two key edge environments, the deployed edge and the tactical edge. The deployed
  edge consists of mini data centres, capable of running mission-critical applications,
  processing intelligence and supporting AI workloads. Meanwhile, the tactical edge
  encompasses lightweight, ruggedized devices such as drones, autonomous vehicles,
  and soldier-worn systems that can collect, analyse, and act on data in real time,
  often completely disconnected from central networks.'
