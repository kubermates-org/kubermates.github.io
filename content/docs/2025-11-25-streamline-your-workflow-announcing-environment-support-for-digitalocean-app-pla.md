  we also know that as an application portfolio grows, managing it gets complicated.
  The line between your production services, your staging environment, and your new
  feature-branch deployments can blur. Keeping track of which app serves which purpose
  and quickly identifying all your “production” apps at a glance becomes a significant
  organizational challenge. We’re excited to announce a powerful new way to manage
  this complexity: Environment Support for DigitalOcean App Platform, powered by DigitalOcean
  Projects. We’re also introducing App Cloning , a new feature to replicate your apps
  in just a few clicks. This feature allows you to explicitly tag your resource groups
  (Projects) with a specific environment, such as Development, Staging, or Production
  and then assign your App Platform apps to those projects. This gives you a high-level,
  filterable view of your entire application landscape, right from the control panel
  and via the CLI. The logic is simple but effective: A Project is a “bucket” for
  your resources. You can group Droplets, Load Balancers, Databases, and App Platform
  Apps into a single Project. A Project is a “bucket” for your resources. You can
  group Droplets, Load Balancers, Databases, and App Platform Apps into a single Project.
  A Project can now be assigned an environment.'
