  Certified Distinguished Expert (VCDX): The Certification for Private Cloud Experts
  VMware Cloud Foundation 9: Now Ready For All Storage From Tickets to Clicks: Driving
  Real Consumption in Your Self‑Service Private Cloud For over almost two decades,
  the VMware Certified Design Expert certification has stood as the pinnacle measurement
  for architects mastering VMware solutions – a globally recognized achievement of
  elite expertise. But as the private cloud landscape accelerates and our community’s
  needs evolve, we’re not just adapting – we’re revolutionizing. We are thrilled to
  announce the evolution of this iconic program, expanding its reach beyond traditional
  focus on design roles to welcome a broader range of elite VMware professionals:
  Architects, Administrators, and Support specialists. To reflect this expanded vision,
  we are proudly renaming it the VMware Certified Distinguished Expert (VCDX). This
  isn’t just an update, it is a strategic re-imagining of our VCDX program, designed
  specifically for individuals like you who aspire to actively define the future of
  the private cloud. It is also an invitation to build on your deep VMware knowledge,
  push conventional limits, and pioneer the next generation of private cloud environments,
  and help pioneer the next generation of private cloud environments. “As VCDX #1
  and a founding supporter since 2007, I can attest that the VMware VCDX program is
  not just a certification—it is the definitive, peer-vetted validation for a distinguished
  expert. ” – John Arrasjid, VCDX #1 The need for specialized modern cloud expertise
  has never been more crucial. With 76% of enterprises planning to expand cloud services
  through private cloud, as highlighted in the Flexera 2024 State of the Cloud Report,
  the demand for profound cloud intelligence is rapidly accelerating. Yet, a critical
  challenge persists: a pervasive cloud skills gap. A staggering 95% of IT decision-makers
  said the cloud skills gap negatively impacted their team, leading to slower innovation
  and increased operational costs. Even more alarming, nearly a third of organizations
  are actively jeopardizing their bottom line, having missed their financial objectives
  due to this critical cloud skills gap.'
