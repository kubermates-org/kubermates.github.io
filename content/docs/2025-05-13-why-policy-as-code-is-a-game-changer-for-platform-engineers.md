summary: 'Platform engineers, let’s talk about a fundamental shift that’s revolutionizing
  how we build and manage internal developer platforms: Policy as Code (PaC). This
  isn’t just another buzzword; it’s the key to creating scalable, secure, and efficient
  operations that empower developers. Let’s dive in! Platform engineers, let’s talk
  about a fundamental shift that’s revolutionizing how we build and manage internal
  developer platforms: Policy as Code (PaC). This isn’t just another buzzword; it’s
  the key to creating scalable, secure, and efficient operations that empower developers.
  Let’s dive in! Policy as Code drastically improves developer experience. By implementing
  policy checks early in the development process (“shifting left”), developers get
  instant feedback on potential issues. This prevents problems from reaching production
  and reduces mental load, allowing them to focus on innovation, not compliance headaches.
  Platform engineering is about giving developers self-service capabilities. Infrastructure
  as Code (IaC) provides automation, but Policy as Code (PaC) provides the critical
  guardrails. Developers can provision resources and deploy applications within defined
  “golden paths,” ensuring agility without compromising security or compliance. Policies
  written as code are stored in version control, creating a clear history of changes.
  This auditability is essential for troubleshooting and demonstrating compliance.'
