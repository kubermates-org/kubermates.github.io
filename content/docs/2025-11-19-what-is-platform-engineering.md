  with other traditional models (ticket ops vs. self-service) The benefits of platform

  Natália Granato, CNCF Ambassador Platform engineering is a discipline focused on
  building and maintaining software development platforms that provide self-service
  for developer teams, offering the necessary infrastructure for provisioning an application,
  for example. The entire flow of development, testing, documentation, deployment,
  rollback, etc. , can happen through developer self-service. It emerged from the
  need to overcome the limitations of traditional software development, which was
  often characterized by slow cycles, isolated teams, silos, and complex infrastructures.
  The main goal of Platform Engineering is to improve the developer experience (DevEx)
  and optimize software delivery. In essence, platform engineering seeks to: Provide
  standardized tools and services: Create a set of tools, services, and workflows
  that developers can easily use to build, deploy, and manage their applications.
  These tools can include IDEs, CLIs, project templates, code versioning, CI/CD pipelines,
  container orchestration tools, configuration management tools, and observability
  systems. Reduce complexity: Abstract the complexity of the underlying infrastructure
  and operations, allowing developers to focus on code and business logic. The growing
  complexity of infrastructure, the cloud computing era with different providers and
  vendors, multi-cloud adoption, and the proliferation of tools and artifacts in the
  “everything as code” era led to an increase in developers’ cognitive load. The lack
  of design patterns also became a problem. Increase productivity: Accelerate the
  development and deployment cycle, eliminating bottlenecks and repetitive tasks.'
