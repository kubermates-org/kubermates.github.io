  plans? At the turn of the century, a whole family might share the same pool of mobile
  phone minutes, and it only took a few hours of idle chatter on the phone to drain
  the account of all remaining minutes of talk time for everyone. Well, a similar
  phenomenon is currently happening in the cloud today. Anyone who''s ever touched
  a public cloud has likely encountered an accidental overage payment. That''s a problem,
  but it''s even more problematic that it''s deceptively easy to overlook a single
  instance of this when you''re dealing in hundreds at a time. At Discover, the financial
  services company recently acquired by Capital One, developers found a way to solve
  their overage problems—and implement serious cost savings. It’s not surprising that
  a company offering credit cards would understand the value of cost optimization
  in the cloud. What is surprising, however, is that in those two days, they managed
  to cut their cloud bill by $1.4 million each year. Discover moved onto Red Hat OpenShift
  in 2022. Prior to that, the company had been attempting to solidify on CloudFoundry,
  the Platform-as-a-Service often promoted by Pivotal, VMware, and Broadcom. Craig
  Katz, OpenShift Director at Discover, said that Discover now uses OpenShift to manage
  its container infrastructure inside of Amazon Web Services. In order to migrate
  their existing 1,200 workloads to OpenShift and Amazon Web Services, the decision
  was made early on to focus on the speed and quality of the transition, and to push
  cost concerns to the side. As Katz put it, "You can choose two: fast, cheap, or
  good.'
