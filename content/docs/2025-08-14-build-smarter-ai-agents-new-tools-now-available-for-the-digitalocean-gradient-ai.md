summary: "By Grace Morgan Building with AI should be fast, flexible, and frustration-free.\
  \ Thatâ\x80\x99s why weâ\x80\x99ve leveled up the Gradient AI Platform with new\
  \ tools that let you ship smarter agents, debug in real time, and tap into the knowledge\
  \ sources you already use. Now you can: Streamline AI app development with the unified\
  \ Gradient AI Python SDK -> Optimize agent performance via log stream insights ->\
  \ Augment your agents with Dropbox knowledge bases -> Whether youâ\x80\x99re launching\
  \ your first AI MVP or scaling production workloads, these new tools help you build\
  \ real, production-ready AI apps. Access all major Gradient AI services, like Agents,\
  \ Inference APIs, Knowledge Bases, and even GPU Droplets , through one modern Python\
  \ SDK, now available on PyPI. No more jumping between tools or stitching together\
  \ API calls. The Gradient AI SDK gives you a unified way to access end-to-end AI\
  \ building blocks, from bare metal GPU infrastructure to a complete agent builder,\
  \ perfect for quick prototyping, scalable backends, or custom internal tools. Explore\
  \ the SDK -> To install the SDK: When your agent isnâ\x80\x99t behaving how it should,\
  \ combing through logs can slow you down. Log Stream Insights helps you skip the\
  \ guesswork by analyzing your agent trace data in real timeâ\x80\x94and surfacing\
  \ optimization recommendations automatically. If youâ\x80\x99re already storing\
  \ traces, you can turn on Insights with a single toggleâ\x80\x94and start seeing\
  \ recommendations instantly. Add Log Stream Insights â\x86\x92 Your team already\
  \ stores knowledge in Dropbox, why not use it to power your agents? With the new\
  \ Dropbox Data Connector, you can ingest content directly from Dropbox into your\
  \ Gradient knowledge bases. Use it to build onboarding assistants, search agents,\
  \ or custom copilots grounded in your docs. Connect Dropbox data â\x86\x92 We built\
  \ these tools to meet you where you areâ\x80\x94and help you level up."
