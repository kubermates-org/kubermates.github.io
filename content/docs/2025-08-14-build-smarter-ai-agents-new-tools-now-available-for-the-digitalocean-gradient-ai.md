  \ agent performance via log stream insights -> Augment your agents with Dropbox\
  \ knowledge bases -> Augment your agents with Dropbox knowledge bases -> Whether\
  \ youâ\x80\x99re launching your first AI MVP or scaling production workloads, these\
  \ new tools help you build real, production-ready AI apps. Access all major Gradient\
  \ AI services, like Agents, Inference APIs, Knowledge Bases, and even GPU Droplets\
  \ , through one modern Python SDK, now available on PyPI. Fully typed with Pydantic\
  \ and TypedDict for IDE support and reliability Async and sync support, including\
  \ real-time streaming via SSE Built-in error handling, retries, and custom transport\
  \ configuration One install: pip install do-gradientai No more jumping between tools\
  \ or stitching together API calls. The Gradient AI SDK gives you a unified way to\
  \ access end-to-end AI building blocks, from bare metal GPU infrastructure to a\
  \ complete agent builder, perfect for quick prototyping, scalable backends, or custom\
  \ internal tools. Explore the SDK -> To install the SDK: pip install --pre gradient\
  \ pip install --pre gradient When your agent isnâ\x80\x99t behaving how it should,\
  \ combing through logs can slow you down. Log Stream Insights helps you skip the\
  \ guesswork by analyzing your agent trace data in real timeâ\x80\x94and surfacing\
  \ optimization recommendations automatically. Reduce costs and latency with real-time,\
  \ AI-generated suggestions Improve agent performance with actionable insights for\
  \ prompt design, model selection, and token use Pay-as-you-go with usage-based pricing\
  \ Integrate seamlessly with existing Agent Traceability tools for complete visibility\
  \ If youâ\x80\x99re already storing traces, you can turn on Insights with a single\
  \ toggleâ\x80\x94and start seeing recommendations instantly. Add Log Stream Insights\
  \ â\x86\x92 Your team already stores knowledge in Dropbox, why not use it to power\
  \ your agents? With the new Dropbox Data Connector, you can ingest content directly\
  \ from Dropbox into your Gradient knowledge bases. Supports 7 formats: PDF, DOC,\
  \ TXT, CSV, HTML, JSON, and Markdown Ingest in bulk or sync updates via API OAuth-secured\
  \ access and encrypted data transfer Indexed automatically in OpenSearch for fast\
  \ querying Use it to build onboarding assistants, search agents, or custom copilots\
  \ grounded in your docs. Connect Dropbox data â\x86\x92 We built these tools to\
  \ meet you where you areâ\x80\x94and help you level up."
