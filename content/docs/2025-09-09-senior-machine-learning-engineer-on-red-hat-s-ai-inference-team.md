  D. is a senior machine learning (ML) engineer on our AI Inference team, which is
  part of the broader AI Engineering team at Red Hat. Based remotely in Chicago, Brian
  helps maintain LLM Compressor , a key component of vLLM (an open source inference
  server originally developed at UC Berkeley, and now supported by a global community).
  vLLM is designed to make AI inference —in other words, responses from models—more
  efficient. Through LLM Compressor, Brian and his team make it possible to optimize
  and deploy LLMs so they run faster, consume less energy, and operate on fewer GPUs,
  without compromising performance. The resulting impact? Lower computational barriers
  to working with AI—which, in turn, opens the door for more organizations, researchers,
  and innovators to use these models in meaningful ways. We sat down with Brian to
  learn more about his journey, his team, and life as a ML engineer. Tell us about
  your journey to Red Hat and AI I joined Red Hat in January through the acquisition
  of Neural Magic. I was actually in the middle of the interview process with Neural
  Magic when the acquisition was announced. It was great timing: my first week was
  the same week the entire Neural Magic team met in Boston for Red Hat’s new hire
  orientation. I’ve been in the AI/ML field for several years, but I’m still new to
  this role at Red Hat. My career path has been a gradual shift toward AI.'
