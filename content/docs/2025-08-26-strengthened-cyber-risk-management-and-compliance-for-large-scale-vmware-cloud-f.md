  your GenAI Agents on VCF with Private AI Services Is data an organization’s most
  valuable asset, or biggest liability? The ever-evolving risks presented by today’s
  modern threat landscape pose unprecedented challenges that most today are ill-equipped
  to address. With ransomware attacks becoming increasingly sophisticated and regulatory
  guidelines more stringent, cyber-risk management and compliance lie at the core
  of every strategic IT decision made by C-Suite executives and board members. 51%
  of leaders reported security, data protection and privacy as key priorities to enable
  compliant operations 1. However, the path to achieve successful outcomes is beset
  with obstacles. Why Organizations Struggle to Manage Cyber-Risk and Maintain Compliance
  Reactive vs. Proactive Response: data is scattered across different applications
  in multiple geographic locations, each with its own rules and regulations. 63% of
  organizations report that complexity from the disaggregated nature of data as the
  main challenge to maintain compliance 2. Policy monitoring for virtual machines
  (VMs), containers, databases, infrastructure and technology stack components is
  siloed, which hinders early detection of drifts and leads to a reactive versus proactive
  response. Manual Remediation and Recovery: policy management and recovery lack automation,
  which directly impacts an organization’s ability to scale operations and preserve
  compliance as applications are changed, moved or deleted. Intense manual intervention
  inevitably delays time to audit-readiness and leaves unaddressed gaps that could
  expose critical workloads to increased damage. Stitching of Multiple Tools: consolidation
  of cyber-risk management, resilience and recovery is easier said than done. Most
  organizations rely on a piecemeal approach, plagued with operational complexity
  and inefficiencies that increase chances of human error.'
