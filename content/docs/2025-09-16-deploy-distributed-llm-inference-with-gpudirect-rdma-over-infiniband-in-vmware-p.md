  58: A Smarter Way to a Unified Private Cloud Consumption Experience with VCF 9.0
  At the VMware Explore 2025 keynote, Chris Wolf announced DirectPath enablement for
  GPUs with VMware Private AI , marking a major step forward in simplifying and scaling
  enterprise AI infrastructure. By granting VMs exclusive, high-performance access
  to NVIDIA GPUs, DirectPath allows organizations to fully harness GPU capabilities
  without added licensing complexity. This makes it easier to experiment, prototype,
  and move AI projects into production with confidence. Besides, VMware Private AI
  brings models closer to enterprise data, delivering secure, efficient, and cost-effective
  deployments. Jointly engineered by Broadcom and NVIDIA, the solution empowers organizations
  to accelerate innovation while reducing total cost of ownership (TCO). These advancements
  come at a critical time. Serving state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs) like
  DeepSeek-R1 , Meta Llama-3.1-405B-Instruct , and Qwen3-235B-A22B-thinking at full
  context length often exceeds the capacity of a single 8x H100 GPU server, making
  distributed inference essential. Aggregating resources from multiple GPU-enabled
  nodes allows these models to run efficiently, though it introduces new challenges
  in infrastructure management, interconnect optimization, and workload scheduling.
  This is where VMware Cloud Foundation (VCF) plays a vital role. VCF is the industry’s
  first private cloud platform to deliver public cloud scale and agility while providing
  on-premises security, resilience, and performance—all with lower TCO. Leveraging
  technologies such as NVIDIA NVLink , NVSwitch , and GPUDirect® RDMA , VCF enables
  high-bandwidth, low-latency communication across nodes. It also ensures that network
  interconnects like InfiniBand (IB) and RoCEv2 (RDMA over Converged Ethernet) are
  used effectively, reducing communication overhead that can limit distributed inference
  performance.'
