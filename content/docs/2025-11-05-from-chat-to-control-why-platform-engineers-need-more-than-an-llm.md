  Forward Large Language Models (LLMs) like ChatGPT, Claude, and tools like Cursor
  are transforming how developers write and debug code. They autocomplete YAML, summarize
  logs, and even generate Kubernetes manifests. But for platform engineers, the mission
  isn’t just about writing code — it’s about governing, securing, and optimizing the
  systems that run it. And that’s where today’s LLMs fall short. It’s tempting to
  believe that adding an LLM to your workflow instantly makes your platform team more
  productive. But platform engineering requires precision, auditability, and control,
  not just good guesses. When managing clusters, pipelines, and cloud environments,
  every action must be traceable, validated, and compliant with security and regulatory
  standards. General-purpose LLMs weren’t designed for that. Let’s break down why.
  LLMs understand text — not systems. They don’t have live visibility into your clusters,
  GitOps pipelines, or policy baselines. So while they can generate YAML or Terraform,
  they can’t tell if it will actually pass admission control or align with organizational
  standards.'
