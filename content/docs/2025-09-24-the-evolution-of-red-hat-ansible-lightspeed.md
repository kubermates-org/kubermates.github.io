  Virtualization Share Today we''re formally releasing the Red Hat Ansible Lightspeed
  intelligent assistant, a generative AI service which delivers an intuitive chat
  assistant embedded within Ansible Automation Platform. The Ansible Lightspeed intelligent
  assistant is like having an Ansible subject matter expert right at your keyboard.
  The service integrates documentation directly into the Ansible administrative and
  operations experience for faster troubleshooting and onboarding, as well as support
  for the day-to-day management of your automation itself. Ansible Lightspeed intelligent
  assistant within Ansible Automation Platform This generative AI service is a result
  of a concerted effort by our product and engineering teams to improve the overall
  platform user experience for both automation administrators and IT operators. Examples
  of this include a simplified and unified UI, the release of self-service automation
  to empower more users, a new on-premise analytics dashboard to measure performance,
  a fleet of new collections for managing the platform, and more. When we initially
  launched Red Hat Ansible Lightspeed with IBM watsonx Code Assistant in 2023, its
  purpose was to provide a robust coding assistant designed to help boost engineering
  and developer productivity during the creation of Ansible content, including playbooks,
  roles or tasks. We later embedded features such as content explanation and content
  source matching for greater transparency and context for model responses as well
  as prompt refinement and model customization for greater relevance and accuracy.
  Tapping into IBM''s Granite code models and trained on Ansible-specific data sources,
  the coding assistant democratizes access to automation and helps onboard new users
  as they familiarize themselves with the Ansible language and syntax. With the intelligent
  assistant, we bring similar value to Ansible Automation Platform administrators
  and operators by reducing friction and swivel-chair operations, allowing these users
  to remain within the platform experience to research, troubleshoot, and resolve
  common questions and issues. The intelligent assistant can respond to prompts like:
  "What is an execution environment?" "How do I manage user access to Ansible Automation
  Platform?" "Explain the "ERROR! couldn’t resolve module/action” error message?"
  "How do I configure Event-Driven Ansible?" Using a retrieval augmented generation
  (RAG) pipeline connected to Red Hat documentation and other resources, the intelligent
  assistant also provides referenced links to additional documentation to help you
  explore a given topic in more detail. Ansible Lightspeed intelligent assistant prompt,
  response, and referenced resources Additional roadmap items for the intelligent
  assistant include expanding data sources to provide visibility into the health and
  performance of your automation itself. For instance, you will be able to get assistance
  with prompts such as: "Why did my automation ''VM-migration'' job fail?" "Show me
  all inventories that are included in my Ansible Automation Platform deployment.'
