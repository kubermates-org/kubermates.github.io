  today are under immense pressure to modernize applications while maintaining the
  performance, reliability, and security that their business demands. One question
  continues to surface: How do containers and virtual machines (VMs) fit together
  in a modern IT strategy? A new IDC White Paper, The Convergence of Containers and
  VMs in Modern IT Infrastructure: Simplification with a Single Platform , by Gary
  Chen who is the Research Director at IDC, provides clarity on this topic. There’s
  a common misconception that containers will eventually replace VMs. IDC’s research
  shows the opposite: VMs and containers are complementary technologies that solve
  different problems and will continue to coexist for the long term: VMs provide strong
  workload isolation, security boundaries, and efficient server consolidation. Containers
  deliver speed, portability, and consistent deployment for cloud-native applications.
  IDC forecasts that nearly 85% of all containers will continue running inside VMs
  through 2028 because enterprises trust the virtualization layer for governance,
  security, and operational control. As organizations scale modern application initiatives,
  they often find themselves managing two separate worlds: traditional VM-based apps
  and fast-growing containerized workloads. This creates silos, duplicate tooling,
  inconsistent policies, and operational friction. IDC’s paper highlights that the
  most resilient and efficient organizations are shifting to a single platform approach
  that integrates both VMs and containers across a unified infrastructure. A unified
  platform enables: Operational simplicity : One set of tools and consistent workflows
  for provisioning, lifecycle management, networking, and security Stronger security
  and governance : Enterprise-grade isolation for workloads with consistent policies
  Greater efficiency and flexibility : Platform engineers gain self-service access
  to all infrastructure resources, VMs, and containers Faster app modernization :
  App teams can modernize at their own pace, containerizing parts of an application
  while keeping others in VMs VMware pioneered enterprise virtualization and now,
  as part of Broadcom, offers a complete platform for running VMs and containers together,
  delivering consistency from infrastructure to application. With vSphere Kubernetes
  Service (VKS), organizations gain a powerful Kubernetes runtime built directly into
  VMware Cloud Foundation, offering: A CNCF-certified Kubernetes distribution that
  ensures upstream compatibility, ecosystem portability, and alignment with the latest
  community innovations Unified networking, storage, and security , tightly integrated
  with NSX and vSAN, to provide consistent policies, automated provisioning, and end-to-end
  workload protection Consistent operations across the private cloud, whether deployed
  on-premises, at the edge, or on a hyperscaler cloud , enabling platform teams to
  deploy, manage, and scale Kubernetes clusters with the same tools and processes
  they use for VMs Enterprise-grade robustness and security , backed by VMware’s decades
  of platform hardening, patch management, and Zero Trust architecture capabilities
  This unique combination enables customers to modernize with confidence, leveraging
  containers where they excel and VMs where they remain essential. As IDC concludes,
  containers and VMs are distinct layers of the stack, each indispensable to modern
  enterprise IT.'
