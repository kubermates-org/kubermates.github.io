  Automation Artificial intelligence Open hybrid cloud Security Edge computing Infrastructure
  Applications Virtualization Share For the telecommunications (telco) industry, the
  time to modernize is now. Telco service providers face intense pressure to deliver
  new digital services faster, while improving agility and cutting cost. By modernizing
  with advanced network systems and automation, telcos can remain competitive while
  increasing revenue, optimizing costs, and enhancing security and resilience. However,
  every telco service provider’s cloud journey is unique, with workload requirements
  like latency, throughput, and data locality dictating whether an application should
  run on premise or in the cloud. The collaboration between Red Hat, AWS, and Nokia
  creates a powerful solution to support these unique requirements. Together, they
  provide a clear framework to help service providers decide which workloads belong
  in the public cloud and which should remain on premise. Red Hat OpenShift Service
  on AWS delivers a managed application platform, tailored for the diverse and demanding
  telco industry, making it easier to shift applications to the cloud and support
  continuous innovation. Additionally, it provides the flexibility and consistency
  telcos need to manage workloads across diverse hybrid environments, significantly
  reducing their total cost of ownership (TCO) and accelerating innovation. This blog
  explores the primary motivators for cloud adoption, the benefits of Red Hat OpenShift
  Service on AWS, and a real-world success story that demonstrates its impact on achieving
  a clear path for infrastructure modernization and strategic goals, including improved
  cost savings, agility, and resilience. Service providers are using public cloud
  solutions to meet critical goals, including: Cost optimization: Shifting from capital-heavy
  hardware to an operational expenditure model cuts infrastructure and maintenance
  costs. Scalability and elasticity: Dynamic resource scaling handles demand spikes.
  Agility and speed: Quick deployment of services accelerates innovation and market
  responsiveness.'
