  partners, and associates—to share their knowledge and experiences. The call for
  proposals is open now through November 12. Submit your session proposal today for
  a chance to present at Red Hat Summit 2026. Learn more The new self-serve Red Hat
  Enterprise Linux (RHEL) on AWS Cloud Marketplace trial is now live! With the trial
  available in the cloud marketplace, it''s now easier for users to try and deploy
  RHEL directly within their existing AWS environments. Learn more Open source technology
  is vital for enterprise AI because it offers transparency, flexibility and control
  that closed "black-box" systems lack. While black-box systems are easy to start
  with, they can lead to issues like data bias, high costs, and a loss of digital
  sovereignty. Open source provides a way for organizations to adapt models with their
  own data, fostering a collaborative approach that is shaping the future of AI. Learn
  more Hitachi Vantara and Red Hat are collaborating on a new solution that combines
  Red Hat OpenShift Virtualization with Hitachi Vantara''s Virtual Storage Platform
  One. The offering helps companies modernize their aging virtualization environments
  by providing a unified, hybrid cloud platform that reduces reliance on costly, proprietary
  hypervisors and allows them to run VMs and containers side by side. Learn more Artificial
  intelligence is no longer just a tool for experiments — it is becoming the backbone
  of enterprise operations. Private AI, running where the data lives inside systems
  companies directly control, is reshaping how organizations build and manage their
  technology stacks. Learn more Red Hat is the world’s leading provider of enterprise
  open source software solutions, using a community-powered approach to deliver reliable
  and high-performing Linux, hybrid cloud, container, and Kubernetes technologies.'
