  the great work we’re doing to make it available to you through our products , and
  the importance of preparing for a future with quantum computers powerful enough
  to break classic RSA -based cryptography. You may have heard about “Q-day,” the
  day when a cryptographically relevant quantum computer (CRQC) is available to break
  public-key encryption–the underpinning of our digital world today. If you missed
  it, this risk is real, and proactive organizations are already preparing for it.
  Q-day is predicted to occur between 2029 and 2032, so now is the time to prepare.
  The core issue at hand is that many of our current cryptographic systems, like RSA,
  rely on mathematical problems that are simple for classical computers to do in one
  direction, but extremely difficult to reverse. For example, multiplying 2 large
  prime numbers is simple, but factoring the result back to its original prime numbers
  is very hard. This is modern public-key cryptography, also called asymmetric cryptography.
  In contrast, symmetric cryptography relies on a single shared secret key for both
  encryption and decryption and requires a secure method for sharing that secret key
  beforehand. With public-key cryptography being the most common and practical way
  for computers to share that secret, we must also be aware that CRQCs can weaken
  the effectiveness of symmetric keys in addition to compromising the most common
  method by which those keys are shared. CRQCs can do factoring at a scale and speed
  that is impossible with existing computers. Instead of multiple lifetimes, RSA can
  be broken in seconds. New cryptographic algorithms are needed to resist these new
  attacks, and those new algorithms (e.
