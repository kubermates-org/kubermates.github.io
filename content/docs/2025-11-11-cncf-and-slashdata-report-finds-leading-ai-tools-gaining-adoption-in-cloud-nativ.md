summary: 'New report provides maturity and recommendation scores for tools and projects
  across AI inference, ML orchestration, and agentic AI platforms Key Highlights:
  CNCF and SlashData’s new report highlights the top AI tools gaining traction in
  cloud native ecosystems, with NVIDIA Triton, Metaflow, Airflow, and Model Context
  Protocol leading in adoption and developer trust. For AI inference tools, NVIDIA
  Triton, DeepSpeed, TensorFlow Serving, and BentoML are the projects developers cumulatively
  placed in the adopt position. Further, NVIDIA Triton received the highest ratings
  for both maturity and usefulness. In the ML orchestration category, Airflow and
  Metaflow rose to the adopt position. Metaflow earned the highest maturity ratings,
  while Airflow had the highest usefulness ratings. In agentic AI platforms, Model
  Context Protocol (MCP) and Llama Stack reached the adopt classification. MCP leads
  on maturity and usefulness; meanwhile, Agent2Agent posted the highest recommendation
  score at 94%. ATLANTA, KUBECON + CLOUDNATIVECON NORTH AMERICA. – November 11, 2025
  – The Cloud Native Computing Foundation® (CNCF®), which builds sustainable ecosystems
  for cloud native software, released new findings from the Q4 2025 CNCF Technology
  Landscape Radar report with SlashData , uncovering insight on developers’ experience
  and opinions on AI inference tools and engines, agentic AI platforms and projects,
  and ML orchestration tools. “Organizations building and operating AI systems can’t
  treat tooling the way they did five years ago,” said Chris Aniszczyk, CTO, CNCF.
  “What this new research affirms is that cloud native principles from scalable infrastructure
  and orchestration are foundational not just for backend apps, but for inference
  pipelines and agentic AI systems. Choosing technologies rated ‘adopt’ helps reduce
  risk and increase productivity.'
