  \x99re excited to announce the launch of DigitalOceanâ\x80\x99s Managed Caching\
  \ for Valkey, our new Managed Database service that seamlessly replaces Managed\
  \ Caching (previously Managed RedisÂ®). Managed Caching for Valkey builds on the\
  \ capabilities youâ\x80\x99ve come to rely on while also offering enhanced tools\
  \ to support your development needs. DigitalOcean Managed Caching for Valkey is\
  \ a fully managed, high-performance, in-memory key-value datastore designed for\
  \ caching, message queues, and primary database use. Fully compatible with Valkey\
  \ 8.0 and Redis 7.2. 4Â® as a database, it serves as a drop-in replacement for our\
  \ Managed Caching database service while offering enhanced functionality for fast\
  \ and efficient data storage. Built for developers and growing businesses, Managed\
  \ Caching for Valkey helps reduce database load, improve response times, and optimize\
  \ resource usageâ\x80\x94delivering an easy-to-use, cost-effective alternative to\
  \ self-managed caching solutions. As for our current customers with Managed Caching\
  \ environments, Managed Caching will have an end-of-availability (EOA) date of April\
  \ 30, meaning you cannot create new clusters after this date, and April 29th is\
  \ when new Redis creates will be disabled. However, existing clusters will remain\
  \ operational, but we encourage you to explore our product documentation to learn\
  \ how to convert your Caching workloads to Valkey, step-by-step. DigitalOcean Managed\
  \ Caching for Valkey offers a wealth of benefits to the modern-day developer. Amongst\
  \ them all, these are the ones we think will be of the most value to you: A RedisÂ®-compatible\
  \ database: Valkey is a one-in replacement for Managed Caching, our previous RedisÂ®\
  \ Managed Database service. You will be able to seamlessly transfer your caching\
  \ clusters to Valkey with our extensive product documentation. A RedisÂ®-compatible\
  \ database: Valkey is a one-in replacement for Managed Caching, our previous RedisÂ®\
  \ Managed Database service."
