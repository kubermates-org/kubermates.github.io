summary: 'Welcome to Jenkins X 3. x alpha! We are very pleased to announce the alpha
  release of Jenkins X version 3 You can read more about the overview of the architecture
  and components here. This release has lots of benefits over version 2 is much easier
  to use, understand and manage. It is more flexible and simpler to configure for
  different infrastructures and cloud providers. The new release works well with any
  combination of helm 3, helmfile, kpt and/or kustomize. For those who’ve used Jenkins
  X version 2 you can check out a comparison of the two versions Here is a demo video
  showing how to get started with Jenkins X on Google Cloud with Terraform and Vault
  : We also did a live demo of getting started and using version 3 at the octant office
  hours last week. We also included the helmfile based preview environments enhancement
  via the new jx-preview plugin which makes it much easier to make more sophisticated
  previews such as using multiple namespaces for you previews using per preview namespaces
  or deploying previews into shared namespaces (e. g. via Canaries) using helmfile
  to cleanly remove resources We now have support, via Terraform for 2 of the big
  3 public clouds: Amazon Google Azure support is getting really close; if you’d like
  to help get it ready join us on slack Also when using your laptop or local kubernetes
  cluster without terraform we support: Minikube so you can run Jenkins X on your
  laptop On-Premises so you can use any vanilla kubernetes cluster We are working
  on improving the UX of the installation/upgrade; we’re hoping to soon have a pure
  terraform (or Terraform Cloud) way to spin up a Jenkins X installation on a public
  cloud with a minimum of fuss. We’ll hopefully blog about that soon… So please take
  it for a spin and let us know what you think ! If you can think of any ways we can
  improve let us know! ← Previous.'
