  The process of upgrading to VMware Cloud Foundation (VCF) 9.0 depends on the version
  of VCF that you’re currently running as well as a mix of environmental, software
  and hardware considerations. For example, a specific hardware requirement may have
  changed and is no longer supported in a later version of VCF. The upgrade process
  for VCF 5. x has several different paths depending on the starting footprint of
  the environment. The steps vary depending on which existing VMware Aria Automation
  and VMware Aria Operations components need to be deployed or upgraded in the environment,
  as well as any remediations which may be required to the VMware vSphere components.
  This blog walks through the typical process that VCF Professional Services uses
  to assess, plan and perform upgrades from VCF 5. x to VCF 9. The first step is to
  assess and validate the environment. This includes the following: Validate the existing
  component configuration. This includes checking software components that are installed,
  their versions, and configuration specifics. For existing Aria Automation and Aria
  Operations deployments, you must be on the latest release.'
