  with Red Hat''s tailored solution for resource-constrained environments Edge computing
  presents unique challenges that demand strategic technology decisions. With Red
  Hat''s expanding portfolio of edge solutions, organizations often find themselves
  weighing multiple options: deploy standard Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL), opt
  for Red Hat Device Edge , or implement Red Hat OpenShift at the edge? Whether you''re
  planning your first edge deployment or optimizing an existing infrastructure, we’ll
  help you evaluate where Red Hat Device Edge fits into your strategy. This is a big
  topic, so we’re breaking it into 2 parts: Part 1 (this post): A decision framework
  to help you figure out when Red Hat Device Edge makes sense, how it stacks up against
  RHEL and Red Hat OpenShift, and where MicroShift fits in edge environments. Part
  2 : An in-depth look into management strategies for Red Hat Device Edge—from package-based
  vs. image-based deployments to automation tools and how Red Hat Edge Manager is
  changing the game. At the end of this series, you’ll have a clear framework for
  making informed decisions about Red Hat Device Edge adoption and feel prepared to
  effectively manage it. Red Hat Device Edge might sound like a completely new product,
  but here''s the interesting part: it''s actually RHEL with a twist. Red Hat Device
  Edge binaries are identical to RHEL, but Red Hat Device Edge adds subscription-level
  differences and support entitlements. In other words, there''s no technical difference
  between Red Hat Device Edge and RHEL; the magic lies in the subscription packaging
  and pricing strategy designed specifically for edge computing scenarios.'
