  Mapping the Attack Flow Detailed Summary of the Blocked Events Summary Indications
  of Compromise (IOCs) Aqua Nautilus researchers have discovered a new attack campaign
  targeting interactive computing environments such as Jupyter Notebooks. The attack
  consists of multiple stages, beginning with the download of a compressed file from
  a remote server. Once executed, the attacker deploys several malicious tools to
  exploit the server and establish persistence. This campaign poses a significant
  risk to cloud-native environments, as it enables unauthorized access and long-term
  control over compromised systems. Jupyter Notebooks In this blog, we will outline
  the attack stages, discuss the potential risks, and provide recommendations to strengthen
  security and prevent exploitation. Interactive Computing Environments or Notebook
  Interfaces are platforms designed for data scientists and programmers to write,
  execute, and analyze code interactively. There are many products available, including
  Jupyter Notebook , JupyterLab , Apache Zeppelin , Google Colab , Databricks Notebooks
  , and others. These environments are often connected to the internet and require
  authentication to access data or execute code. However, a simple misconfiguration
  can sometimes expose the server to malicious activity by hackers. Jupyter Notebook

  attack flow The attackers gained initial access through an unauthenticated JupyterLab
  instance, allowing them to deploy malware and cryptominers. They first downloaded
  and extracted a compressed archive containing 13 malicious files, consisting of
  both binaries and shell scripts. Once executed, these scripts initiated multiple
  processes to establish persistence, hijack system resources for cryptomining, and
  evade detection (as shown in Figure 1).'
