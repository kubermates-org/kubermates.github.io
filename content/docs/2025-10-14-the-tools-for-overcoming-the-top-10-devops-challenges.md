  this post DevOps is a way of working that reduces waste. It uses smart tools and
  practices to build, test, and ship software faster. It makes teams quicker, systems
  stronger and problems smaller when done right. It’s not just one thing – it’s about
  making the whole machine run better. But this means that DevOps is not just a toolset
  or process. It’s a way of thinking and a culture born from the need to fix something
  broken: the wall between developers and operations. Companies understand the value
  DevOps brings to projects – which explains why its market value is growing so fast.
  In 2020, it was worth about $4.3 billion. A year later, its value rose to $5.1 billion.
  If the pace holds, it will hit $12.2 billion by 2026. That’s almost tripled in six
  years. Teams understand what DevOps brings to projects.'
