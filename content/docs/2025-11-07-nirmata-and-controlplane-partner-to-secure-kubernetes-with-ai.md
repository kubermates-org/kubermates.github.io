  Nirmata AI Platform Engineer Assistant? Why Enterprises Need AI-Driven Policy Enforcement
  Inside the Nirmata AI Control Hub ControlPlane: Kubernetes Security Experts The
  Synergy: Policy, Practice, and Protection Innovation Without Compromise In today’s
  fast-paced world of cloud-native development , Kubernetes has become the de facto
  operating system of the cloud. But with great power comes great complexity —especially
  around security and governance. That’s why our collaboration with ControlPlane is
  so critical for modern organizations. While we both tackle distinct areas, combining
  Nirmata’s policy-as-code platform with ControlPlane’s deep Kubernetes security consulting,
  GitOps expertise, and defense solutions creates a robust, end-to-end security strategy
  that helps teams move faster and safer. Nirmata is the AI Platform Engineer’s assistant
  , powered by Kyverno , the leading open-source Policy-as-Code engine. Nirmata’s
  core function is to turn policy-as-code into automated governance for security,
  compliance, cost, and reliability across any infrastructure. It uses AI agents that
  work together to close the loop from detection to remediation to enforcement. Today’s
  enterprises face four realities: Scale and Complexity : Hundreds of clusters, thousands
  of nodes, and sprawling IaC repositories make manual enforcement impossible. Rising
  Regulatory Pressure : From finance to healthcare, industries must prove compliance
  across both Kubernetes and IaC environments. Operational Burnout : Platform and
  security teams are inundated with violations, alerts, and repetitive toil. Inconsistent
  Rules : Disparate and even contradictory policies Without automation, compliance
  becomes a bottleneck. AI for platform engineering flips this equation on its head.'
