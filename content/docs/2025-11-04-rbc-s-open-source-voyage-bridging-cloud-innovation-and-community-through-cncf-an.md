summary: 'Innovating within a regulated landscape Our open source milestones Looking
  ahead with CNCF Posted on November 4, 2025 by Thomas Cooper, Royal Bank of Canada
  At Royal Bank of Canada (RBC), our cloud journey is intrinsically linked with our
  commitment to open source. Joining the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF)
  extends and compliments our membership with the Fintech Open Source Foundation (FINOS),
  also a part of the Linux Foundation, and exemplifies our dedication to advancing
  cloud-native technologies through our involvement with open source and cloud native
  ecosystems. Through our work with CNCF, our cloud platform engineering teams actively
  engage with and contribute to key cloud native projects—both within the CNCF umbrella,
  such as Backstage, and outside the foundation. This is not just about adopting these
  technologies but also about bringing our unique perspective to help shape and influence
  their direction. RBC has established a controlled contribution process that adheres
  to our internal standards and policies. This process allows our developers to engage
  with the open source ecosystem, fostering innovation while ensuring compliance.
  At the heart of our contribution strategy is GitProxy, a tool originally developed
  by Citi and contributed to FINOS. This proxy interception app uses familiar tools,
  such as version control systems, and enables our teams to contribute to open source
  Git repositories while meeting strict security and compliance standards. Fun fact:
  we were not content merely submitting the occasional bug report or patch to GitProxy
  as part of operationalizing our process. Our OSPO, in collaboration with Citi and
  other FINOS members and collaborators, is a co-maintainer of the project to ensure
  it continues to thrive. RBC plays a vital role in the ongoing development and enhancement
  of this project, which is crucial for the enablement of open source development
  within our organization. Using open source tools such as GitProxy and Backstage,
  RBC has onboarded 36 open source projects into our secure contribution process,
  with 15 developers approved across the enterprise to contribute to open source.'
