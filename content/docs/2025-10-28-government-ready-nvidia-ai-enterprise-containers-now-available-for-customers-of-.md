  Now Available for Customers of VMware Private AI Foundation with NVIDIA Analyst
  Insight Series: Consolidated, Consistent and Simplified Operations Deliver on The
  Promise of Platform Engineering We’re excited to announce a major milestone in our
  mission to bring secure, enterprise-grade AI to regulated industries. Starting today,
  VMware Private AI Foundation with NVIDIA is part of the NVIDIA AI Factory for Government
  reference design. This reference design is based on NVIDIA accelerated compute and
  NVIDIA AI Enterprise , and now includes government-ready software that meets security
  requirements for use within high assurance deployments. With this new reference
  design, VMware Private AI Foundation with NVIDIA customers can deploy GenAI workloads
  more securely to meet the requirements of regulated industries. Generative AI is
  reshaping industries; however, government agencies, defense, healthcare and financial
  institutions face unique challenges: Sensitive data can be locked in secure enclaves
  governed by strict compliance frameworks such as FedRAMP, FISMA, and NIST 800-53.
  Deploying Generative AI (GenAI) agents (e. g. , research assistants, chatbots) in
  these environments requires bespoke engineering, manual hardening, and non-repeatable
  processes. These barriers prevent regulated users from realizing the full benefits
  of GenAI and agentic AI. To support AI deployments for the public sector and other
  regulated industries, the NVIDIA AI Factory for Government reference design which
  includes the latest NVIDIA AI Enterprise release, provides guidance to deploy AI
  workloads. It is: Built on STIG hardened configurations and requirements for containers
  Uses FIPS validated cryptographic modules and related capabilities Is subject to
  ongoing monitoring and remediation of vulnerabilities including CISA KEVs By leveraging
  this secure, performant reference design through VMware Private AI Foundation with
  NVIDIA, customers can confidently harness the power of AI to achieve their goals
  faster and more securely. VMware Private AI Foundation with NVIDIA , a joint AI
  platform between Broadcom and NVIDIA, enables enterprises to run RAG workflows,
  fine-tune and customize LLM models, and run inference workloads in their data centers,
  addressing privacy, choice, cost, performance and compliance concerns.'
