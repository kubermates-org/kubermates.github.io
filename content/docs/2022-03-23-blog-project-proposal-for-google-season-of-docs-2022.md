summary: We have put together a project proposal as part of our application to participate
  in the Google Season of Docs 2022 program. Jenkins X provides automated CI/CD for
  Kubernetes with Preview Environments on Pull Requests using Cloud Native pipelines
  from Tekton. The project will take roughly 6 months to complete. Once the technical
  writer is selected, we will do an orientation to bring him up to speed. This is
  the timeline we have in mind, but we are flexible.
