summary: 'Project proposal for Google Season of Docs 2022 ðŸ“„ Project proposal Timeline
  Budget Additional information Other ideas We have put together a project proposal
  as part of our application to participate in the Google Season of Docs 2022 program.
  Jenkins X provides automated CI/CD for Kubernetes with Preview Environments on Pull
  Requests using Cloud Native pipelines from Tekton. End users of Jenkins X are unable
  to find information on how to use Jenkins X for real world use cases which includes:
  Production best practices Scanning images in Jenkins X pipelines How to make your
  app use different configuration/secrets for each environment Observability for your
  apps, logging, metrics, tracing Tests (Integration, e2e) Artifact management Multi
  cluster Integration with other tools in the cloud native sector Production best
  practices Scanning images in Jenkins X pipelines How to make your app use different
  configuration/secrets for each environment Observability for your apps, logging,
  metrics, tracing Tests (Integration, e2e) Artifact management Multi cluster Integration
  with other tools in the cloud native sector Audit the current Jenkins X documentation
  and create a friction log Use the friction log as a guide for understanding the
  gaps in the documentation Interact with the Jenkins X community to create a list
  of top use cases Create a survey Look at the github issues and slack messages Create
  a survey Look at the github issues and slack messages Work with the volunteers to
  incorporate those changes into the documentation Establish a feedback loop (the
  target customers are the end users of Jenkins X) to improve the documentation Decrease
  in the number of github issues raised by end users on documentation related to common
  real world use cases Short 1-2 minute videos on common tasks that end users of Jenkins
  X would like to perform. Must have: Experience with github Communication skills
  to work with the Jenkins X community Creating online surveys Experience with github
  Communication skills to work with the Jenkins X community Creating online surveys
  Nice to have: Basic experience with docker compose (local development scripts use
  compose) Good video editing skills. Some knowledge working with the documentation
  of other tools in the kubernetes ecosystem Basic experience with docker compose
  (local development scripts use compose) Good video editing skills. Some knowledge
  working with the documentation of other tools in the kubernetes ecosystem Ankit
  D Mohapatra Christoffer Vig MÃ¥rten Svantesson Tom Hobson The project will take roughly
  6 months to complete. Once the technical writer is selected, we will do an orientation
  to bring him up to speed. This is the timeline we have in mind, but we are flexible.
  The cost of the t-shirt was taken from here. The t-shirts are for the technical
  writer, volunteers and any member of the jenkins X community (not officially listed
  as a volunteer) who helps out by answering the technical writerâ€™s questions. Previous
  participation in Season of Docs, Google Summer of Code or others Jenkins X participated
  in the 2020 Season of docs. The maturity level matrix created by the technical writer
  is still used by the community to evaluate if Jenkins X will work for their use
  case, as well as used by the Jenkins X maintainers to plan the roadmap for improving
  Jenkins X.'
