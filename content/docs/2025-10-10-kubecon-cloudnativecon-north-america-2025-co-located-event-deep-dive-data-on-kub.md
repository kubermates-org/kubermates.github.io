  Day (DoK Day) began as a virtual event in 2021 and became an official co-located
  event for KubeCon + Cloud Native Con in 2023. Since then, it has been a staple at
  both the European and North American events, so we’re excited to bring it back for
  our community in Atlanta. Running stateful workloads like databases, streaming,
  AI/ML, and analytics on Kubernetes is no longer a fringe practice—it’s becoming
  the standard for modern infrastructure. Organizations like Etsy, Grab, and Chick-fil-A
  have demonstrated what’s possible. Our goal for DoK Day is to provide you with the
  real-world resources, best practices, and use cases you need to confidently run
  data workloads on Kubernetes and accelerate your journey. This year, we have seen
  a significant increase in content submissions focusing on AI and LLMs, reflecting
  the industry trend of Kubernetes becoming the foundation for AI infrastructure.
  Our schedule will feature several new talks on this topic, from leveraging GPUs
  to managing AI data pipelines on Kubernetes. We are also proud to have our most
  diverse group of speakers and submissions to date, representing a wide range of
  backgrounds and experiences from the community. DoK Day is for practitioners and
  decision-makers who are pushing Kubernetes beyond stateless applications. Platform
  engineers, SREs, data engineers, architects, and CTOs who want to understand how
  to run stateful workloads at scale will find immense value. Whether you’re just
  starting to explore running DoK or are already operating mission-critical workloads
  in production, you’ll walk away with practical knowledge and a stronger network
  of peers facing similar challenges. No formal prep is required, but we recommend
  attendees familiarize themselves with the Data on Kubernetes Community (DoKC) resources—such
  as our white papers, recorded talks, and Slack discussions.
