  Edge computing Infrastructure Applications Virtualization Share In our previous
  post in this series, we talked about how AI is beginning to change the way software
  is developed. In this follow-up, we focus on some of the main legal (or quasi-legal)
  issues that open source developers themselves have been raising regarding AI-assisted
  development. This isn’t a comprehensive overview of every legal issue connected
  to AI. We aren’t addressing, for example, customer concerns about compliance with
  AI regulations or liability issues relating to contracts for AI-powered products.
  Instead, we’re focusing on issues that are being actively debated inside open source
  communities. Our views on these issues reflect our commitment to responsible use
  of AI technologies and our “default to open” philosophy. We believe that collaborative
  and transparent approaches are the best ways to address these concerns constructively.
  Attribution is a core legal and cultural norm in open source. Licenses generally
  require you to preserve copyright and authorship notices, and to avoid misleading
  claims of authorship. AI-assisted development complicates this. Because AI systems
  are not considered “authors” under copyright law, there is technically no one to
  credit. But it would still be misleading for a developer to present substantial
  AI-generated output as purely their own work.'
