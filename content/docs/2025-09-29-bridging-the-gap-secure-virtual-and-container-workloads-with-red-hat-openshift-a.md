  Share While migrating virtual or containerized workloads between environments may
  seem straightforward, teams responsible for managing system uptime, policy enforcement,

  Red Hat OpenShift Virtualization combined with Palo Alto Networks VM-Series software
  firewalls helps address these complexities where they typically arise. OpenShift
  Virtualization streamlines the modernization and lifecycle management of VM-based
  workloads within a Kubernetes-native platform. VM-Series complements this by bringing
  consistent, application-aware network security to virtualized environments, helping
  teams enforce policy and maintain visibility even as infrastructure evolves. Additionally,
  Red Hat OpenShift integrated with Prisma AIRS™ enables customers to deploy AI-powered
  threat prevention for runtime network protection across containerized workloads
  running on OpenShift clusters. Many enterprises operate in hybrid environments by
  necessity, not choice. Existing virtualization investments coexist with containerized
  applications, and teams are expected to support both with equal reliability. The
  operational challenge is not only bridging these domains but doing so without fragmenting
  security policy, tooling, or visibility. Today, workloads migrate between private
  clouds, public clouds, or across datacenters and have different form factors of
  the workload including physical, virtual, and containerized. While this provides
  significant flexibility to the customers, it compounds the issue of enforcing uniform
  security posture, and migrations become moments of risk. Policy gaps, inconsistent
  segmentation, or east-west blind spots can create undetected lateral movement paths
  for threats.'
