  Encryption 4. Combine Calico and Istio Network Policies Seamlessly A Simpler, More
  Secure, More Scalable Platform Organizations are struggling with rising operational
  complexity, fragmented tools, and inconsistent security enforcement as Kubernetes
  becomes the foundation for modern application platforms. As a result of this complexity
  and fragmentation, platform teams are increasingly burdened by the need to stitch
  together separate solutions for networking, network security, and observability.
  This fragmentation also creates higher operating costs, security gaps, inefficient
  troubleshooting, and an elevated risk of outages in mission-critical environments.
  The challenge is even greater for companies running multiple Kubernetes distributions,
  as relying on each platform’s unique and often incompatible networking stack can
  lead to significant vendor lock-in and operational overhead. Tigera’s unified platform
  strategy is designed to address these challenges by providing a single solution
  that brings together all the essential Kubernetes networking and security capabilities
  enterprises need, that includes Istio Ambient Mode, delivered consistently across
  every Kubernetes distribution. Istio Ambient Mode brings sidecarless service-mesh
  functionality that includes authentication, authorization, encryption, L4/L7 traffic
  controls, and deep application-level (L7) observability directly into the unified
  Calico platform. By including Istio Ambient Mode with Calico and making it easy
  to install and manage with the Tigera Operator and including enterprise support,
  Tigera is giving customers a simpler, more scalable, and more secure way to achieve
  secure networking across their Kubernetes environments. The result is reduced operational
  strain, lower costs, and a single consistent platform for networking, network security,
  and observability across every cluster.'
