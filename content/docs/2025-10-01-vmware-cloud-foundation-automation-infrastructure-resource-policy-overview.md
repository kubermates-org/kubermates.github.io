  VCF Breakroom Chats Episode 60: Infrastructure Modernization, Health, and APIs for
  Private Cloud With the release of VMware Cloud Foundation 9.0, we introduced a number
  of new and exciting features and capabilities to help our customers deliver an agile,
  performant, and secure self-service private cloud. As part of a private cloud strategy,
  providing a way to consume the underlying infrastructure services and deliver applications
  quickly all the while managing governance is crucial. With VMware Cloud Foundation
  (VCF), a number of cloud services are available for consumption, such as VM and
  Kubernetes Cluster services, along with services for database management, continuous
  delivery pipelines, service mesh, image registry, and much much more. This blog
  is an overview of some of the core services like VM and Kubernetes services along
  with how to apply IaaS resource policies to them. Resource policies help ensure
  configurations such as cluster sizes are compliant. Security postures such as enforcing
  a baseline pod security level, and disallowing resources to be deployed, are just
  a few examples of how to use resource policies. Choice of Consumption Models With
  VCF, Organization Admins can choose how to isolate users and resources using constructs
  such as Organizations (tenants), Projects, namespaces, etc. Consumers, such as developers
  and app teams, also have choice in how they want to consume. The graphic below shows
  two primary methods: Self-Service Catalog and UI/CLI. Single Platform for Building
  and Managing Apps VMware Cloud Foundation is a single platform for building and
  managing applications and services for the entire Organization (tenants). IT teams
  can run and manage diverse workloads, including AI/ML and cloud native applications.
  Teams can use a modern interface (UI + code) to facilitate the deployment of services
  such as databases and VMs.'
