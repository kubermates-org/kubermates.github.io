  Engineer at Tetrate AI workloads are complex, and unmanaged complexity kills velocity.
  Your architecture is the key to mastering it. As generative AI (GenAI) becomes foundational
  to modern software products, developers face a chaotic new reality, juggling different
  APIs from various providers while also attempting to deploy self-hosted open-source
  models. This leads to credential sprawl, inconsistent security policies, runaway
  costs, and an infrastructure that is difficult to scale and govern. Your architecture
  doesn’t have to be this complex. Platform engineering teams need a secure, scalable
  way to serve both internal and external LLMs to their users. That’s where tools
  such as Envoy AI Gateway come in. This reference architecture outlines how to build
  a flexible GenAI platform using the open source solutions Envoy AI Gateway, KServe,
  and complementary tools. Whether you’re self-hosting models or integrating with
  model-serving services on cloud providers, such as OpenAI and Anthropic, this architecture
  enables a unified, governable interface for LLM traffic. The foundation of this
  platform is a Two-Tier Gateway Architecture: Deployed in a centralized Gateway Cluster.
  It serves as the main API traffic entry point for client applications. Its Job:
  To route traffic to external LLM providers (e.'
