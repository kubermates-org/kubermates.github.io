  projects highlighted in this post The Cloud Native Computing Foundation ( CNCF )
  has experienced remarkable growth since its inception, welcoming its first project,
  Kubernetes , on March 10, 2016. By 2025, the CNCF proudly supports over 200 active
  projects , generating thousands of meetings annually. This rapid expansion, while
  a testament to the thriving cloud native ecosystem, also presented a unique set
  of operational challenges, particularly in managing project calendars. Historically,
  CNCF staff members manually managed a central Google Calendar for all projects,
  handling requests for meeting additions, changes, and removals through a high-volume
  service desk ticketing system. For anyone who has struggled to keep even a couple
  of personal calendars synchronized, the complexity of managing over 200 project
  calendars on behalf of diverse communities is easily imaginable. This labor-intensive
  process, while functional, was not scalable and often led to bottlenecks for both
  projects and staff. The CNCF Projects team is continuously seeking innovative ways
  to enhance the project experience through automation and increased autonomy. Recognizing
  the need for a more efficient and empowering calendar solution, the team initiated
  a significant transition in June 2025. Projects are now being migrated to the new
  CNCF calendar system, a robust platform backed by the Linux Foundation’s LFX infrastructure.
  This new system introduces self-managed calendars for every project, empowering
  maintainers with direct control over their scheduling. The foundation of this new
  calendar system is the Linux Foundation Project Control Center (PCC). PCC serves
  as the single source of truth for project lifecycle information, dynamically pulling
  essential details such as project logos, calendar links, and GitHub links, and displaying
  them directly on the new calendar interface.
