summary: 'A Blueprint for DevSecOps: Accelerating Federal Agencies with IBM and Nirmata
  The Challenge: Navigating a Complex Landscape The Solution: The IBM PDE Factory
  The Power of Policy as Code A Cultural Shift: From Remediation to Creation In the
  rapidly evolving world of IT modernization, federal agencies face a unique set of
  challenges. They must navigate complex security mandates and legacy systems while
  striving for the agility and speed of modern software development. A recent webinar
  featuring experts from IBM Federal and Nirmata shed light on this very topic, offering
  a compelling vision for accelerating DevSecOps and ensuring security is a foundational
  element, not an afterthought. A poll conducted during the webinar revealed the top
  hurdles for federal agencies: a tie between manual processes and legacy systems
  and security and compliance mandates. This perfectly illustrates the central conflict.
  How do you move fast when everything is a manual, security-audited process? As Mark
  Wells, DevSecOps and IT Automation Practice Lead for IBM Federal, explained, this
  was the exact problem that led to the creation of the IBM PTE Factory. Born from
  the chaos of DevOps engineers “running around like chickens with their heads cut
  off,” the factory was designed to automate the deployment of infrastructure and
  development environments. The IBM PDE Factory is an asset—a platform and product
  engineering tool designed to deliver core services and support for software engineering.
  It’s built around a “start left” philosophy, meaning security is integrated from
  the very beginning of the process, not “shifted left” later. The factory’s core
  is a series of “builders” that automate critical tasks: Resource Builder: Ensures
  all container images and resources are certified and attested to, with near-zero
  vulnerabilities, before they are ever used. Platform Builder: Automates the creation
  of the entire cloud architecture. Security Builder: Deploys pre-configured bundles
  of security policies.'
