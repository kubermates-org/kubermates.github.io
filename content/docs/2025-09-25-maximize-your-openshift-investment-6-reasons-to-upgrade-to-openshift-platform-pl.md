  So why upgrade to Red Hat OpenShift Platform Plus ? The answer depends on where
  you are—and where you’re going. Maybe you started with a single team working on
  one project. But suddenly that team turned into 10 and now you’re drowning in security
  checks, management tools, and developer requests. If you’re juggling apps across
  a dozen environments and wondering, “How do I keep all of this secure and manageable—and
  keep my developers happy?,” OpenShift Platform Plus can help. With OpenShift Platform
  Plus, you gain an agile application environment with enhanced security and management
  tools, built to boost your efficiency and simplify your operations. And, you can
  upgrade with ease—no reinstalls needed. Let’s dive into how OpenShift Platform Plus
  can help your business. Built-in security that works from development to deployment
  Security and compliance are challenging for every organization, especially when
  you’re trying to keep systems consistent across different environments. If you feel
  like every time you push a new app into production, a whole new audit process slows
  everything down, you’re not alone. OpenShift Platform Plus gives you integrated
  security with Red Hat Advanced Cluster Security for Kubernetes. It scans everything
  from the moment you build to when it’s running live.'
