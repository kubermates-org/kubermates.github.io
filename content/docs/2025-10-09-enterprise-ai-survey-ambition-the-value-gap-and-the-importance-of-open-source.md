  organizations are primed for widespread AI adoption, and see enterprise open source
  as an important success factor; however, their ability to scale is challenged by
  skills gaps, high costs and shadow AI. That’s the headline finding of our latest
  survey of over 900 IT leaders and AI engineers in nine countries 1. According to
  the survey AI is a core strategic priority for 72% 2 of organizations in Europe,
  the Middle East, and Africa, and they have plans to increase their AI investments
  by an average of 32% by 2026 3. The focus on AI is clear, yet the data also reveals
  a stark gap between ambition and reality: only 7% of organisations report “driving
  customer value” at scale from their AI investments today 4. This is a crucial challenge
  for leaders who need to translate significant investment into tangible business
  outcomes. So what is preventing organisations moving from small-scale pilots to
  enterprise-wide value? Tackling the barriers to scale AI Our survey data outlines
  the extent of the talent shortage faced, with 70% of respondents agreeing there
  is an urgent AI skills gap 3. The most significant gaps cited by those respondents
  are in the practical application of AI, such as connecting AI to enterprise data
  (49%), and making efficient use of AI capabilities (48%). Nearly as many (47%) report
  difficulty educating the business to use AI effectively, which complicates organisation-wide
  adoption. As the role of AI in the workplace is established, another layer of complexity
  emerges. ‘Shadow AI’, the use of unsanctioned AI tools by employees, is becoming
  a significant challenge to effective governance and scalable adoption. The vast
  majority of responding EMEA organisations (91% 5 ) admit their organisation is experiencing
  a shadow AI problem. This should serve as a wake-up call: AI is being adopted with
  or without IT teams’ authorisation.'
