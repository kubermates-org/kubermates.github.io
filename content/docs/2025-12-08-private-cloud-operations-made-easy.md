  In his new For Dummies guide, Lawrence C. Miller explains how to operate VMware
  Cloud Foundation (VCF) , the platform that provides public cloud scale and private
  cloud control. This easy-to-understand resource covers private cloud operations
  and explains how to: Slash total cost of ownership (TCO) – Use capacity planning
  with chargeback/showback to optimize costs. Streamline operations – Unify fleet
  management with centralized licensing, certificate, and password management to improve
  efficiency. Boost resilience – Leverage AI and machine learning analytics for intelligent
  troubleshooting, leading to faster resolution and improved productivity. Accelerate
  modernization – Enable scalability and growth by seamlessly moving vSphere workloads
  where needed without the cost of redesigning applications or networks. Don’t let
  unexpected costs of public cloud sprawl dictate your IT initiatives. Learn how to
  modernize your vSphere infrastructure with full-stack visibility using VMware Cloud
  Foundation. Read the Private Cloud Operations For Dummies Guide.'
