summary: 'This story is becoming more and more common in the Kubernetes world. What
  starts as a manageable cluster or two can quickly balloon into a sprawling, multi-cluster
  architecture spanning public clouds, private data centers, or a bit of both. And
  with that growth comes a whole new set of headaches. How do you keep tabs on compliance
  across wildly different configurations? When a service goes down across multiple
  clusters, how do you pinpoint the cause amidst the chaos? And what about those hard-to-diagnose
  latency issues that seem to crop up between regions? The truth is, achieving secure
  and scalable multi-cluster Kubernetes isn’t about throwing more tools at the problem.
  It’s about having the right tools and adopting the right best practices. This is
  where a solution like Calico Cluster Mesh shines, offering those essential capabilities
  for a seamless multi-cluster experience without the complexity or overhead that
  you expect with traditional service meshes. So, why are so many organizations finding
  themselves in this multi-cluster maze? Often, it’s driven by solid business reasons:
  While these motivations are sound, the challenges that emerge in these multi-cloud
  environments are remarkably consistent: This is where Calico Cluster Mesh comes
  into play. It provides seamless connectivity between clusters deployed across different
  regions, VPCs, or VNETs, allowing you to interact with services as if they were
  local. Calico handles the networking with a VXLAN overlay, which means less reliance
  on cloud vendor-specific networking and fewer unnecessary network hops. Securing
  Kubernetes isn’t just about drawing lines around your network. It’s about truly
  understanding how your workloads interact and then enforcing granular policies,
  even across distributed clusters. A consistent and scalable policy model is absolutely
  vital in multi-cluster deployments.'
