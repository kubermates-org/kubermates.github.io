summary: 'The Multi-Cluster Challenge: When Complexity Takes Over Calico’s Approach:
  Seamless Security, Streamlined Operations, and Crystal-Clear Visibility Enhanced
  Security Across the Board Intelligent Traffic Management: North/South and East/West
  Unified Observability: Seeing is Securing The Outcome: A Robust and Efficient Kubernetes
  Infrastructure This story is becoming more and more common in the Kubernetes world.
  What starts as a manageable cluster or two can quickly balloon into a sprawling,
  multi-cluster architecture spanning public clouds, private data centers, or a bit
  of both. And with that growth comes a whole new set of headaches. How do you keep
  tabs on compliance across wildly different configurations? When a service goes down
  across multiple clusters, how do you pinpoint the cause amidst the chaos? And what
  about those hard-to-diagnose latency issues that seem to crop up between regions?
  The truth is, achieving secure and scalable multi-cluster Kubernetes isn’t about
  throwing more tools at the problem. It’s about having the right tools and adopting
  the right best practices. This is where a solution like Calico Cluster Mesh shines,
  offering those essential capabilities for a seamless multi-cluster experience without
  the complexity or overhead that you expect with traditional service meshes. So,
  why are so many organizations finding themselves in this multi-cluster maze? Often,
  it’s driven by solid business reasons: High Availability and Disaster Recovery:
  Spreading workloads across multiple regions or clusters means that if one goes down,
  your users shouldn’t notice. Performance Optimization: Shifting compute resources
  to take advantage of lower pricing or bringing processing closer to the data at
  the edge can make a big difference. Regulatory and Compliance Requirements: Sometimes,
  data simply has to reside in specific geographies. Hybrid Cloud Strategies: The
  reality is, not everything can or should move to the cloud. A hybrid approach allows
  organizations to keep sensitive or legacy systems on-premises while still leveraging
  the flexibility and scalability of public cloud. While these motivations are sound,
  the challenges that emerge in these multi-cloud environments are remarkably consistent:
  Inter-cluster communication is a beast.'
