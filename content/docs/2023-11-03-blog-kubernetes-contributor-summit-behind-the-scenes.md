summary: 'Kubernetes Contributor Summit: Behind-the-scenes The Contributor Summit
  What makes it special Organizing the Summit A look ahead Every year, just before
  the official start of KubeCon+CloudNativeCon, there’s a special event that has a
  very special place in the hearts of those organizing and participating in it: the
  Kubernetes Contributor Summit. To find out why, and to provide a behind-the-scenes
  perspective, we interview Noah Abrahams, whom amongst other roles was the co-lead
  for the Kubernetes Contributor Summit in 2023. Frederico Muñoz (FSM) : Hello Noah,
  and welcome. Could you start by introducing yourself and telling us how you got
  involved in Kubernetes? Noah Abrahams (NA) : I’ve been in this space for quite a
  while. I got started in IT in the mid 90’s, and I’ve been working in the “Cloud”
  space for about 15 years. It was, frankly, through a combination of sheer luck (being
  in the right place at the right time) and having good mentors to pull me into those
  places (thanks, Tim!), that I ended up at a startup called Apprenda in 2016. While
  I was there, they pivoted into Kubernetes, and it was the best thing that could
  have happened to my career. It was around v1.2 and someone asked me if I could give
  a presentation on Kubernetes concepts at “my local meetup” in Las Vegas. The meetup
  didn’t exist yet, so I created it, and got involved in the wider community. One
  thing led to another, and soon I was involved in ContribEx, joined the release team,
  was doing booth duty for the CNCF, became an ambassador, and here we are today.
  FM : Before leading the organisation of the KCSEU 2023, how many other Contributor
  Summits were you a part of? NA : I was involved in four or five before taking the
  lead. If I’m recalling correctly, I attended the summit in Copenhagen, then sometime
  in 2018 I joined the wrong meeting, because the summit staff meeting was listed
  on the ContribEx calendar.'
