  \ 29, 2025 3 min read Hacktoberfest registrations are live, and weâ\x80\x99re just\
  \ a few days away from kicking off the month-long celebration of open source. Every\
  \ October, developers from all over the world come together to contribute their\
  \ skills, big and small, to open-source projects. Code is the most common way people\
  \ participate, but thatâ\x80\x99s not the only way you can help. Open source thrives\
  \ on more than just commits. It needs documentation, testing, design, writing, and\
  \ so much more. Before we get into the how, letâ\x80\x99s cover the basics. First,\
  \ the rules of Hacktoberfest: Register anytime before October 31. Contribute to\
  \ projects on GitHub or GitLab that have the hacktoberfest topic. hacktoberfest\
  \ Submit at least 6 high-quality pull/merge requests between October 1 and October\
  \ 31. These need to be accepted by project maintainers to count. Rewards: Everyone\
  \ who signs up and gets at least one PR merged, gets a digital badge from Holopin\
  \ (you can get up to 4 badges). If youâ\x80\x99re among the first 10,000 people\
  \ to complete 6 merged PRs/MRs, youâ\x80\x99ll also get a limited edition Hactoberfest\
  \ 2025 t-shirt."
