summary: 'What if you could just ask: >>> how''s my nginx app doing? …and your terminal
  figured out the rest? Thanks to kubectl-ai , Kubernetes can now understand natural
  language. You type what you want in plain English, and it responds by executing
  real, context-aware kubectl commands — without needing to memorize flags, write
  YAML, or guess namespaces. Let’s explore how this works in action. Before you can
  chat with your cluster, make sure you have the basics in place: The fastest way
  (Linux & macOS): Skip the manual steps and install in one line: curl -sSL https://raw.
  githubusercontent. com/GoogleCloudPlatform/kubectl-ai/main/install. sh | bash You’ll
  be ready to talk to your cluster in under a minute. Prefer to do it yourself? Manual
  install (Linux, macOS, Windows): Already a kubectl power user? Install with Krew
  (Linux/macOS/Windows): If you use Krew (the plugin manager for kubectl), installation
  is a breeze: Now, just invoke it as a kubectl plugin: No matter which method you
  choose, you’ll be ready to type natural language commands and let kubectl-ai handle
  the rest. No more memorizing flags, no more YAML wrangling—just pure, conversational
  Kubernetes. Ready to see kubectl-ai in action? Now that setup is out of the way,
  it’s time to experience the magic of conversational Kubernetes firsthand. Let’s
  dive in: Instead of juggling flags and memorizing resource names, just type your
  question—kubectl-ai will handle the rest. Note: The following examples are run on
  a Windows system using the OpenAI GPT-4o model, but kubectl-ai works just as smoothly
  across platforms and with other LLM providers.'
