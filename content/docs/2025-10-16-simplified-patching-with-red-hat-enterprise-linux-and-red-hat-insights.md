  Edge computing Infrastructure Applications Virtualization Share The most common
  task facing system administrators is patching infrastructure. It''s time consuming,
  it requires coordination with application teams and stakeholders, and it often must
  happen in segments over time. These complications make it difficult to maintain
  environmental consistency, which in turn can lead to instability, performance issues,
  and more time spent by operations staff. Using Red Hat Insights content templates
  to patch Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) helps limit the complexity of these activities
  while also increasing consistency across an IT estate. Using Red Hat Insights, the
  process is simplified and more prescriptive: Define the software you want in your
  environment, instruct your Red Hat Insights-registered systems to pull updates from
  that set of software, and patch. It doesn''t matter whether you patch your RHEL
  system today or three weeks from now, you can have greater confidence that the updates
  installed in your environment are the ones you want, and nothing more. For each
  subsequent patch cycle, you update your definition, which automatically instructs
  your systems to pull updates from this new set of updates, and you patch. In Red
  Hat Insights, this set of software is called a content template. You can create
  a content template on the Hybrid Cloud Console content template page. A content
  template is defined by a date and a set of package repositories, which can include
  those provided by Red Hat, partners, or custom repositories created by you. Any
  system you associate with that content template is automatically limited to the
  set of updates from those repositories on the date you''ve selected. You can then
  update your systems using the schedule and method of your choosing, knowing that
  the end result will be systems with a more predictable and consistent set of software
  installed.'
