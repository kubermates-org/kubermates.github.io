  built something just for you. The high-level guide to Red Hat OpenShift Virtualization
  as a VMware admin learning path is designed to bridge the learning gap many face
  when moving from traditional virtualization solutions to Kubernetes workflows. This
  blog provides a glimpse into what''s included in the path so you can take on OpenShift
  Virtualization with confidence. This learning path enables VMware experts to quickly
  become productive with OpenShift Virtualization by providing direct, chapter-based
  translations of key technical concepts. With the OpenShift Virtualization learning
  path, VM admins can: Translate familiar VMware concepts into OpenShift paradigms.
  Through storage, networking, compute, observability, and VM component chapters,
  the path offers direct “translations” of how functions work in OpenShift Virtualization.
  Learn fast with manageable chapters. Chapters focus on key themes, including storage,
  networking, compute, observability, and VM components, making up 30 minutes of content
  in total. Understand differences and similarities. Some tasks map directly; some
  require new ways of thinking. The path helps you understand when to take advantage
  of what you know and when to explore new concepts. Reduce risk in transition.'
