  hybrid cloud Security Edge computing Infrastructure Applications Virtualization
  Share With cyberattacks on the rise, increasing software supply chain visibility
  is crucial for organizations to proactively identify and mitigate vulnerabilities
  within their applications and infrastructure. However, handling diverse security
  data sources such as software bill of materials (SBOMs), critical vulnerabilities
  and exploits (CVEs), and vendor advisories remains a major challenge due to inconsistent
  formats, varying levels of detail, and the lack of standardized integration points.
  Addressing this challenge requires not only better tools, but also open collaboration
  across the entire ecosystem, demanding transparency and trust. In an effort to create
  a more unified and scalable solution for managing security metadata, Red Hat is
  proud to contribute Trustify to the Graph for Understanding Artifact Composition
  (GUAC), an Open Source Security Foundation (OpenSSF) incubating project. This contribution
  reflects Red Hat’s belief that transparent, upstream-first innovation is essential
  to building security solutions that are more scalable, interoperable, and community-driven.
  Under the OpenSSF umbrella, end-users will be able to contribute and collaborate
  to Trustify, helping to grow the project adoption and mature the technology. Trustify
  is an open source project, developed by Red Hat, that provides a high-performance,
  searchable backend for software supply chain metadata. It supports SBOM and advisory
  formats such as SPDX, CycloneDX, and OSV, and is designed for integration into modern
  continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) workflows. The GUAC open
  source project aggregates and connects software security metadata into a unified
  graph. It enables developers and security teams to answer complex questions about
  software provenance, vulnerability impact, and supply chain integrity at scale.
  Both Trustify and GUAC are designed to tackle the overwhelming challenge of managing
  vast amounts of software security data that can lead to unmanageable vulnerability
  handling for security engineers (also known as “alert fatigue”). While Trustify
  focuses on providing a single, searchable database for SBOMs, CVEs and advisories,
  GUAC's strength lies in its ability to normalize data from multiple sources into
  a rich graph database, providing deeper insights and actionable intelligence.
