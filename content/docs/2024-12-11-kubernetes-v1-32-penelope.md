summary: 'Editors: Matteo Bianchi, Edith Puclla, William Rizzo, Ryota Sawada, Rashan
  Smith Announcing the release of Kubernetes v1. 32: Penelope! In line with previous
  releases, the release of Kubernetes v1. 32 introduces new stable, beta, and alpha
  features. The consistent delivery of high-quality releases underscores the strength
  of our development cycle and the vibrant support from our community. This release
  consists of 44 enhancements in total. Of those enhancements, 13 have graduated to
  Stable, 12 are entering Beta, and 19 have entered in Alpha. The Kubernetes v1. 32
  Release Theme is "Penelope". If Kubernetes is Ancient Greek for "pilot", in this
  release we start from that origin and reflect on the last 10 years of Kubernetes
  and our accomplishments: each release cycle is a journey, and just like Penelope,
  in "The Odyssey", weaved for 10 years -- each night removing parts of what she had
  done during the day -- so does each release add new features and removes others,
  albeit here with a much clearer purpose of constantly improving Kubernetes. With
  v1. 32 being the last release in the year Kubernetes marks its first decade anniversary,
  we wanted to honour all of those that have been part of the global Kubernetes crew
  that roams the cloud-native seas through perils and challanges: may we continue
  to weave the future of Kubernetes together. In this release, like the previous one,
  the Kubernetes project continues proposing a number of enhancements to the Dynamic
  Resource Allocation (DRA), a key component of the Kubernetes resource management
  system.'
