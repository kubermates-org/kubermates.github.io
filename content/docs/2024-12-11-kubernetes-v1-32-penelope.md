  Announcing the release of Kubernetes v1.32: Penelope! In line with previous releases,
  the release of Kubernetes v1.32 introduces new stable, beta, and alpha features.
  The consistent delivery of high-quality releases underscores the strength of our
  development cycle and the vibrant support from our community. This release consists
  of 44 enhancements in total. Of those enhancements, 13 have graduated to Stable,
  12 are entering Beta, and 19 have entered in Alpha. The Kubernetes v1.32 Release
  Theme is "Penelope". If Kubernetes is Ancient Greek for "pilot", in this release
  we start from that origin and reflect on the last 10 years of Kubernetes and our
  accomplishments: each release cycle is a journey, and just like Penelope, in "The
  Odyssey", weaved for 10 years -- each night removing parts of what she had done
  during the day -- so does each release add new features and removes others, albeit
  here with a much clearer purpose of constantly improving Kubernetes. With v1.32
  being the last release in the year Kubernetes marks its first decade anniversary,
  we wanted to honour all of those that have been part of the global Kubernetes crew
  that roams the cloud-native seas through perils and challanges: may we continue
  to weave the future of Kubernetes together. In this release, like the previous one,
  the Kubernetes project continues proposing a number of enhancements to the Dynamic
  Resource Allocation (DRA), a key component of the Kubernetes resource management
  system. These enhancements aim to improve the flexibility and efficiency of resource
  allocation for workloads that require specialized hardware, such as GPUs, FPGAs
  and network adapters. These features are particularly useful for use-cases such
  as machine learning or high-performance computing applications. The core part enabling
  DRA Structured parameter support got promoted to beta. SIG Node has the following
  highlights that go beyond KEPs: The systemd watchdog capability is now used to restart
  the kubelet when its health check fails, while also limiting the maximum number
  of restarts within a given time period.'
