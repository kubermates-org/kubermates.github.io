summary: 'Running Kyverno is essential for enforcing Kubernetes governance and security
  policies. But is your Kyverno setup secure, scalable, and resilient? With the latest
  enhancement in Nirmata Control Hub , you no longer have to guess. We’re excited
  to introduce the Kyverno Health Check – a new capability that provides a clear,
  actionable view of Kyverno’s configuration in your clusters. Whether you’re a platform
  engineer managing dozens of clusters or a security lead enforcing policy compliance,
  this feature helps to ensure that Kyverno is running optimally at all times. Kyverno
  by Nirmata enforces critical security, compliance, and operational policies in Kubernetes.
  But like any controller, its effectiveness depends on its own configuration and
  health. A misconfigured or unhealthy Kyverno deployment can : Kyverno Health Check
  ensures none of this happens by continuously and vigilantly evaluating your deployments
  for best practices and known risks. The new Kyverno Health Check feature in Nirmata
  Control Hub evaluates Kyverno deployments based on four critical categories: Each
  category is scored and flagged as: These results are aggregated into a Kyverno Health
  Grade (A to F), allowing you to view the overall state of Kyverno at a glance and
  drill down to address the areas that matter most. In many clusters, Kyverno components
  may restart frequently or be terminated due to out-of-memory (OOM) conditions. These
  issues often go unnoticed until policy failures occur. That’s a risk. Nirmata Control
  Hub detects this and gives you: You or your team can apply the fix, rescan the cluster,
  and watch your health grade improve.'
