  What’s New: Kyverno Health Check Real Example: NetworkPolicy for Kyverno Getting
  Started Why Kyverno Health Check Matters Running Kyverno is essential for enforcing
  Kubernetes governance and security policies. But is your Kyverno setup secure, scalable,
  and resilient? With the latest enhancement in Nirmata Control Hub , you no longer
  have to guess. We’re excited to introduce the Kyverno Health Check – a new capability
  that provides a clear, actionable view of Kyverno’s configuration in your clusters.
  Whether you’re a platform engineer managing dozens of clusters or a security lead
  enforcing policy compliance, this feature helps to ensure that Kyverno is running
  optimally at all times. Kyverno by Nirmata enforces critical security, compliance,
  and operational policies in Kubernetes. But like any controller, its effectiveness
  depends on its own configuration and health. A misconfigured or unhealthy Kyverno
  deployment can : Allow lateral network traffic to Kyverno pods. Fail under load
  due to insufficient resource settings Go unnoticed during outages due to missing
  observability. Or worse, be vulnerable to privilege escalation or unauthorized cluster-admin
  bindings Kyverno Health Check ensures none of this happens by continuously and vigilantly
  evaluating your deployments for best practices and known risks. The new Kyverno
  Health Check feature in Nirmata Control Hub evaluates Kyverno deployments based
  on four critical categories: Security Detects wildcard permissions, cluster-admin
  bindings, and missing NetworkPolicies Detects wildcard permissions, cluster-admin
  bindings, and missing NetworkPolicies Availability Checks for resource configurations,
  pod disruption budgets, and runtime stability of Kyverno. Checks for resource configurations,
  pod disruption budgets, and runtime stability of Kyverno.'
