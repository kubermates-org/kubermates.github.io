  to Cloud Hero - Building a Multi-Tenant Cloud with VCF 9.0 We’re thrilled to announce
  the latest release of VMware Cloud Foundation (VCF), marking a pivotal moment for
  platform engineers who have been seeking a unified, enterprise-grade solution for
  managing Kubernetes (K8s) infrastructure at scale. This groundbreaking release introduces
  native K8s multi-cluster management capabilities in VCF accessed through the VCF
  Automation consumption experience. It’s specifically designed to address the complex
  challenges that platform engineers face when orchestrating K8s workloads across
  distributed environments. This capability provides platform engineers with control
  over their K8s environments, while maintaining the simplicity and operational consistency
  they need. Its new K8s multi-cluster management capabilities complement built-in
  private cloud services (VM, vSphere Kubernetes Service (VKS) (K8s runtime), Network,
  Volume, VM Image) that allow engineers to provision VMs and VKS clusters as K8s
  objects using K8s manifests. Engineers can use the cloud services and Infrastructure
  as Code to create version-controlled blueprints (e. g. , for provisioning VKS clusters
  and deploying applications on them) publishable to a self-service catalog for developers.
  Together the new native K8s multi-cluster management and cloud services allow organizations
  to run their entire application portfolio and manage the underlying K8s infrastructure
  on a single, streamlined platform. Platform engineers face an increasingly complex
  landscape managing K8s infrastructure due to the exponential growth of containerized
  applications. Traditional approaches can’t accommodate the operational challenges
  of modern K8s deployments, which often involve numerous clusters and multiple software
  elements across various environments. This complexity, compounded by K8s dynamic
  nature, makes maintaining visibility difficult.'
