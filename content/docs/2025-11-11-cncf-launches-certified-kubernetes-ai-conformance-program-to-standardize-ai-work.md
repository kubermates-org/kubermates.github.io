summary: Supporting Quotes New initiative targets cloud native AI portability and
  reliability across environments Key Highlights CNCF and the Kubernetes open source
  community are launching the Certified Kubernetes AI Conformance Program to create
  open, community-defined standards for running AI workloads on Kubernetes. As organizations
  increasingly move AI workloads into production, they need consistent and interoperable
  infrastructure. This initiative helps reduce fragmentation and ensures reliability
  across environments. Platform vendors, infrastructure teams, enterprise AI practitioners,
  and open source contributors in Kubernetes and across the cloud native ecosystem
  need a common foundation for seeking interoperable and production-ready AI deployments.
  The program is now available and being developed in the open to encourage broader
  participation. KUBECON + CLOUDNATIVECON NORTH AMERICA, ATLANTA — Nov. 11, 2025 —
  The Cloud Native Computing Foundation® (CNCF®), which builds sustainable ecosystems
  for cloud native software, today announced the launch of the Certified Kubernetes
  AI Conformance Program at KubeCon + CloudNativeCon North America. The new program
  introduces a community-led effort to define and validate standards for running artificial
  intelligence (AI) workloads reliably and consistently on Kubernetes. ] The program
  outlines a minimum set of capabilities and configurations required to run widely
  used AI and machine learning frameworks on Kubernetes. The initiative seeks to give
  enterprises confidence in deploying AI on Kubernetes while providing vendors a common
  baseline for compatibility. Announced in its beta phase at KubeCon + CloudNativeCon
  Japan in June, the Kubernetes AI Conformance Program has successfully certified
  its initial participants with a v1.0 release and have started to work on a roadmap
  for a v2.0 release next year. The growing use of Kubernetes for AI workloads highlights
  the importance of common standards.
