summary: '2025 Kubernetes security: Stable graduates The future is now: What to expect
  in 2026 Conclusion Posted on December 15, 2025 by Matteo Bisi, DevSecOps Team Leader,
  ReeVo Cloud & Cyber Security CNCF projects highlighted in this post It’s time to
  recap the key Kubernetes security highlights from 2025 and outline features likely
  to graduate to stable in early 2026. From a DevSecOps perspective, 2025 brought
  several meaningful security improvements that directly influenced day-2 operations
  and production hardening efforts. With Kubernetes v1.35 scheduled for release on
  December 17, now is an ideal moment to review the past year’s progress and prepare
  for what’s ahead. 2025 marked important progress in Kubernetes security, with key
  features graduating to stable status between versions 1.32 and 1.35. These advancements
  enhance authentication, authorization, workload isolation, and overall hardening
  for production cloud-native environments. Here are the most impactful stable graduates
  from 2025: Looking at the alpha and beta features in Kubernetes 1.35 gives us a
  clear indication of what’s likely to graduate to stable in 2026. These are the advancements
  that will further solidify Kubernetes as a secure platform: User namespaces continue
  to progress, reaching beta and on-by-default status in recent releases—an important
  hardening capability for improving workload isolation. Looking ahead, advancements
  in secrets management such as Pod certificates for mTLS (beta in v1.35, KEP-4317)
  and robust image pull authorization (beta, KEP-2535) are poised to strengthen credential
  handling and workload identity across Kubernetes environments. Tracking the alpha-to-stable
  lifecycle remains a helpful practice for DevSecOps teams. Evaluating emerging features
  in pre-production environments can support informed adoption and help organizations
  stay ahead of evolving security needs. Share.'
