  the sessions Virtual participation Planning your week AWS re:Invent 2025 is back
  in Las Vegas from December 1-5 with the most comprehensive Kubernetes programming
  we’ve ever assembled. This year’s event features 48 dedicated sessions covering
  the full spectrum of cloud-native technologies and variety of use cases ranging
  from foundational cluster management to advanced AI/ML workload orchestration and
  deployment on Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (Amazon EKS). Amazon EKS and Kubernetes
  sessions are part of the Containers and Serverless (CNS) track this year, featuring
  the latest innovations that help customers build, run, and scale production-ready
  Kubernetes applications easily across any environment. The Amazon EKS and Amazon
  Elastic Container Registry (Amazon ECR) teams have curated an extensive catalog
  of track sessions that address all aspects of the real challenges teams face when
  running Kubernetes in production. From automation capabilities that reduce operational
  burden to architectural patterns for AI workloads and strategies for optimizing
  performance and costs, these sessions deliver practical guidance you can apply immediately
  to your Kubernetes environments. Be sure not to miss Amazon EKS Auto Mode which
  fully automates cluster management for compute, storage, and networking on AWS with
  a single click and Amazon EKS Hybrid Nodes which extends Kubernetes management to
  on-premises and edge environments for unified operations across distributed infrastructure.
  This year we also have a special session focused on the engineering that powers
  the scale of Amazon EKS to support ultra-scale clusters of up to 100K nodes and
  enable cutting-edge AI-powered developer experiences. These include Model Context
  Protocol (MCP) integration with Amazon EKS for context-aware Kubernetes workflows
  and support for deploying sophisticated multi-agent AI systems with secure agent-to-agent
  communication. With these innovations, customers from small startups to sophisticated
  enterprises have everything they need to get started with and run production-grade
  Kubernetes applications at scale on AWS. Whether you’re evaluating Kubernetes for
  the first time or architecting multi-region platforms, you’ll find sessions tailored
  to your needs. For a detailed explanation of the different session formats, check
  out the event page. Don’t miss our key breakout sessions featuring new launches
  and innovations: CNS205: The future of Kubernetes on AWS , featuring the strategic
  direction for Kubernetes on AWS and key innovations for running Kubernetes across
  cloud, on-premises, and edge.'
