  an increasingly complex technology landscape, digital sovereignty has moved from
  a theoretical concept to an urgent strategic imperative for European organizations
  and governments. Recent global events—from supply chain disruptions to geopolitical
  conflicts—have underscored the critical need for greater control over their technology.
  Digital sovereignty is a strategic effort for organizations to build greater resilience,
  choice and confidence into IT environments. This isn’t a move towards isolation,
  with true sovereignty requiring more than just local data centers. Businesses are
  re-evaluating their provider dependencies and are increasingly looking for a flexible
  approach that allows them to define their own digital destiny through a collaborative
  and open ecosystem of partners. While data residency is crucial, it''s just one
  part of a larger, more complex picture. An effective sovereign cloud solution is
  built on four interconnected pillars: Assurance Sovereignty: Verifying that processes
  and security standards are met, and verifying that platforms are built to the required
  standards and certified for regulated industries like banking and government. Operational
  Sovereignty: Maintaining control over system management, monitoring, and who deploys
  and maintains the systems. Data Sovereignty: Having control over where data is stored
  and processed, and maintaining a high level of protection from extra-territorial
  influences. Technical Sovereignty: Exerting full control of IT environments by using
  open standards and technology to prevent dependencies on specific providers. An
  open source approach is fundamental to a sovereignty strategy because it provides
  a transparent foundation where customers can inspect and trust the underlying technology.
  However, technology alone isn''t enough; a strong partner ecosystem—particularly
  in Europe—is essential to act as a multiplier, helping organizations to meet their
  sovereignty goals.'
