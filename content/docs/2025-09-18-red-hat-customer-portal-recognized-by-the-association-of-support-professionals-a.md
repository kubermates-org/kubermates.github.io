  has announced the Red Hat Customer Portal as one of the winners of the Best Support
  Websites of 2025. This year''s winning entry highlighted several key innovations
  that continue to advance Red Hat’s customer experience, including: Ask Red Hat ,
  a conversational, AI-based generative search experience. Red Hat Offline Knowledge
  Portal (RHOKP), a new product that provides Red Hat knowledge and support documentation
  to customers in air-gap or disconnected environments. Product Compliance Experience,
  a searchable source for all product compliance records. In addition to the main
  award, Red Hat also received a special award for "Excellence in Extending Support
  to Offline Environments" for Red Hat Offline Knowledge Portal , a self-contained
  instance of Red Hat’s extensive knowledge content, enabling air-gapped, secure,
  and disconnected teams to proactively troubleshoot issues and maintain compliance
  without relying on external network access. This "pocket library" of knowledge can
  be deployed on-premise or on customer workstations, allowing users to access critical
  information and maintain their systems without needing an internet connection. The
  unique recognition from ASP highlights the value and capabilities of Red Hat Offline
  Knowledge Portal, a solution designed to bring Red Hat''s expert knowledge and support
  documentation to customers in disconnected or air-gapped environments. The accolade
  recognizes Red Hat Offline Knowledge Portal as a revolutionary product that solves
  a critical challenge for customers operating in a variety of industries, from military
  and government to remote operations and secure on-premise data centers, where internet
  connectivity is limited or prohibited. Red Hat Offline Knowledge Portal ensures
  that these customers have immediate, local access to the latest security updates,
  technical articles, and comprehensive product documentation. "The Red Hat Offline
  Knowledge Portal was born from a critical need to provide our customers with a seamless
  support experience and full subscription value no matter their operating environment,"
  said Mark Shoger, Senior Manager and product sponsor. "This special award from the
  ASP is a powerful validation of our commitment to innovation and to meeting our
  customers wherever they are. Red Hat Offline Knowledge Portal is an essential tool
  that ensures our customers can maintain, manage, and secure their Red Hat solutions
  even when disconnected from the internet.'
