  is available in our official documentation , but this blog post will answer both
  of the questions from the beginning of this article. Before we dive into details,
  let''s quickly cover what the user preferences file looks like and where to place
  it. By default, kubectl will look for kuberc file in your default kubeconfig directory,
  which is $HOME/. kube. Alternatively, you can specify this location using --kuberc
  option or the KUBERC environment variable. kubectl kuberc $HOME/. kube --kuberc
  KUBERC Just like every Kubernetes manifest, kuberc file will start with an apiVersion
  and kind : kuberc apiVersion kind apiVersion : kubectl. config. k8s. io/v1beta1
  kind : Preference # the user preferences will follow here apiVersion : kubectl.'
