summary: 'The 2024 Steering Committee Election is now complete. The Kubernetes Steering
  Committee consists of 7 seats, 3 of which were up for election in 2024. Incoming
  committee members serve a term of 2 years, and all members are elected by the Kubernetes
  Community. This community body is significant since it oversees the governance of
  the entire Kubernetes project. With that great power comes great responsibility.

  to everyone who voted in the election; your participation helps support the community’s
  continued health and success. Congratulations to the elected committee members whose
  two year terms begin immediately (listed in alphabetical order by GitHub handle):

  election. This governing body, like all of Kubernetes, is open to all. You can follow
  along with Steering Committee meeting notes and weigh in by filing an issue or creating
  a PR against their repo.'
