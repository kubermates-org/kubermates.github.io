summary: Not every security alert is a threat, but the right combination can bring
  down your cloud native and containerized applications. Security incidents rarely
  happen because of a single weak point. Instead, they stem from toxic combinations.
  A misconfigured workload might seem harmless on its own, but add exposed credentials
  and an unpatched vulnerability, and attackers have a direct path to exploitation.
  Traditional vulnerability scanners surface thousands of issues, yet many tools treat
  vulnerabilities, misconfigurations, malware, and exposed credentials as isolated
  problems rather than recognizing how they can combine to create real attack scenarios
  Without understanding the full attack surface and how risks interact, security teams
  end up chasing alerts instead of preventing breaches. Instead of drowning in alerts,
  you need context, a way to connect security findings across the entire cloud native
  application lifecycle. Aqua provides that visibility, correlating risks from the
  first line of code to runtime so security teams can focus on what is actually exploitable,
  not just what is flagged. But risk prioritization is not just about what exists,
  it is about what an attacker can actually access and exploit. A vulnerability might
  seem critical, but is it isolated in a test environment, restricted within an internal
  network, or exposed in a production system accessible from the internet? For example,
  a banking application with an unpatched critical vulnerability might seem like an
  urgent issue, but if it is running in a segmented test environment, the risk is
  far lower than if the same vulnerability exists in a publicly accessible production
  system. Aqua assesses network exposure, identifying whether a CVE is just a theoretical
  risk or if it is publicly accessible and exploitable. By linking misconfigurations,
  exposed credentials, and network exposure with known vulnerabilities, Aqua surfaces
  toxic combinations that create real world attack paths. Aqua also connects these
  risks across hybrid and multi-cloud environments, ensuring teams have a comprehensive
  view of their attack surface, no matter where workloads are running.
