  Virtualization Share Sovereignty concerns are the greatest barrier to cloud adoption
  for large enterprises across EMEA, as cited by 63% of respondents to a Red Hat survey
  of over 900 IT managers, directors and AI engineers across nine countries. Over
  two-thirds (68%) of organisations have identified sovereignty as a top IT priority
  for the next 18 months, with that figure rising to 80% in Germany, where it ranks
  as the number one strategic focus. The importance of sovereignty stems from a convergence
  of rising operational issues, such as supply chain instability and the threat posed
  by cyber attacks, and frequently shifting geopolitical dynamics. Challenges like
  these together with the desire to harmonize the different national rules in the
  various EU countries have resulted in additional regulatory pressure, with laws
  like the Digital Operational Resilience Act (DORA) and NIS2 mandating stricter operational
  controls for critical sectors such as the financial industry. Sovereignty, therefore,
  is about resilience, and the ability to operate independently and fortify security
  without uncontrollable dependencies. This need for control and independence is prompting
  enterprises and the public sector to reevaluate the risks of viewing cloud as a
  single strategy. While cloud adoption is essential for digital transformation, traditional
  cloud models often involve ceding a degree of operational control to a handful of
  global providers, creating a potential single point of failure. Concerns about data
  privacy, foreign third-party access to data and the risk of vendor lock-in can halt
  cloud migration projects in their tracks. Open source is the bedrock of digital
  sovereignty In the quest for sovereignty, vendor-supported enterprise open source
  has emerged as a critical enabler. A massive 92% of IT managers in EMEA agree that
  enterprise open source software is an important part of achieving sovereignty. Open
  source provides transparency, control and freedom while a trusted vendor offers
  quality assurance, lifecycle management and technical support along with interoperability
  and validated integration with ecosystem partners. With access to source code and
  an upstream first development model that is decentralised and community-driven,
  organisations are not tied to a single vendor’s roadmap.
