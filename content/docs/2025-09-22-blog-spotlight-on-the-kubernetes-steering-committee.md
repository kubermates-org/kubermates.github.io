summary: 'Spotlight on the Kubernetes Steering Committee Introductions About the Steering
  Committee The road to the Steering Committee Conclusion This interview was conducted
  in August 2024, and due to the dynamic nature of the Steering Committee membership
  and election process it might not represent the actual composition accurately. The
  topics covered are, however, overwhelmingly relevant to understand its scope of
  work. As we approach the Steering Committee elections, it provides useful insights
  into the workings of the Committee. The Kubernetes Steering Committee is the backbone
  of the Kubernetes project, ensuring that its vibrant community and governance structures
  operate smoothly and effectively. While the technical brilliance of Kubernetes is
  often spotlighted through its Special Interest Groups (SIGs) and Working Groups
  (WGs) , the unsung heroes quietly steering the ship are the members of the Steering
  Committee. They tackle complex organizational challenges, empower contributors,
  and foster the thriving open source ecosystem that Kubernetes is celebrated for.
  But what does it really take to lead one of the world’s largest open source communities?
  What are the hidden challenges, and what drives these individuals to dedicate their
  time and effort to such an impactful role? In this exclusive conversation, we sit
  down with current Steering Committee (SC) members — Ben, Nabarun, Paco, Patrick,
  and Maciej — to uncover the rewarding, and sometimes demanding, realities of steering
  Kubernetes. From their personal journeys and motivations to the committee’s vital
  responsibilities and future outlook, this Spotlight offers a rare behind-the-scenes
  glimpse into the people who keep Kubernetes on course. Sandipan: Can you tell us
  a little bit about yourself? Ben : Hi, I’m Benjamin Elder , also known as BenTheElder.
  I started in Kubernetes as a Google Summer of Code student in 2015 and have been
  working at Google in the space since 2017. I have contributed a lot to many areas
  but especially build, CI, test tooling, etc. My favorite project so far was building
  KIND.'
