  Published: December 5, 2025 7 min read At DigitalOcean, our mission is to simplify
  cloud and AI to empower developers to focus on building great software. As part
  of that mission, we strive to make our tools and services accessible to developers
  in their preferred languages. Starting with GoDo , our Go SDK, we made it easy for
  developers to interact with DigitalOcean resources. Then came PyDo , our Python
  SDK, expanding support for even more ecosystems. Now, we’re excited to introduce
  DoTs. Now, our TypeScript SDK empowers developers to leverage TypeScript’s type
  safety and modern development features, enabling them to manage their DigitalOcean
  resources. In this blog, we’ll share insights into the making of DoTs and the approach
  we took to develop it. TypeScript has been a game-changer for modern development,
  especially when working on large, complex applications. By introducing static type
  checking, it helps catch errors during compilation, long before they can cause issues
  in production. This not only improves the reliability and maintainability of the
  codebase but also saves significant time and effort that would otherwise go into
  debugging post-deployment. On top of that, TypeScript enhances the developer experience
  with features like intelligent code completion, inline documentation, and clear
  error highlighting in IDEs, making the development process smoother and more efficient.
  Traditionally, building SDKs for new ecosystems required extensive manual effort,
  including writing boilerplate code in multiple programming languages.'
