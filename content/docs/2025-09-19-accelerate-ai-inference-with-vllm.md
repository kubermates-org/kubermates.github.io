  potential of a large language model (LLM) is clear, but efficiently deploying these
  powerful models in production can be challenging. This challenge is not new. In
  a recent episode of the Technically Speaking podcast, Chris Wright spoke with Nick
  Hill, a principal software engineer at Red Hat who worked on the commercialization
  of the original IBM Watson "Jeopardy!" system years ago. Hill noted that these early
  efforts focused on optimizing Watson down from a room full of servers to a single
  machine, establishing that systems-level engineering is key to making powerful AI
  practical. Wright and Hill also discussed how this same principle applies to modern
  LLMs and the vLLM open source project, which is revolutionizing AI inference by
  making AI more practical and performant at scale. [embed YouTube video here Building
  more efficient AI with vLLM ft. Nick Hill | Technically Speaking with Chris Wright
  ] vLLM is an inference server that directly addresses the efficiency and scalability
  challenges faced when working with generative AI (gen AI). By maximizing the use
  of expensive GPU resources, vLLM makes powerful AI more accessible and practical.
  Red Hat is deeply involved in the vLLM project as a significant commercial contributor.
  We have integrated a hardened, supported, and enterprise-ready version of vLLM into
  Red Hat AI Inference Server. This product is available as a standalone containerized
  offering, or as a key component of the larger Red Hat AI portfolio, including Red
  Hat Enterprise Linux AI (RHEL AI) and Red Hat OpenShift AI. Our collaboration with
  the vLLM community is a key component of our larger open source AI strategy.
