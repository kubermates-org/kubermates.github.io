  Source Summit Hyderabad offered a platform to discuss a significant shift in the
  global AI landscape: the move toward a distributed, trusted, and self-reliant AI
  model. For too long, the narrative around AI has been dominated by a few centralized
  players and proprietary platforms. That era is quickly ending. India is now part
  of this movement with its unique, development-centered approach to AI. I had the
  pleasure of presenting with Rajgopal A S, MD and CEO at NxtGen Cloud Technologies.
  Our joint presentation, "Sovereign AI in Action," showcased how this vision is being
  realized through the powerful combination of NxtGen''s SpeedCloud and Red Hat''s
  open source technologies. Organizations and nations increasingly recognize the critical
  need for digital sovereignty—the ability to independently control and safeguard
  essential digital infrastructure, data, operations, technology, and supply chains
  in alignment with their policies, values, and strategic objectives. This is particularly
  urgent in India due to several interconnected challenges: Data control and protection:
  Governments see sovereign AI as vital for protecting data privacy and safeguarding
  national security. This requires controlling where data is stored, who can access
  it, and how it’s used, often insisting on data staying within specific national
  or regional borders. The growth of data sovereignty laws and data protection rules
  worldwide means companies are having to adjust quickly. Technological independence:
  There''s also a strong desire to reduce reliance on external providers'' infrastructure
  and technologies amid geopolitical uncertainties. Currently, 95% of accelerator-enabled
  public cloud regions use US-owned accelerators, showing a concentration of control.'
