  is now available By Bikram Gupta and Dinesh Murthy Published: December 19, 2025
  4 min read The JavaScript ecosystem is rapidly evolving to meet the growing performance
  and integration demands of modern, AI-driven applications. Bun is a popular framework
  for developers that offers an all-in-one runtime, bundler, and package manager and
  is considered a drop-in replacement for Node. js. With its faster startup times
  and lower memory usage than traditional runtimes, Bun is a top request from our
  customers. Today, we’re excited to announce native Bun support on DigitalOcean App
  Platform. Now, you can deploy Bun applications directly from your code repository
  without writing a single line of configuration. App Platform’s Cloud Native Buildpacks
  will automatically detect, build, deploy and run your Bun apps. Performance: Bun
  is a modern, high-performance JavaScript runtime with integrated tooling, optimized
  for fast startup and efficient execution. Zero Configuration: You don’t need to
  maintain a Dockerfile. Just push your code into your git repo, and we’ll handle
  the runtime setup.'
