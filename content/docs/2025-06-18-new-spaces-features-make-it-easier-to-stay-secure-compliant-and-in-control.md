  \ Published: June 18, 2025 4 min read As teams grow and their cloud storage needs\
  \ scale, seemingly small issues can snowball into bigger problems. Weâ\x80\x99ve\
  \ seen common pain points emerge, like struggling to track who accessed files through\
  \ CDN endpoints, or wrestling with tricky configurations when using third-party\
  \ tools like the AWS CLI or s3cmd, plus missed audit trails, prolonged troubleshooting,\
  \ or accidental misconfigurations that can lead to data loss. Thatâ\x80\x99s why\
  \ weâ\x80\x99ve made two important updates to help simplify and strengthen the way\
  \ you manage object storage with DigitalOcean Spaces , our S3-compatible object\
  \ storage solution, built for simplicity, scalability, and affordability. Whether\
  \ youâ\x80\x99re serving up images on a website, storing large media files, managing\
  \ data backups, or powering developer workflows, Spaces helps you move fast without\
  \ managing infrastructure. These new featuresâ\x80\x94the general availability of\
  \ Spaces access logs and the introduction of the connection wizardâ\x80\x94are designed\
  \ to enhance your visibility, minimize risk, and empower you to work with greater\
  \ confidence. With access logs, you can get detailed, time-stamped records of all\
  \ file read and write requests, including traffic that flows through both Spaces\
  \ origin and CDN endpoints. Previously, there was no easy way to monitor who was\
  \ accessing your files over the CDN. That made it difficult to troubleshoot, detect\
  \ suspicious behavior, or meet compliance and audit requirements. Whatâ\x80\x99\
  s new Logs now capture both direct and CDN traffic, so you have a complete view\
  \ of object activity. Logs now capture both direct and CDN traffic, so you have\
