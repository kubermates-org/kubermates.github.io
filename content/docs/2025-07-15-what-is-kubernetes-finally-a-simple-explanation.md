  Can Actually Do Things Now Still Not Job-Ready After Learning DevOps? Well, you''re
  about to read something different. Finally, a blog that will explain "What is Kubernetes?"
  in very simple words ; an explanation for normal human beings. But Kubernetes is
  a solution to a problem. And to understand the solution, you first have to look
  at the problem it solves. Containers, containers, containers… in the voice of Steve
  Ballmer. You probably heard about Docker. But even if you didn''t, it''s no big
  deal to understand it. Docker is a set of tools that allow you to create, edit,
  and run containers. And a container is just an application in a small little box.
  What''s so cool about containers? Well, one thing is that the application has all
  that it needs (the so-called dependencies ) inside that little box. So you can take
  that container, run it on Windows, MacOS, Linux, whatever.'
