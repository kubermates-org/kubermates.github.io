  Well, you''re about to read something different. Finally, a blog that will explain
  "What is Kubernetes?" in very simple words ; an explanation for normal human beings.
  But Kubernetes is a solution to a problem. And to understand the solution, you first
  have to look at the problem it solves. Containers, containers, containers… in the
  voice of Steve Ballmer. You probably heard about Docker. But even if you didn''t,
  it''s no big deal to understand it. Docker is a set of tools that allow you to create,
  edit, and run containers. And a container is just an application in a small little
  box. What''s so cool about containers? Well, one thing is that the application has
  all that it needs (the so-called dependencies ) inside that little box. So you can
  take that container, run it on Windows, MacOS, Linux, whatever. It won''t complain
  that stuff is missing.'
