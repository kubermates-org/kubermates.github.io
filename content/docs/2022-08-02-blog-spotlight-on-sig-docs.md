summary: 'Author: Purneswar Prasad The official documentation is the go-to source
  for any open source project. For Kubernetes, it’s an ever-evolving Special Interest
  Group (SIG) with people constantly putting in their efforts to make details about
  the project easier to consume for new contributors and users. SIG Docs publishes
  the official documentation on kubernetes. io which includes, but is not limited
  to, documentation of the core APIs, core architectural details, and CLI tools shipped
  with the Kubernetes release. To learn more about the work of SIG Docs and its future
  ahead in shaping the community, I have summarised my conversation with the co-chairs,
  Divya Mohan (DM), Rey Lejano (RL) and Natali Vlatko (NV), who ran through the SIG’s
  goals and how fellow contributors can help. SIG Docs is the special interest group
  for documentation for the Kubernetes project on kubernetes. io, generating reference
  guides for the Kubernetes API, kubeadm and kubectl as well as maintaining the official
  website’s infrastructure and analytics. The remit of their work also extends to
  docs releases, translation of docs, improvement and adding new features to existing
  documentation, pushing and reviewing content for the official Kubernetes blog and
  engaging with the Release Team for each cycle to get docs and blogs reviewed. Blogs
  : This subproject highlights new or graduated Kubernetes enhancements, community
  reports, SIG updates or any relevant news to the Kubernetes community such as thought
  leadership, tutorials and project updates, such as the Dockershim removal and removal
  of PodSecurityPolicy, which is upcoming in the 1. 25 release. Tim Bannister, one
  of the SIG Docs tech leads, does awesome work and is a major force when pushing
  contributions through to the docs and blogs. Localization : With this subproject,
  the Kubernetes community has been able to achieve greater inclusivity and diversity
  among both users and contributors.'
