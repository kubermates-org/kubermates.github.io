tldr: 'Spotlight on SIG Docs Introduction A summary of the conversation Could you
  tell us a little bit about what SIG Docs does? There are 2 subprojects under Docs:
  blogs and localization. How has the community benefited from it and are there some
  interesting contributions by those teams you want to highlight? Recently there has
  been a lot of buzz around the Kubernetes ecosystem as well as the industry regarding
  the removal of dockershim in the latest 1.24 release.'

  tell us a little bit about what SIG Docs does? There are 2 subprojects under Docs:
  blogs and localization. How has the community benefited from it and are there some
  interesting contributions by those teams you want to highlight? Recently there has
  been a lot of buzz around the Kubernetes ecosystem as well as the industry regarding
  the removal of dockershim in the latest 1.24 release. How has SIG Docs helped the
  project to ensure a smooth change among the end-users? Why should new and existing
  contributors consider joining this SIG? How do you help new contributors get started?
  Are there any prerequisites to join? Any SIG related accomplishment that you’re
  really proud of? Is there something exciting coming up for the future of SIG Docs
  that you want the community to know? Wrap Up Author: Purneswar Prasad The official
  documentation is the go-to source for any open source project. For Kubernetes, it’s
  an ever-evolving Special Interest Group (SIG) with people constantly putting in
  their efforts to make details about the project easier to consume for new contributors
  and users. SIG Docs publishes the official documentation on kubernetes. io which
  includes, but is not limited to, documentation of the core APIs, core architectural
  details, and CLI tools shipped with the Kubernetes release. To learn more about
  the work of SIG Docs and its future ahead in shaping the community, I have summarised
  my conversation with the co-chairs, Divya Mohan (DM), Rey Lejano (RL) and Natali
  Vlatko (NV), who ran through the SIG’s goals and how fellow contributors can help.
  SIG Docs is the special interest group for documentation for the Kubernetes project
  on kubernetes. io, generating reference guides for the Kubernetes API, kubeadm and
  kubectl as well as maintaining the official website’s infrastructure and analytics.
  The remit of their work also extends to docs releases, translation of docs, improvement
  and adding new features to existing documentation, pushing and reviewing content
  for the official Kubernetes blog and engaging with the Release Team for each cycle
  to get docs and blogs reviewed. Blogs : This subproject highlights new or graduated
  Kubernetes enhancements, community reports, SIG updates or any relevant news to
  the Kubernetes community such as thought leadership, tutorials and project updates,
  such as the Dockershim removal and removal of PodSecurityPolicy, which is upcoming
  in the 1.25 release. Tim Bannister, one of the SIG Docs tech leads, does awesome
  work and is a major force when pushing contributions through to the docs and blogs.'
