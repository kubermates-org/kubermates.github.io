  kube-scheduler-simulator is a simulator for the Kubernetes scheduler, that started
  as a Google Summer of Code 2021 project developed by me (Kensei Nakada) and later
  received a lot of contributions. This tool allows users to closely examine the scheduler’s
  behavior and decisions. It is useful for casual users who employ scheduling constraints
  (for example, inter-Pod affinity ) and experts who extend the scheduler with custom
  plugins. The scheduler often appears as a black box, composed of many plugins that
  each contribute to the scheduling decision-making process from their unique perspectives.
  Understanding its behavior can be challenging due to the multitude of factors it
  considers. Even if a Pod appears to be scheduled correctly in a simple test cluster,
  it might have been scheduled based on different calculations than expected. This
  discrepancy could lead to unexpected scheduling outcomes when deployed in a large
  production environment. Also, testing a scheduler is a complex challenge. There
  are countless patterns of operations executed within a real cluster, making it unfeasible
  to anticipate every scenario with a finite number of tests. More often than not,
  bugs are discovered only when the scheduler is deployed in an actual cluster.
