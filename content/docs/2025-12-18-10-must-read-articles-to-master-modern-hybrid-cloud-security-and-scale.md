  Applications Virtualization Share The final quarter of the year is marked by accelerated
  innovation. Red Hat is leading the way by integrating AI into management, fortifying
  our security foundations, and readying your infrastructure for both present and
  future demands like quantum computing and highly scaled virtualization. This month
  brought significant platform updates across Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) and
  Red Hat OpenShift, along with key insights from our performance engineering teams.
  The following articles provide the essential technical and strategic information
  you need to make the most of your hybrid cloud journey. What''s new in RHEL 10.1:
  Offline assistance, convenient AI accelerators, and more The RHEL team continues
  to evolve your security-hardened foundation. The latest RHEL 10.1 update is a significant
  step, especially for those in highly secure or air-gapped environments. We’re excited
  to announce the developer preview of an offline, locally available RHEL command-line
  assistant for customers with Red Hat Satellite. This means AI-powered guidance on
  troubleshooting and installation is now available without external network access,
  prioritizing your security. Plus, RHEL 10.1 makes embracing AI easier than ever
  by providing vendor-validated AI accelerator drivers directly in our trusted repositories.
  You’ll also find soft-reboots for minimal downtime and a host of updated developer
  toolsets, supporting an environment that is modern, efficient, and ready for what’s
  next. Red Hat Insights is now Red Hat Lightspeed: Accelerating AI-powered management
  We’re taking the management and analytics capabilities you know and trust to the
  next level. Red Hat Insights is now Red Hat Lightspeed, a transition that reflects
  our expanded commitment to intelligent, AI-powered management across RHEL, Red Hat
  OpenShift, and Red Hat Ansible Automation Platform.'
