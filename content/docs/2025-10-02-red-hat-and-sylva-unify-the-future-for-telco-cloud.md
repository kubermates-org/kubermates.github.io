  provider landscape continues to be rewritten with the coming of 5G Advanced, edge
  computing, automation, and AI. But realizing their full potential demands a continued
  shift in infrastructure for service providers to be more agile and efficient. Cloud-native
  architectures and open source principles have emerged as the path forward, offering
  the flexibility and speed needed to differentiate from offering pure connectivity.
  Yet, a significant challenge of fragmentation persists thanks to complex islands
  of legacy infrastructure and technical debt that have built up over the years. For
  service providers, this involves managing multiple stacks and skill sets. For vendors,
  it means costly, time-consuming certifications against numerous platforms. The industry
  is looking for ways to reduce operational costs, speed up service rollouts to drive
  new revenue, and capitalize on the full agility that cloud-native technologies and
  methodologies promise. Introducing Sylva Sylva is an open source project initiated
  by five of Europe’s largest service providers, Orange, Deutsche Telekom, Vodafone,
  Telefónica, and Telecom Italia, along with network providers Ericsson and Nokia,
  and has expanded to include many more participants. Its objective is to release
  a cloud software framework tailored for telco and edge requirements and a reference
  implementation and validation program to implement it. By converging the cloud layer
  around open source components with Kubernetes at its core, Sylva eliminates fragmentation.
  It establishes a single, validated foundation upon which network functions can be
  certified once and run anywhere, reducing complexity and unlocking the operational
  agility service providers desperately need. This “develop once, deploy anywhere”
  model is Red Hat’s core proposition and our hybrid cloud platforms align directly
  with the goals of Sylva.
