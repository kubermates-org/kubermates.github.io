  \ to security and simplicity. This means that when you build on DigitalOcean, you\
  \ build on a foundation of proven security practices and controls. As an example,\
  \ consider the following: Security: Based on the cloud product in use, customers\
  \ inherit a portion of DigitalOceanâ\x80\x99s security posture under the Shared\
  \ Responsibility Model. By using a SOC 2 compliant product, customers can be more\
  \ confident that they can manage their risk footprint to the requirements of that\
  \ standard. Security: Based on the cloud product in use, customers inherit a portion\
  \ of DigitalOceanâ\x80\x99s security posture under the Shared Responsibility Model.\
  \ By using a SOC 2 compliant product, customers can be more confident that they\
  \ can manage their risk footprint to the requirements of that standard. Simplicity:\
  \ Many regulatory regimes have overlapping compliance requirements as the SOC 2,\
  \ therefore helping you further enhance your own compliance objectives. SOC 2 is\
  \ one of three SOC standards ( SOC 1, SOC 2, and SOC 3 ) developed by the American\
  \ Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA) which assess an organizationâ\x80\
  \x99s controls against the applicable Trust Services Criteria, which include some\
  \ combination of the following: Security, availability, processing integrity, confidentiality,\
  \ and privacy."
