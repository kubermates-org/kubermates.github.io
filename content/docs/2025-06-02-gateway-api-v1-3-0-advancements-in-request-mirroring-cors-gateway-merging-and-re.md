  Get involved Related Kubernetes blog articles Join us in the Kubernetes SIG Network
  community in celebrating the general availability of Gateway API v1. 3. 0! We are
  also pleased to announce that there are already a number of conformant implementations
  to try, made possible by postponing this blog announcement. Version 1. 3. 0 of the
  API was released about a month ago on April 24, 2025. Gateway API v1. 3. 0 brings
  a new feature to the Standard channel (Gateway API''s GA release channel): percentage-based
  request mirroring , and introduces three new experimental features: cross-origin
  resource sharing (CORS) filters, a standardized mechanism for listener and gateway
  merging, and retry budgets. Also see the full release notes and applaud the v1.'
