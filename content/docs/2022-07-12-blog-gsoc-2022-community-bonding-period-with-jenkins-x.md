summary: 'Hello everyone, I am Rajat Gupta, pursuing my bachelor’s in Information
  Technology. In 2022, I have been selected as a student developer in Google Summer
  of Code under Jenkins X. We will be building a new UI for Jenkins X. I got this
  news on May 20th, as I received an email from google. The technologies needed were
  Golang , Kubernetes , and GitOps. I used golang only once before, while linting
  Jenkins X codebase, I only used Kubernetes once before while setting up a k3s cluster
  to run Jenkins X pipelines. These tasks were necessary to do for all GSoC participants.
  Apart from that, I was a total beginner. So, when I got selected, I had a lot to
  learn, my mentors gave me a 30 Day plan. They also suggested some resources and
  conference talks which made it simple for me to start. 30 Day plan was: We also
  had some amazing pair programming sessions, where I used to share my screen and
  my mentor guided me through, which is not common because mentors have a very busy
  schedule. But my mentors helped me a lot.'
