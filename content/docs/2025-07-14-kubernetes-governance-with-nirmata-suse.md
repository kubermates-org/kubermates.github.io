  Manager Here’s how to find it: Why This Partnership Matters for You Happy Monday,
  cloud-native enthusiasts! We’re thrilled to share some exciting news that marks
  a significant milestone for Nirmata and the broader Kubernetes community. We are
  proud to announce that Nirmata is now officially approved and listed in the SUSE
  Partner Certification & Solutions Catalog! This achievement isn’t just a badge;
  it’s a testament to our commitment to providing robust, integrated solutions that
  simplify Kubernetes governance and management to enhance security for enterprises.
  For users of SUSE and Rancher, this partnership opens up new avenues for streamlined
  operations and greater control over their cloud-native environments. One of the
  most immediate benefits of this partnership is the seamless availability of Nirmata
  within the Rancher ecosystem. You can now easily access Nirmata directly from your
  Rancher Manager interface. Navigate to Apps → Charts within your Rancher Manager,
  and you’ll find Nirmata listed in the Rancher Partner Catalog. This direct integration
  makes it incredibly easy for Rancher users to discover, deploy, and leverage Nirmata’s
  capabilities for Kubernetes governance, policy management, governance, and security.
  This collaboration between Nirmata and SUSE/Rancher brings together two powerful
  platforms to address critical needs in the cloud-native landscape: Enhanced K8s
  Governance and Security: Nirmata provides a comprehensive policy engine that allows
  organizations to define, enforce, and audit policies across their Kubernetes clusters.
  This is crucial for maintaining security posture, ensuring compliance, and enforcing
  operational best practices, especially in multi-cluster and hybrid cloud environments
  managed by Rancher. Simplified Operations: By integrating with Rancher Manager,
  Nirmata makes it even easier for platform teams to gain visibility and control over
  their Kubernetes deployments. From admission control to runtime security, Nirmata
  streamlines complex tasks , allowing teams to focus on innovation rather than operational
  overhead. Accelerated Adoption: For enterprises already invested in the SUSE/Rancher
  ecosystem, this partnership means they can confidently extend their capabilities
  with Nirmata, knowing that the solutions are certified, integrated, and designed
  to work together seamlessly.'
