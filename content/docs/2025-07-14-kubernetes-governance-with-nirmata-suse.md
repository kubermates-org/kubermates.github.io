  For users of SUSE and Rancher, this partnership opens up new avenues for streamlined
  operations and greater control over their cloud-native environments. One of the
  most immediate benefits of this partnership is the seamless availability of Nirmata
  within the Rancher ecosystem. You can now easily access Nirmata directly from your
  Rancher Manager interface. Navigate to Apps → Charts within your Rancher Manager,
  and you’ll find Nirmata listed in the Rancher Partner Catalog. This direct integration
  makes it incredibly easy for Rancher users to discover, deploy, and leverage Nirmata’s
  capabilities for Kubernetes governance, policy management, governance, and security.
  This collaboration between Nirmata and SUSE/Rancher brings together two powerful
  platforms to address critical needs in the cloud-native landscape: We are incredibly
  excited about the possibilities this partnership unlocks. By combining Nirmata’s
  powerful policy-based management with SUSE and Rancher’s robust Kubernetes management
  platform, we are empowering organizations to achieve greater agility, security,
  and efficiency in their cloud-native journeys. We encourage all SUSE and Rancher
  users to explore Nirmata in the Rancher Partner Catalog and the Partner Certification
  and Solutions Catalog , and see firsthand how our integrated solution can transform
  your Kubernetes governance and security operations. Stay tuned for more updates
  as we continue to deepen our collaboration with SUSE/Rancher and contribute to a
  more secure and manageable cloud-native future! To see what all the buzz is about
