  Applications Virtualization Share It’s the peak traffic hour on a busy weekday evening.
  A common occurrence for a typical telecommunication (telco) service provider. Millions
  of subscribers are streaming videos, playing games, and making calls. Suddenly,
  a network outage occurs in a key metropolitan area. Level 3 (L3) operations team
  at the service provider would begin troubleshooting the incident. They would manually
  sift through logs across multiple domains (radio access network, core, transport)
  and race against time to restore services. Hours, sometimes days, could pass before
  the incident was fully resolved, leading to frustrated customers, lost revenue,
  and reputational damage. How different would the situation have been if artificial
  intelligence (AI) was involved? An agentic AI-driven network would detect anomalies
  in real time, identifying the root cause and resolving the issue autonomously before
  customers even noticed a problem. Operations teams would be able to move from a
  reactive posture to a proactive one, focusing instead on strategic innovation and
  customer experience. Building AI-driven autonomous intelligent networks The telco
  industry is at a pivotal moment. With 5G fully deployed, and 5G advanced and 6G
  on the horizon, networks are more complex and data-intensive than ever. Manual approaches
  to network deployment and operations simply cannot keep up with the scale of current
  and future demand.'
