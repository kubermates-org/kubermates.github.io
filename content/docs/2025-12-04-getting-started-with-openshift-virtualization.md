  Virtualization Share There are many reasons you might be running a virtual machine
  (VM) at your organization, and you''re probably also using or planning to use containers
  at the same time. Whether you''re looking to migrate away from your current virtualization
  platform or you''re just looking for a unified platform for both VMs and containers,
  Red Hat OpenShift is a centralized control center for all the services you provide
  to your users. Here''s how to get started with OpenShift Virtualization, a feature
  of Red Hat OpenShift. To use OpenShift Virtualization, you must have access to a
  bare metal OpenShift cluster. There are several ways to install OpenShift: Interactive
  : Deploy a cluster with the web-based Assisted Installer. This provides smart and
  safe defaults, and performs several pre-flight validations before installing a cluster.
  Local agent : In an air-gapped or network-restricted environment, you can deploy
  a cluster locally with the agent-based installer. Automated : Deploy a cluster on
  infrastructure provisioned by the installer using your host''s baseboard management
  controller (BMC). Full control : Deploy a cluster on your own infrastructure.'
