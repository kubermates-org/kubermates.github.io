  Kubernetes. While it excels at handling containerised applications at scale, it

  10 Kubernetes troubleshooting techniques that every DevOps engineer should master.

  common and critical Kubernetes issues quickly and reliably. One of the most common
  and frustrating issues in Kubernetes is when a pod repeatedly crashes during restarts;
  a situation known as the CrashLoopBackOff error. This occurs when a container fails
  to start correctly, and Kubernetes continually attempts to restart it, resulting
  in a loop of failures.'
