  \ business. TL;DR: We built some new features for Kubernetes platform. Get started\
  \ with some quick-links below: â\x80\x93>Not a customer yet? Spin up a Kubernetes\
  \ cluster in minutes. â\x80\x93>Already a customer? Explore the new features by\
  \ logging into your DigitalOcean account. You can now deploy GPU-accelerated workloads\
  \ on DigitalOcean Managed Kubernetes using our latest GPU Droplet types (both NVIDIA\
  \ and AMD ). These new instance types are ideal for AI/ML training and inference,\
  \ image and video processing, and other compute-intensive workloads. With native\
  \ support for GPU nodes in your Kubernetes clusters, you get the flexibility of\
  \ containers with the raw power of high-performance GPUs-fully integrated into the\
  \ DOKS experience. Here are the new GPU Droplet types: This feature allows a node\
  \ pool to automatically scale down to zero nodes when there are no active workloads\
  \ that require those nodes. You can now enable the node pools within your Kubernetes\
  \ environment to automatically scale down to zero when idle, stopping compute charges\
  \ during those periods of inactivity. This feature is optimal for development or\
  \ testing environments, applications with usage patterns tied to business hours\
  \ that naturally yield idle periods, or workloads that use specialized node pools\
  \ like GPU or CPU-Optimized for intermittent jobs. The main components of this feature\
  \ include: 1."
