summary: 'In the DevOps world, container orchestration is often synonymous with Kubernetes,
  a platform for deploying and managing container-based workloads in production. Since
  its debut in 2014, Kubernetes has seen a meteoric rise in its adoption and popularity.
  Despite being a relatively new technology, it is now used by a vast number of organizations,
  from small start-ups to large enterprises, so much so that it has become a standard
  in the industry. Kubernetes benefits from strong community support and boasts a
  rich ecosystem of tools and extensions. It is continuously being developed and improved,
  and judging by the current trends, Kubernetes is only going to get stronger in the
  future. In this blog post, we’ll discuss why you should consider using Kubernetes
  , scenarios where Kubernetes might not be the ideal solution, and explore some of
  its alternatives. Let’s get started! Kubernetes offers several key features that
  cater to a wide range of application deployment and management needs. Here are the
  top three features of Kubernetes that make it particularly suitable for modern software
  development: In recent years, the microservices approach ( where software systems
  are developed as a collection of small, independent services ) has become increasingly
  popular in software development. Kubernetes provides many abstractions and APIs
  that are particularly well-suited to the requirements and characteristics of a microservices
  architecture. Here''s how Kubernetes simplifies the deployment and management of
  microservices: One of the standout features of Kubernetes is its ability to auto-scale
  applications in response to fluctuating traffic demands. When production systems
  experience spikes or drops in traffic, Kubernetes seamlessly steps in to adjust
  resources. It achieves this through two key scaling strategies: In addition to horizontal
  and vertical scaling, Kubernetes excels in cloud-based scalability, using a feature
  known as the Cluster Autoscaler.'
