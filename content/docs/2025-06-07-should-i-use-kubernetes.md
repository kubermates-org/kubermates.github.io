  Do Things Now Still Not Job-Ready After Learning DevOps? What Is Kubernetes? Finally,
  a Simple Explanation! Since its debut in 2014, Kubernetes has seen a meteoric rise
  in its adoption and popularity. Despite being a relatively new technology, it is
  now used by a vast number of organizations, from small start-ups to large enterprises,
  so much so that it has become a standard in the industry. Kubernetes benefits from
  strong community support and boasts a rich ecosystem of tools and extensions. It
  is continuously being developed and improved, and judging by the current trends,
  Kubernetes is only going to get stronger in the future. In this blog post, we’ll
  discuss why you should consider using Kubernetes , scenarios where Kubernetes might
  not be the ideal solution, and explore some of its alternatives. Let’s get started!
  Kubernetes offers several key features that cater to a wide range of application
  deployment and management needs. Here are the top three features of Kubernetes that
  make it particularly suitable for modern software development: In recent years,
  the microservices approach ( where software systems are developed as a collection
  of small, independent services ) has become increasingly popular in software development.
  Kubernetes provides many abstractions and APIs that are particularly well-suited
  to the requirements and characteristics of a microservices architecture. Here''s
  how Kubernetes simplifies the deployment and management of microservices: Containerization
  support : Kubernetes is designed to manage containers, which are ideal for microservices.
  Each microservice can be packaged into its own container, encapsulating its dependencies
  and runtime environment. This makes it easy to deploy and manage microservices consistently
  and reliably.'
