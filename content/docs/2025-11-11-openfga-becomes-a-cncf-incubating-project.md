  Components Notable Milestones Looking Ahead Posted on November 11, 2025 by OpenFGA
  Project Maintainers CNCF projects highlighted in this post The CNCF Technical Oversight
  Committee (TOC) has voted to accept OpenFGA as a CNCF incubating project. OpenFGA
  is an authorization engine that addresses the challenge of implementing complex
  access control at scale in modern software applications. Inspired by Google’s global
  access control system, Zanzibar, OpenFGA leverages Relationship-Based Access Control
  (ReBAC). This allows developers to define permissions based on relationships between
  users and objects (e. g. , who can view which document). By serving as an external
  service with an API and multiple SDKs, it centralizes and abstracts the authorization
  logic out of the application code. This separation of concerns significantly improves
  developer velocity by simplifying security implementation and ensures that access
  rules are consistent, scalable, and easy to audit across all services, solving a
  critical complexity problem for developers building distributed systems. OpenFGA
  was developed by a group of Okta employees, and is the foundation for the Auth0
  FGA commercial offering. The project was accepted as a CNCF Sandbox project in September
  2022. Since then, it has been deployed by hundreds of companies and received multiple
  contributions. Some major moments and updates include: 37 companies publicly acknowledge
  using it in production.'
