  Virtualization Share At Red Hat, our goal is to provide enterprise-grade automation
  solutions that evolve with your needs. As part of this commitment, we are deprecating
  the Red Hat ServiceNow Notification Service application from the ServiceNow Store.
  This isn''t a reduction in capability; it''s an evolution. We''re moving away from
  a simplified, one-size-fits-all application to more robust and modern integration
  patterns that offer the capabilities required by enterprise IT environments. The
  Red Hat ServiceNow Notification Service application was designed for simplicity,
  providing a straightforward way to send the entire ServiceNow record as a JavaScript
  Object Notation (JSON) payload to Event-Driven Ansible. In the past, the application
  was required to integrate ServiceNow with Event-Driven Ansible. While it served
  as an effective entry point for using ServiceNow with Event-Driven Ansible, our
  customers'' automation needs have matured. Today, more control over data, more complex
  triggering logic, and more targeted, request-driven automation is required. To better
  serve the advanced requirements of our customers, we are standardizing on 3 different
  fully supported integration pathways for ServiceNow and Event-Driven Ansible. Customers
  should use 1 of 3 more capable and flexible integration methods. These options enable
  customized payloads, enrich event data, and build sophisticated workflows that organizations
  demand. All of these integration options are fully supported by ServiceNow, taking
  advantage of standard ServiceNow capabilities.'
