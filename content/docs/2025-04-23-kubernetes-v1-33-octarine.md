  Similar to previous releases, the release of Kubernetes v1. 33 introduces new stable,
  beta, and alpha features. The consistent delivery of high-quality releases underscores
  the strength of our development cycle and the vibrant support from our community.
  This release consists of 64 enhancements. Of those enhancements, 18 have graduated
  to Stable, 20 are entering Beta, 24 have entered Alpha, and 2 are deprecated or
  withdrawn. There are also several notable deprecations and removals in this release;
  make sure to read about those if you already run an older version of Kubernetes.
  The theme for Kubernetes v1. 33 is Octarine: The Color of Magic 1 , inspired by
  Terry Pratchett’s Discworld series. This release highlights the open source magic
  2 that Kubernetes enables across the ecosystem.'
