summary: 'Editors: Agustina Barbetta, Aakanksha Bhende, Udi Hofesh, Ryota Sawada,
  Sneha Yadav Similar to previous releases, the release of Kubernetes v1. 33 introduces
  new stable, beta, and alpha features. The consistent delivery of high-quality releases
  underscores the strength of our development cycle and the vibrant support from our
  community. This release consists of 64 enhancements. Of those enhancements, 18 have
  graduated to Stable, 20 are entering Beta, 24 have entered Alpha, and 2 are deprecated
  or withdrawn. There are also several notable deprecations and removals in this release;
  make sure to read about those if you already run an older version of Kubernetes.
  The theme for Kubernetes v1. 33 is Octarine: The Color of Magic 1 , inspired by
  Terry Pratchett’s Discworld series. This release highlights the open source magic
  2 that Kubernetes enables across the ecosystem. If you’re familiar with the world
  of Discworld, you might recognize a small swamp dragon perched atop the tower of
  the Unseen University, gazing up at the Kubernetes moon above the city of Ankh-Morpork
  with 64 stars 3 in the background. As Kubernetes moves into its second decade, we
  celebrate both the wizardry of its maintainers, the curiosity of new contributors,
  and the collaborative spirit that fuels the project. The v1.'
