  found that most developers spend roughly one day each week tackling development
  and IT inefficiencies 1. This is way too much overhead for an organization’s most
  important source of innovation. That’s why we are very excited about the newly expanded
  partnership between Broadcom and Canonical announced today at Explore 2025 in Las
  Vegas that will power high velocity, no friction containerized workload deployments
  on VMware Cloud Foundation (VCF). It brings together the #1 Private Cloud platform
  with the #1 Cloud OS to help customers who are building Kubernetes-based modern
  applications streamline support, improve developer efficiency, manage security risks,
  and simplify AI workload deployment. VCF 9. 0 delivers a unified, AI-ready private
  cloud platform to manage traditional as well as modern containerized applications.
  Customers get a unified cloud experience reducing friction and significantly increasing
  developer productivity and experience. This partnership will further streamline
  the deployment of container-based and AI applications. Fueling Private Cloud Momentum
  VCF with vSphere Kubernetes Service (VKS) is the leading platform of choice for
  modern private clouds. VKS is Broadcom’s enterprise-grade upstream conformant CNCF
  certified Kubernetes distribution, offered as part of VCF. It is easy to install,
  upgrade, scale, and manage as a multi-cluster deployment delivering a seamless self-service
  experience. Centralized policy management for access control, networking, security,
  image registries, and runtime configurations across diverse Kubernetes environments
  simplifies compliance and governance at scale.'
