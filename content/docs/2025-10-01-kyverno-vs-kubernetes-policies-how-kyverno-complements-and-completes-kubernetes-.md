  Policy Types Do You Still Need Kyverno with the new Kubernetes Policy Types? Introduction
  1. Applying Policies On Existing Resources 2. Reapplying Policies On Changes 3.
  Applying Policies Off Cluster (Shift-Left) 4. Testing Policy as Code 5. Reporting
  Policy Results 6. Managing Fine-Grained Policy Exceptions 7. Complex Policy Logic

  FAQ: Kyverno vs Kubernetes Policies What is the difference between Kyverno and Kubernetes
  policies? Can Kyverno replace Kubernetes ValidatingAdmissionPolicy? Why do I need
  Kyverno if Kubernetes already has policies? With the addition of ValidatingAdmissionPolicy
  and MutatingAdmissionPolicy in Kubernetes, do you still need Kyverno? TL;DR: Yes,
  you still need Kyverno for applying policies on existing resources, complex logic,
  reporting, testing, and off-cluster / shift-left use cases! Read on for details:
  Prior to Kyverno, policy management in Kubernetes was complex and cumbersome. While
  the need for Policy as Code was clear, initial implementations required learning
  complex languages and did not implement the full policy as code lifecycle.'
