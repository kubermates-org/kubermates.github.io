  That’s where Workload Placement in VMware Cloud Foundation (VCF) comes in. It finds
  the ideal cluster or host for each VM by evaluating real-time capacity, performance
  data, and your organization’s business or operational intent. In short, it helps
  ensure every workload lands exactly where it should — without the manual guesswork.
  If you’ve ever had to manually decide where to deploy a new workload, you know how
  easy it is to create resource hotspots or imbalance within your clusters. Workload
  Placement eliminates that uncertainty. By continuously analyzing real-time capacity
  and performance metrics, VCF automatically recommends — or even performs — optimal
  VM placements. This ensures your workloads meet performance, compliance, and cost
  objectives while freeing your teams to focus on innovation instead of firefighting.
  Think of Workload Placement as a smart room planner for your data center. Each VM
  is a piece of furniture — some large, some small, all with specific needs. The clusters
  and hosts are rooms with varying space, lighting, and features.'
