summary: Framing the Challenge Why This Matters Supporting Innovation Through Infrastructure
  Real-World Impact Conclusion & Next Steps Posted on November 5, 2025 by Ihor Dvoretskyi,
  Sr. Developer Advocate, Cloud Native Computing Foundation Akamai , a CNCF Gold member
  since 2023 and a committed supporter of open source infrastructure, is generously
  donating $1,000,000 in annual cloud credits. The donation will support both the
  Linux Foundation and Cloud Native Computing Foundation. As cloud native technologies
  evolve to address AI, edge, and platform engineering demands, the infrastructure
  required to build, test, and scale these projects grows more complex. CI/CD pipelines,
  release testing, and performance benchmarking often require significant compute
  power. Community-led projects can struggle to access the necessary infrastructure
  without dependable support. Cloud credit donations are critical for enabling sustainable
  project operations without shifting costs to maintainers. Akamai’s credit contribution
  will allow CNCF to better support scalable, resilient infrastructure that benefits
  a range of technical initiatives. “We’re incredibly grateful for Akamai’s infrastructure
  contribution—it’s the kind of support that helps our community scale—experiment—and
  push cloud native innovation forward,” said Chris Aniszczyk, CTO of the Cloud Native
  Computing Foundation. “When our members invest like this, it strengthens the resilience
  and long-term impact of the entire ecosystem. ” As a Gold member, Akamai has deepened
  its collaboration with CNCF to ensure that projects can access the cloud infrastructure
  they need to thrive. We will direct the credits toward supporting project infrastructure
  needs.
