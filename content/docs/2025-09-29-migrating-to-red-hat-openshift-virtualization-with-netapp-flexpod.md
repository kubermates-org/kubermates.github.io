  Security Edge computing Infrastructure Applications Virtualization Share The path
  to virtualization started decades ago. Early efforts with mainframes in the 1960s
  allowed multiple operating systems to run on the same hardware. In the late 1990s,
  the virtualization of x86 hardware was introduced, and reshaped the way organizations
  deployed, managed, and scaled IT infrastructure. Applications were no longer bound
  to a single server. They could be moved at will, and even scaled to meet demand.
  Entire businesses and careers have been built on what we now know as traditional
  virtualization. And even as public cloud computing has become more accessible, traditional
  virtualization continues to evolve and will be with us for some time. Gartner projects
  that “70% of x86 datacenter workloads will continue to use hypervisor-based virtualization
  through 2027” Even highly effective traditions must evolve to meet changing needs.
  Today, organizations face pressures that are forcing them to reassess long-standing
  virtualization strategies, including: Changes in market pricing: Recent changes
  to licensing and increased prices has many organizations exploring more cost-effective
  alternatives. The rise of cloud-native development: Modern application development
  is moving towards a microservices architecture, where applications are split into
  small, independent components. Containers are the widely accepted standard for this
  approach. Many businesses are looking for ways to adopt these modern development
  practices without abandoning existing infrastructure.'
