  down to KubeCon North America 2025 – Let’s Chat! Platform engineers, are you grappling
  with the inherent complexities of Kubernetes at scale? The promise of modern software
  delivery often collides with the realities of intricate configurations, distributed
  operations, and the sheer volume of new applications. If you’re seeking a more streamlined,
  secure, and efficient way to manage your Kubernetes environments, then the IDC Spotlight
  paper, “ Enabling Platform Engineers to Overcome Kubernetes Complexity with a Modern
  Private Cloud Platform ,” is a must-read. This Broadcom-sponsored IDC paper dives
  deep into the challenges and opportunities facing platform engineers today. It offers
  a third-party perspective on the critical need for modern platform engineering approaches
  that empower developers with self-service capabilities, while ensuring robust governance,
  cost control, and security. The paper explores key trends, including: The tidal
  wave of new applications – With IDC projecting over 1 billion net-new applications
  by 2028, the demand for efficient container orchestration is skyrocketing. The advent
  of Kubernetes – Kubernetes has become crucial for modern software delivery, including
  new AI application delivery, but its inherent complexity limits scalability, especially
  when managing distributed operations and ensuring security and governance. The rise
  of platform engineering – This discipline is crucial for removing developer toil
  but requires better tools and a more robust platform to manage the rising complexity
  of Kubernetes at scale. The shift to private clouds – A growing number of organizations
  are repatriating workloads from public clouds to on-premises private clouds, driven
  by performance and security needs, especially for AI-powered applications. A key
  takeaway from the IDC paper is the emergence of modern private cloud platforms.
  These platforms are designed to assist platform engineering teams in effectively
  managing Kubernetes at scale across their full spectrum of enterprise applications.
  It details how solutions like VMware Cloud Foundation (VCF) provide an integrated
  stack of capabilities designed to automate deployment, configuration, and life-cycle
  management in a pre-validated, pre-integrated private cloud platform. For platform
  engineers, VCF offers : Operational simplicity & scalability – Enterprise-grade
  scaling for production Kubernetes workloads and simplified provisioning environments.'
