  Share Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) system administrators and developers have
  long relied on a specific set of tools to diagnose issues, combined with years of
  accumulated intuition and experience. But as environments grow more complex, the
  cognitive load required to effectively decipher logs and troubleshoot issues has
  been increasing. Today, we are excited to announce the developer preview of a new
  Model Context Protocol (MCP) server for RHEL. This new MCP server is designed to
  bridge the gap between RHEL and Large Language Models (LLMs), enabling a new era
  of smarter troubleshooting. MCP is an open standard that allows AI models to interact
  with external data and systems, originally released by Anthropic and donated in
  December 2025 to the Linux Foundation''s Agentic AI Foundation. RHEL''s new MCP
  server is now in developer preview and uses this protocol to provide direct, context-aware
  access to RHEL from AI applications that support the MCP protocol, such as Claude
  Desktop or goose. We have previously released MCP servers for Red Hat Lightspeed
  , and Red Hat Satellite that enable a number of exciting use cases. This new MCP
  server expands on these use cases, and is purpose-built for deep-dive troubleshooting
  on RHEL systems. Connecting your LLM to RHEL with the new MCP server enables use
  cases such as: Intelligent log analysis: Sifting through log data is tedious. The
  MCP server allows LLMs to ingest and analyze RHEL system logs. This capability enables
  AI-driven root cause analysis and anomaly detection, helping you to turn raw log
  data into actionable intelligence. Performance analysis: The MCP server can access
  information about the number of CPUs, load average, memory information, and information
  about CPU and memory usage of running processes.'
