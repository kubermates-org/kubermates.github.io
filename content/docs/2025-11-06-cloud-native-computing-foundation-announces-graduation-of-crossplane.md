summary: 'Graduation marks Crossplane’s readiness for widespread use and its evolution
  from a control plane framework to groundwork for intelligent, secure, and scalable
  cloud operations and platform engineering Key Highlights: Crossplane has officially
  graduated within the CNCF project ecosystem, recognizing its maturity, wide adoption,
  and strong community, along with its importance in platform engineering. With over
  3,000 contributors from more than 450 organizations, Crossplane ranks in the top
  10% of all CNCF projects for contributor engagement and authorship. Crossplane has
  delivered over 100 releases, including the recent Crossplane v2.0, which introduces
  a more refined architecture for building full application control planes and enhances
  support for AI-driven operations. Crossplane is now a graduated CNCF project and
  is available for production use today. SAN FRANCISCO, Calif. – November 6, 2025
  – The Cloud Native Computing Foundation® (CNCF®), which builds sustainable ecosystems
  for cloud native software, today announced the graduation of Crossplane , recognizing
  its maturity, wide adoption, and strong community momentum, along with its importance
  in cloud native platform engineering. Crossplane brings the universal contract of
  declarative APIs to cloud infrastructure, applications, and services. It turns infrastructure
  into programmable, policy-driven software, enabling both humans and intelligent
  agents to request and manage environments safely through APIs rather than scripts
  or tickets. As AI begins to drive the need for more operations, Crossplane’s architecture
  offers the predictability and safety required for automation. Its declarative model
  allows intelligent agents to operate cloud environments by targeting outcomes instead
  of executing instructions, helping bridge human-operated and AI-operated infrastructure.
  “Crossplane’s graduation marks a major milestone for cloud native and multi cloud
  platform engineering,” said Chris Aniszczyk, CTO, CNCF. “Crossplane empowers teams
  to build secure, scalable internal platforms.'
