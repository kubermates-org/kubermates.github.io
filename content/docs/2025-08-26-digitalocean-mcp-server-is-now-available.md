  \ Server video walkthrough: â\x86\x92 Explore the Model Context Protocol (MCP) Overview\
  \ Model Context Protocol (MCP) is an open-source standard that streamlines how AI\
  \ systems like large language models (LLMs) connect with external tools, systems,\
  \ and data sources. It defines a standard and consistent way to manage and share\
  \ context across machine learning components, replacing fragmented integrations.\
  \ An MCP Server acts as a bridge between an AI application and these external resources.\
  \ Learn more about the DigitalOcean MCP Server Now supports 9 services (and growing):\
  \ Accounts , App Platform , Databases , DOKS , Droplets , Insights , Marketplace\
  \ , Networking , and Spaces Storage. Instead of juggling multiple dashboards or\
  \ tools, you can manage common cloud operations right inside your favorite MCP-compatible\
  \ tools. Turn plain English into real API actions. No more digging through docs\
  \ or writing scripts â\x80\x93 just ask your AI assistant. Examples: Deploy and\
  \ Manage Apps: Run commands like deploy a Ruby on Rails app from my GitHub repo\
  \ or check which apps are on my account. Create and Manage Databases: Easily provision\
  \ a new PostgreSQL database or create a new database. For example, you could use\
  \ the command create a new PostgreSQL database named \"my-project-db\" with PostgreSQL\
  \ version 14 and it would do so in no time."
