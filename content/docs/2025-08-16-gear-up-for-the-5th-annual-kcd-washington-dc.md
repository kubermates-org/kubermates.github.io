  DC Organizer We’re so thrilled to be organizing another year of cloud native community
  in the Nation’s Capital. Past years have witnessed amazing presentations ranging
  from core Kubernetes topics to emerging trends in ML/AI, sustainability, virtual
  clusters and more. This year promises to be even more amazing. Our program is set,
  and includes two new innovations for our KCD: Special Government & Cybersecurity
  Focus – and free admission for our government employee community members! You won’t
  want to miss Ashley Jones’ keynote if you’re a cybersecurity professional or involved
  in government technology in any way. A limited number of free tickets will be available
  soon for our community members working for federal, state or local government agencies.
  You can request a free government ticket here: https://forms. gle/aLNfRwpvFn3vQ5Vo8
  Plus our regular program is amazing! All of that rests on top of our regular program
  that includes presentations like: …. and a whole lot more, which you can see in
  the Full Schedule [https://kcd-washington-dc-2025. sessionize. com/] And there’s
  plenty of food, drinks and networking Once again, we plan on hosting an evening
  Social Hour free for all attendees where you can meet fellow attendees, speakers,
  and sponsors, in a relaxed, community environment while enjoying drinks and appetizers.
  And, of course, you can enjoy all-day snacks, beverages (tea, coffee, soft drinks)
  and a nutritious lunch, all included with your one-day ticket. That’s a pretty good
  value for $75, and to make it even more inviting, we’re offering 25% for all CNCF
  readers using code FRIENDS25 when you Get Tickets [https://bit.'
