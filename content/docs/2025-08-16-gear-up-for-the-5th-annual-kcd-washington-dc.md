  DC Organizer We’re so thrilled to be organizing another year of cloud native community
  in the Nation’s Capital. Past years have witnessed amazing presentations ranging
  from core Kubernetes topics to emerging trends in ML/AI, sustainability, virtual
  clusters and more. This year promises to be even more amazing. Our program is set,
  and includes two new innovations for our KCD: For the first time, we’re offering
  a hands-on workshop covering basic and intermediate topics on using Prometheus in
  your observability practice. The curriculum covers 20-25% of the Linux Foundation’s
  Prometheus Certified Associate (PCA) course. While this workshop does not lead to
  certification, and is not a substitute for the PCA course, it will give you a solid
  working knowledge for getting started and perhaps help you decide if you’d like
  to pursue certification separately – if you do, you’ll be ahead of the game with
  this solid foundation. We’re adding a government-focused cybersecurity keynote by
  our special guest, Ashley Jones, Cybersecurity Advisor for Region III of the Department
  of Homeland Security, Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA. )
  Special Government & Cybersecurity Focus – and free admission for our government
  employee community members! You won’t want to miss Ashley Jones’ keynote if you’re
  a cybersecurity professional or involved in government technology in any way. A
  limited number of free tickets will be available soon for our community members
  working for federal, state or local government agencies. You can request a free
  government ticket here: https://forms. gle/aLNfRwpvFn3vQ5Vo8 Plus our regular program
  is amazing! All of that rests on top of our regular program that includes presentations
  like: Industry perspective: Scaling Cloud Native: Reaching the Next 10 Million Users
  by Lin Sun at Solo. io K8s in the Enterprise: From Silos to SIGs: Building Kubernetes
  Community in the Enterprise by Jason Stryker Inclusivity: Unleash Your Inner Ally:
  Let’s Make Open Source Radically Welcoming! by Catherine Paganini and Christopher
  Khanoyan advocate for inclusivity in open source.'
