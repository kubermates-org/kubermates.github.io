  About me Posted on December 9, 2025 by Akash Jaiswal CNCF projects highlighted in
  this post Attending OpenSearchCon, OpenSSF Day, and the Open Source Summit in Seoul
  was a truly memorable experience, especially because this was the first-ever Open
  Source Summit hosted in South Korea. I have previously attended two KubeCons in
  India including the Open Source Summit in Kubecon Hyderabad, but experiencing a
  Linux Foundation conference in another country offered a completely new perspective.
  Thanks to the Linux Foundation for sponsoring me to make this journey possible.
  The events were packed with insightful sessions. Here are a few of the most interesting
  talks I attended, focusing heavily on AI, Observability, and LLM performance. You
  can find the slides and recordings via the official event links and on YouTube.
  Keynote: Linus Torvalds (Creator of Linux & Git) in conversation with Dirk Hohndel
  (Head of the Open Source Program Office, Verizon) Link Tutorial: Building Custom
  MCP Servers With FastMCP and Integrating AI Agents Using Google ADK – Mehmet Hilmi
  Emel (Acedemand) Link Who Ate My Resources? Trace LLM Performance in Real Time With
  OTel – Aditya Soni (Forrester Research) & Seema Saharan (Autodesk) Beyond Keywords:
  Building an AI-Powered Search That Reads Your Mind – Prashant Agrawal (Amazon Web
  Services) From Telemetry to Insight: Building AI-Powered Observability Pipelines
  with OpenSearch – Neel Shah (Middleware) Link Standardizing the Unstandardized:
  Securing AI Supply Chain With Model-Spec and Kitops – Prasanth Baskar (8gears) Link

  2025 truly felt like the year of AI. As with much of the current tech landscape,
  there were countless talks and sessions centered around AI and its related technologies.
  Jung-Woo Ha delivered a keynote on AI that genuinely shifted how I think about the
  field. As the Senior Secretary to the President for AI and Future Planning in Korea,
  he offered a rare policymaker’s perspective on how countries are preparing for large-scale
  AI adoption, covering responsible AI, infrastructure readiness, and national research
  strategies. David Hirsch from Dynatrace talked about OSPOs, Open Source Program
  Offices and how enterprises govern open source at scale. Jay Lee from Microsoft
  shared insights into how they build and run on open source.'
