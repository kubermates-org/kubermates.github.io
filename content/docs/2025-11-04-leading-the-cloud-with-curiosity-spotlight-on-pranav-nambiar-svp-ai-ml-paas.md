  is no stranger to big tech, but what inspired him to join DigitalOcean was to be
  closer to the builders. He also wanted to work in a place where ideas move fast,
  people stay humble, and real breakthroughs happen. Today, he leads our AI/ML and
  PaaS portfolios with curiosity, empathy, and a belief that innovation should lift
  others up. “Having spent a lot of time in large companies, I was eager to experience
  a smaller, more agile company and broaden my horizons. DigitalOcean stood out for
  three main reasons: First , the fundamentals are incredibly strong. A company that
  moves from startup to IPO and now serves more than 640,000 customers—that’s an incredible
  achievement. It clearly signals strong fundamentals at DigitalOcean. Second , the
  opportunity to make a big impact is real. With generative AI transforming how innovation
  happens, and developers becoming the new drivers of change, DigitalOcean’s developer-first
  product heritage and simplified cloud focus position us to make massive waves. Last
  but not least , the culture is what brought me here. People build amazing products
  with a strong focus on simplicity and sophistication—this is what DigitalOcean is
  about. All of these combined made me feel this was the right place to join the journey
  and create a meaningful impact.'
