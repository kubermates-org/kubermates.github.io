  Robert Glenn The CNCF Cartografos Working Group is excited to announce the beta
  release of the Cloud Native Maturity Model 4.0. This version expands the framework
  to include AI, FinOps, and evolving cultural practices. We invite the community
  to review the model and help shape the final release. The Cloud Native Maturity
  Model (CNMM) was created to support you, whether you’re just beginning your cloud
  native journey, leading a team, or already an expert. It helps identify where you
  may need to invest in tools, processes, people, or policies. Most importantly, it
  connects technical goals to business outcomes, giving you a framework to communicate
  the value of cloud native strategy to leadership. Since its initial launch in 2021
  (with updates in 2022 and 2023), the model has helped organizations navigate adoption
  and maturity. Now, the Cartografos Working Group is excited to share the beta release
  of Version 4.0 —and we want your input. Key updates in CNMM 4.0 (Beta): Expanded
  focus on AI, emerging technologies, and FinOps Business-first maturity levels aligning
  outcomes with technical progress Shift-left approach to policy and governance Direct
  links to CNCF TAGs, working groups, and architectural references Cloud native has
  evolved rapidly, and CNMM 4.0 reflects those changes. This release expands coverage
  of AI, emerging technologies, and the cultural shifts required for success. It continues
  to emphasize that cloud native maturity must serve the business – not just technology
  for technology’s sake. Too often, conversations focus on Kubernetes or infrastructure
  in isolation.'
