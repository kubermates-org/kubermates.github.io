summary: Leveraging Katib for efficient RAG optimization. Feb 21, 2025 • Varsha Prasad
  Narsing (@varshaprasad96) • 7 min read katib As artificial intelligence and machine
  learning models become more sophisticated, optimising their performance remains
  a critical challenge. Kubeflow provides a robust component, Katib , designed for
  hyperparameter optimization and neural architecture search. As a part of the Kubeflow
  ecosystem, Katib enables scalable, automated tuning of underlying machine learning
  models, reducing the manual effort required for parameter selection while improving
  model performance across diverse ML workflows. With Retrieval-Augmented Generation
  ( RAG ) becoming an increasingly popular approach for improving search and retrieval
  quality, optimizing its parameters is essential to achieving high-quality results.
  RAG pipelines involve multiple hyperparameters that influence retrieval accuracy,
  hallucination reduction, and language generation quality. In this blog, we will
  explore how Katib can be leveraged to fine-tune a RAG pipeline, ensuring optimal
  performance by systematically adjusting key hyperparameters. Since compute resources
  are scarcer than a perfectly labeled dataset :), we’ll use a lightweight Kind cluster
  (Kubernetes in Docker) cluster to run this example locally. Rest assured, this setup
  can seamlessly scale to larger clusters by increasing the dataset size and the number
  of hyperparameters to tune. To get started, we’ll first install the Katib control
  plane in our cluster by following the steps outlined in the documentation. In this
  implementation, we use a retriever model , which encodes queries and documents into
  vector representations to find the most relevant matches, to fetch relevant documents
  based on a query and a generator model to produce coherent text responses. To run
  Katib, we will use the Katib SDK , which provides a programmatic interface for defining
  and running hyperparameter tuning experiments in Kubeflow.
