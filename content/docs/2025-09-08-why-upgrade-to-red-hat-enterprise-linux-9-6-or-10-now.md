  Virtualization Share My name is Gil Cattelain, and I''m a Product Marketing Manager
  here at Red Hat. I joined the company over four years ago, and I manage the Red
  Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) marketing releases and launches. You''ve likely read
  some of my blog posts, which I typically publish with every minor or major release,
  but this article highlights the importance of upgrading. If you''re still on RHEL
  6, RHEL 7, or even RHEL 8, then you should consider upgrading to RHEL 9.6 or a later
  version to take advantage of all the cool new features included in those versions.
  Why should you seriously consider upgrading to RHEL 9.6 or 10? That''s easy: To
  immediately leverage the groundbreaking technologies we''ve recently shipped. All
  new features included in RHEL 10 are also in RHEL 9.6, such as image mode and RHEL
  Lightspeed. While post-quantum cryptography isn''t yet in RHEL 9. x, it is planned
  for the upcoming RHEL 9.7 release. As you plan your upgrade from previous versions,
  make the leap to RHEL 9.6, RHEL 9.7, or even RHEL 10 to unlock these cutting-edge
  technologies! A significant new feature in both RHEL 9.6 and RHEL 10 is the RHEL
  Lightspeed command-line assistant. This powerful and optional AI assistant is directly
  integrated into the RHEL command-line interface, offering a revolutionary way to
  work. It can instantly and accurately answer RHEL-related questions, assist with
  troubleshooting to resolve issues faster, and easily decipher complex log entries,
  along with many other tasks to streamline daily operations. This command-line assistant
  provides a natural language interface, incorporating information from valuable resources
  like the RHEL documentation and release notes, thereby empowering organizations
  with an incredibly powerful tool for easier management, troubleshooting, and overall
  interaction with their RHEL systems.'
