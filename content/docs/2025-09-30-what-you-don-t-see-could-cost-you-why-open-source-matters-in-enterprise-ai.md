  Applications Virtualization Share In my previous article , I compared AI inference
  to the nervous system of an AI project — the critical, often unseen infrastructure
  that dictates the user experience. Whether it’s a chatbot or a complex application,
  the principle is the same: if the nervous system falters, everything else does too.
  As we know, however, a nervous system doesn''t operate in isolation. It relies on
  the rest of the body, with countless other systems working in harmony. Enterprise
  AI is fundamentally the same. Individual models, isolated infrastructure components,
  fragmented orchestration, or disconnected applications cannot deliver meaningful
  value on their own. Real impact only comes when these elements connect to form a
  cohesive, high-performing whole. There are many paths to AI adoption. Some begin
  with closed, so-called “black-box” systems: pre-packaged platforms that make it
  simple to get up and running. They can be a great entry point, but they also come
  with trade-offs. When you cannot see how a model was trained, it can be difficult
  to explain its behavior, address bias, or verify accuracy in your context. In fact,
  a 2025 IBM survey found that 45% of business leaders cite data accuracy or bias
  as their biggest obstacle to adopting AI.'
