  Virtualization Share IT automation is no longer optional for executives; it is a
  critical strategy. Organizations have moved beyond simple scripting to focus on
  speed and impact, using automation to power growth and reduce risk. But a critical
  gap remains: visibility. How do you, as a business leader, prove the return on investment
  (ROI) and confidently decide where to invest your next dollar? Red Hat Ansible Automation
  Platform''s automation dashboard and analytics feature is more than an IT report;
  it''s the financial and operational intelligence layer executives need to realize
  the full value of enterprise automation. Automation is a cost center until its value
  is quantifiable. The automation dashboard bridges that gap, converting technical
  wins—like time saved and job completion rates—into clear financial data. Demonstrate
  financial impact: No longer guess at ROI. The platform translates key metrics into
  reportable savings and ROI. This data enables clear reporting to leadership and
  key stakeholders, elevating automation from isolated IT tools into a mission-critical
  business asset. Prioritize with the savings planner: Looking ahead is equally as
  important as current reporting. The savings planner forecasts cost and time savings
  for potential tasks over the next 1 to 3 years. By prioritizing efforts that deliver
  maximum financial return, your automation roadmap can align with your business objectives.'
