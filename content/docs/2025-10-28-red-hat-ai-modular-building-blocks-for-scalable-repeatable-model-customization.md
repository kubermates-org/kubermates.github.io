  Automation Artificial intelligence Open hybrid cloud Security Edge computing Infrastructure
  Applications Virtualization Share Taking generative AI (gen AI) from experimentation
  to enterprise deployment is never one-size-fits-all. Healthcare, finance, manufacturing,
  and retail each have their own vocabularies, data quirks, and compliance challenges.
  These complexities can’t be addressed with generic workflows because real, business-critical
  deployments demand depth, control, and precision. Red Hat AI offers a model customization
  experience that builds on the success of InstructLab , evolving it into a modular
  architecture powered by Python libraries created by Red Hat. This approach preserves
  InstructLab’s core strengths—its open, extensible pipeline for fine-tuning and instruction-following—while
  enabling greater flexibility and scalability for enterprise environments. With this
  foundation, AI experts and ML practitioners can adapt methods, orchestrate pipelines,
  and scale model training without losing the agility to evolve as techniques improve.
  The result is a more sophisticated path to enterprise-grade model customization—one
  that delivers adaptability and control without sacrificing speed. At the heart of
  this evolution are 3 core components that enable experts to fine-tune models and
  integrate them effectively with retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). Docling for
  data processing SDG hub for synthetic data generation (SDG) Training hub for fine-tuning
  and continual learning Since these components are modular, you can use them independently
  or connect them end-to-end. We will also provide more supported notebooks and AI/data
  science pipelines that teach you the technology as well as how to adapt it to your
  use case, your data, your model, and run it reliably by combining data processing,
  synthetic data generation, and fine-tuning techniques. Docling is our supported
  solution for data processing. It’s the number one open source repository for document
  intelligence.'
