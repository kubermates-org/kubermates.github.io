tldr: Scheduling stateful applications reliably depends heavily on accurate information
  about resource availability on nodes.
summary: Scheduling stateful applications reliably depends heavily on accurate information
  about resource availability on nodes. Kubernetes v1. 33 introduces an alpha feature
  called mutable CSI node allocatable count , allowing Container Storage Interface
  (CSI) drivers to dynamically update the reported maximum number of volumes that
  a node can handle. This capability significantly enhances the accuracy of pod scheduling
  decisions and reduces scheduling failures caused by outdated volume capacity information.
  Traditionally, Kubernetes CSI drivers report a static maximum volume attachment
  limit when initializing. However, actual attachment capacities can change during
  a node's lifecycle for various...
