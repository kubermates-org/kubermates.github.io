  service providers face the challenge of maximizing return on investment (ROI) on
  massive 5G investments. Efficient infrastructure deployment is particularly difficult
  in areas with real-time demand fluctuations, such as stadiums and tourist spots.
  One key challenge lies in comprehending usage patterns and connectivity performance
  from the end-user''s perspective. A new paradigm is emerging: Customer and AI-driven
  network investments. This paradigm is being realized as a TM Forum catalyst project
  to build an AI-driven platform for network investments. Imagine every customer''s
  device acting as a real-time sensor for a service provider’s network. This is the
  promise of decentralized physical infrastructure networks (DePIN), an approach that
  puts customer experience at the center of every network decision. Red Hat, along
  with other industry leaders, are collaborating on this TM Forum catalyst project
  to develop a solution that combines the power of crowdsourced data with advanced
  analytics and artificial intelligence (AI) to deliver actionable insights. TM Forum
  is a global industry association that helps its members digitally transform through
  collaboration, innovation, and the development of standards and best practices.
  They provide resources like the open digital architecture , open APIs, and catalyst
  innovation programs to help members reduce costs, accelerate time-to-market, and
  deliver new services. The platform is built on three core pillars: User insights:
  With user consent, a lightweight application on customer devices collects quality-of-experience
  (QoE) and radio metrics to create a high-resolution, low-cost view of network performance.
  Following the DePIN approach, users are rewarded with on-chain tokens to create
  a transparent and verifiable incentive system.'
