  Virtualization Share A lot of teams we work with are juggling 2 worlds at once:
  the Red Hat OpenShift projects that keep accelerating, and the previous hypervisor
  platforms or physical infrastructure that need to be kept to run the traffic management
  and security policies of the BIG-IP appliances. This gets the job done, but nobody
  enjoys maintaining 2 sets of infrastructure with 2 different lifecycles. It’s a
  tax we all pay because there hasn’t been a clean alternative. Now there is. F5 BIG-IP
  Virtual Edition (VE) is officially validated by F5 to support Red Hat OpenShift
  Virtualization and listed in the Red Hat Ecosystem Catalog. With this milestone
  achievement, F5 provides further validation of customer demand for a hybrid container
  and virtualization platform. OpenShift Virtualization lets you run virtual machines
  (VMs) directly on your worker nodes. With the validation in place, BIG-IP VE can
  now be deployed among them, rather than requiring a separate environment you keep
  around solely for network appliances. Administrators can enjoy 1 control plane,
  1 lifecycle, 1 place to look when something needs patching. This isn’t a cut-down
  version or a feature-limited build. VE inside OpenShift is the very same BIG-IP.
  Your existing configs—WAF policies, iRules, routing decisions, all the customizations
  required for your applications—can be used as is.'
