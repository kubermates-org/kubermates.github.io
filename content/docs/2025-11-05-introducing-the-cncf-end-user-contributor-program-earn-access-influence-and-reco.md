summary: 'Program Transition: Retiring the End User Supporter Program Your Two Pathways
  to End User Engagement The Future is Bright for Contributors Who can join? How to
  apply Posted on November 5, 2025 by Eliza Power The cloud native ecosystem runs
  on the contributions from many sources– including vendors, developers, academics,
  and importantly, end users. The real-world production experience of end-user organizations
  is essential for project evolution and growth. If your organization is a CNCF End
  User and is contributing insights, code, case studies, demos, or feedback to the
  CNCF ecosystem, then this announcement is for you. We’re thrilled to announce the
  launch of the CNCF End User Contributor Program ; a zero-fees pathway for End Users
  to connect with our community, influence its technical direction, and earn public
  recognition. With this launch, we’re retiring the End User Support Program – and
  we want to thank every organization that participated for their valuable support.
  For Existing End User Supporters: To ensure a smooth transition, existing End User
  Supporters can renew for one more year under the existing program as long as their
  renewal term commences on or before January 1, 2026. But we won’t be accepting any
  new Supporters going forward. Going forward, End User organizations have two distinct,
  value-driven options for engagement. Both grant access to our End User community,
  but they differ in benefits: The End User Contributor Program is the free pathway
  to ensure your company remains connected to the heart of the CNCF End User community
  and its programs. As a qualified End User Contributor , your organization gains
  access to specialized events, programs, and privileges, including: Exclusive access
  to End User programs: Participate in initiatives and programs tailored specifically
  for cloud native end users. Attend End User-only events at KubeCon + CloudNativeCon:
  Connect with peers, project leaders, and CNCF leadership in dedicated sessions and
  networking events Participate in End User groups: Engage in focused discussions,
  share challenges, and collaborate on solutions with other End Users. Eligibility
  for the End User Technical Advisory Board (TAB): Run for and participate in the
  End User TAB, directly influencing CNCF’s technical vision and project oversight
  from an end-user perspective.'
