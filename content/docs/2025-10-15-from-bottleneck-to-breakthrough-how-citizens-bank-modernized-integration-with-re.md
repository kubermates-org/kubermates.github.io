  Virtualization Share Tikhnadhi Kamlakshya , vice president and manager of software
  engineering at Citizens Bank, saw a clear challenge: his team had a critical disconnect
  between their modern Salesforce platform and their legacy loan processing system,
  Black Knight. This gap created a significant bottleneck, hindering the bank''s ability
  to scale its mortgage operations and forcing loan officers to spend hours manually
  entering data. The main issue stemmed from communication difficulties between the
  2 essential systems they relied on for their tasks. On one side, there was the modern,
  agile Salesforce platform, the bank''s system for point of sale. On the other, the
  Black Knight system, a business-critical, legacy application that handled all loan
  processing and governance. The 2 systems couldn''t talk to each other, and with
  millions of records to process, the bank was facing a scalability crisis. "We were
  under enormous pressure," Kamlakshya recalls. "We had successfully migrated to Salesforce,
  but the job wasn''t finished. The fact that Salesforce couldn''t talk to our legacy
  system was a curveball we hadn''t anticipated. " The search for a solution The team
  at Citizens Bank explored several integration tools, but none could handle the scale
  and authentication requirements of the project. The team was running out of options,
  and the pressure was mounting. That''s when Kamlakshya and his team explored Red
  Hat OpenShift.'
