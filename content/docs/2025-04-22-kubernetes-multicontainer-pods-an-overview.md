summary: As cloud-native architectures continue to evolve, Kubernetes has become the
  go-to platform for deploying complex, distributed systems. One of the most powerful
  yet nuanced design patterns in this ecosystem is the sidecar pattern—a technique
  that allows developers to extend application functionality without diving deep into
  source code. Think of a sidecar like a trusty companion motorcycle attachment. Historically,
  IT infrastructures have always used auxiliary services to handle critical tasks.
  Before containers, we relied on background processes and helper daemons to manage
  logging, monitoring, and networking. The microservices revolution transformed this
  approach, making sidecars a structured and intentional architectural choice. With
  the rise of microservices, the sidecar pattern became more clearly defined, allowing
  developers to offload specific responsibilities from the main service without altering
  its code. Service meshes like Istio and Linkerd have popularized sidecar proxies,
  demonstrating how these companion containers can elegantly handle observability,
  security, and traffic management in distributed systems. In Kubernetes, sidecar
  containers operate within the same Pod as the main application, enabling communication
  and resource sharing. Does this sound just like defining multiple containers along
  each other inside the Pod? It actually does, and this is how sidecar containers
  had to be implemented before Kubernetes v1. 29. 0, which introduced native support
  for sidecars.
