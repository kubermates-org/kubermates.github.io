  NGINX Controller, the trusty staple of countless platform engineering toolkits,
  is about to be put out to pasture. This news was announced by the Kubernetes community
  recently, and very quickly circulated throughout the cloud-native space. It’s big
  news for any platform team that currently uses the NGINX Controller because, as
  of March 26, 2026, there will be no more bug fixes, no more critical vulnerability
  patches and no more enhancements when Kubernetes continues to release new versions.
  If you’re feeling ambushed, you’re not alone. For many teams, this isn’t just an
  inconvenient roadmap update, its unexpected news that now puts long-term traffic
  management decisions front and center. You know you need to migrate yesterday but
  the best path forward can be a confusing labyrinth of platforms and unfamiliar tools.
  Questions you might ask yourself: ❓Do you find a quick drop-in Ingress replacement?
  ❓Does moving to Gateway API make sense and can you commit enough resources to do
  a full migration? ❓If you decide on Gateway API then what is the best option for
  a smooth transition? With Ingress NGINX on the way out, platform teams are standing
  at a familiar but uncomfortable moment: deciding whether to stick with what works
  today or invest in what will carry them forward tomorrow. Ingress API continues
  to serve as a solid and reliable solution for straightforward routing needs. Gateway
  API builds on that foundation with a more expressive, extensible, and standardized
  model suited for modern production environments. To understand what’s really at
  stake, it helps to look beyond the headlines and compare what Ingress and Gateway
  API actually offer in practice. The chart below shows how the two compare across
  key features. Ingress API (Basic): Ideal for simpler, smaller applications or teams
  that don’t need advanced traffic management or cross-namespace operations.'
