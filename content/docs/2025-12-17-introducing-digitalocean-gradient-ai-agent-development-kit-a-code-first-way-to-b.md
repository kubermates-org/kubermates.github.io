  17, 2025 3 min read Developers everywhere face a common challenge: it’s getting
  easier and easier to prototype an AI agent, but harder to turn that prototype into
  something reliable, testable, and ready for production. Orchestrating LLM interactions,
  managing state, wiring up function calling, integrating multiple tools, evaluating
  performance, tracing failures, and deploying to production often require complex
  custom code and scattered tooling. The DigitalOcean Gradient™ AI Agent Development
  Kit (ADK) , now available in public preview , is designed to solve exactly that
  problem. It’s a powerful, code-first SDK that lets you build, test, and deploy sophisticated
  multi-step agent workflows from within their existing development environments,
  with built-in support for evaluations, traceability, and knowledge bases. To see
  the ADK in action and for help getting started, check out our tutorial. Most AI
  frameworks solve the “day-one” problem: how to create a working agent. But they
  fall short on the “day-two” problem: how to operate that agent in production. We
  built the ADK to give you a standardized, production-grade framework that handles
  the full lifecycle: Orchestration: Build multi-step workflows without boilerplate
  State management: Keep track of what your agent is doing across steps Tool integration:
  Register custom functions/APIs as first-class tools Knowledge base support: Connect
  agents to your existing DO Knowledge Bases Evaluations: Measure correctness, security,
  tone, and retrieval quality Tracing: Understand how your agent behaves at every
  span and step Deployment: Ship your entire agent system, from logic to KBs to tools,
  with one command The result is a code-first experience that lets you move from local
  development → observability → evaluation → deployment in a single, consistent workflow.
  Our goal is to provide a strong foundation for developers to build, test, and deploy
  AI agent workflows directly from their development environment. In the private preview,
  you could leverage the core SDK framework with CRUD APIs, connect models, organize
  projects in workspaces, use the entry point decorator and CLI, and take advantage
  of MCP support on the Agent Platform. Building on this foundation, the public preview
  introduces a set of powerful new features to help you run production-level workflows
  more efficiently and with deeper visibility: Traces & Insights for Any Workflow
  : Add full tracing to your agent logic using custom decorators, even without LangGraph.
  Spans, steps, and KB interactions appear in the Gradient AI Platform UI, helping
  you understand your agent’s behavior at every step.'
