  Applications Virtualization Share You''re tasked with bringing AI into your organization,
  but the journey from a proof-of-concept to a production-ready application is often
  a maze of fragmented tools and complex integrations, especially for agentic AI use
  cases. The real challenge isn''t just the technology—it''s building an AI strategy
  that is scalable, reliable, and manageable. Standardization is a primary factor
  in meeting this challenge, primarily by reducing complexity and increasing efficiency.
  By combining Model Context Protocol (MCP) and Llama Stack on a platform like Red
  Hat OpenShift AI , you can create a unified and portable environment for your AI
  applications. OpenShift AI can also support the integration of any other agentic
  frameworks and components you like, including tools like LangChain, LangGraph, and
  CrewAI, among others. Red Hat''s approach can help simplify development, streamline
  operations, and give your enterprise the tools it needs to empower your multiple
  teams, like AI developers and data scientists to turn your AI vision into a reality
  within a trusted and consistent environment. To build resilient AI-enabled applications,
  you need a foundation that enables intelligent agents to access and use your enterprise''s
  specific tools and data. This requires 2 key components: a standardized way to expose
  your services and a unified framework for interacting with them. This is the essence
  of agentic AI , where an autonomous system can determine the best course of action
  and tools needed to achieve a goal. The combination of MCP and Llama Stack provides
  the framework for these agents to operate effectively. MCP is an open protocol that
  standardizes how your AI systems integrate with external tools and data sources.
  It has been described as being a "USB-C port for AI applications.'
