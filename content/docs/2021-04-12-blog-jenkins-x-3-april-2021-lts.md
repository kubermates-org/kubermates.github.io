summary: 'Jenkins X 3 - April 2021 LTS This is the second LTS release for Jenkins
  X 3. x. LTS is a slower cadence version stream which contains a verified set of
  releases and configurations that have been used by teams tracking the bleeding edge
  Jenkins X. Initially when we decided to maintain an LTS version stream we thought
  we’d aim for monthly releases however this second release comes two months after
  the first. This has given us more chances to run fixes and chart upgrades on Jenkins
  X own infrastructure to verify stability. Note This LTS release is intended to be
  the final one before Jenkins X 3 is made Generally Available so stay tuned for the
  exciting news coming very soon! We will of course continue to develop and release
  LTS post GA. Included in this release: General beta bug fixes and helm chart upgrades
  Enable Observability Enable Slack notifications Support for GitLab, Gitea, BitBucket
  Server and GitHub Enterprise Please be aware of these changes Breaking changes If
  using Vault move it outside of being managed by Jenkins X GitOps important notes
