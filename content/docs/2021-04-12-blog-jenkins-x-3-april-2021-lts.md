tldr: This is the second LTS release for Jenkins X 3. x.
summary: 'This is the second LTS release for Jenkins X 3. x. LTS is a slower cadence
  version stream which contains a verified set of releases and configurations that
  have been used by teams tracking the bleeding edge Jenkins X. Initially when we
  decided to maintain an LTS version stream we thought we’d aim for monthly releases
  however this second release comes two months after the first. This has given us
  more chances to run fixes and chart upgrades on Jenkins X own infrastructure to
  verify stability. Note This LTS release is intended to be the final one before Jenkins
  X 3 is made Generally Available so stay tuned for the exciting news coming very
  soon! We will of course continue to develop and release LTS post GA. Included in
  this release: Please be aware of these changes.'
