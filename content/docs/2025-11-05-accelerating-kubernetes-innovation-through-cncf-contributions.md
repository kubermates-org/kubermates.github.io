  Innovation through CNCF Contributions Analyst Insight Series: Security and Collaboration—Core
  Tenets of Successful Platform Engineering Open-source forms the foundation of modern
  cloud infrastructure, driving key innovations across the industry. At Broadcom,
  we are not just consumers of open-source projects, we are active contributors and
  maintainers helping shape CNCF initiatives. Our engineers help address complex operational
  challenges through direct upstream contributions that make Kubernetes more reliable,
  scalable, and secure. Broadcom has long been one of the top five contributors 1
  to CNCF projects, demonstrating not just participation but genuine leadership in
  the open-source ecosystem. This isn’t about using open source simply as a consumer
  but rather strengthening it as a shared foundation for innovation, a practice we
  uphold across all projects shown in Figure 1. Broadcom’s sustained investment and
  contributions reflect deep trust in community-driven progress, where collaboration
  and transparency ultimately serve customers, partners, and the broader industry.
  Figure 1: Fostering Innovation through Collaboration Challenges for customers By
  2029, more than 95% of global organizations will be running containerized applications
  in production, up from less than 50% in 2023 2. Kubernetes has played a key role
  as the container orchestration system with adoption at 80% according to a survey
  conducted by CNCF in 2024 3. In the same survey, 46% of the respondents indicated
  that open-source projects, including Kubernetes itself, are difficult to understand
  or run while an equal percentage expressed concerns about the longevity of these
  projects, and 29% of respondents expressed concerns about security vulnerabilities.
  While Kubernetes is incredibly powerful and a standard for modern infrastructure,
  it is also inherently complex. Kubernetes requires integration with dozens of separate
  tools to achieve enterprise-grade security, compliance, lifecycle management, and
  consistent operations at scale. Customers are responsible for integrating and operating
  a complex ecosystem securely and consistently.'
