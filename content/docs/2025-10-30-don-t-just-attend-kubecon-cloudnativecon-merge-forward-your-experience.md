  Forward team will be at KubeCon + CloudNativeCon Atlanta this year. If you part
  of an underrepresented group, an ally, or just love meeting people from all walks
  of life, then be sure to add these Merge Forward sessions to your calendar. It will
  be fun, diverse, and inclusive, with many opportunities to connect with peers and
  make new KubeCon + CloudNativeCon friends. Since there’s a lot going on, we’ve put
  together this Merge Forward Community Guide to KubeCon + CloudNativeCon so you don’t
  miss any of our great diversity and inclusion activities and sessions. Launched
  just two months ago, Merge Forward is all about fostering a more inclusive and welcoming
  cloud native community. It is the new home to new and old community groups such
  as the Deaf and Hard of Hearing WG, Women in Cloud Native, Neurodiversity, and many
  more. If you haven’t done so yet, learn more about our mission and how to join our
  growing community on the Merge Forward Community page. KubeCon + CloudNativeCon
  is more than just sessions. It’s a great opportunity to connect with like-minded
  peers and allies. Below you’ll find some opportunities to build your network, learn
  about accessibility, attend Merge Forward community member talks, and make new friends.
  The Community Hub is a dedicated space for people from diverse backgrounds and their
  allies. Swing by to meet your peers, expand your professional network, and learn
  from shared experiences.'
