summary: Kubernetes is a container orchestration tool used to deploy and manage containerized
  applications. Like any software, these applications can sometimes fail or not perform
  as expected due to various reasons. When such failures occur, it’s important to
  identify and rectify the issue quickly. One key aspect of troubleshooting involves
  analyzing the application logs, which can provide valuable information about the
  root cause of the problem. Logs are essentially records of events happening within
  your application. By examining these logs, we can often gain insights into what
  went wrong. In this blog post, we’ll learn how to access Pod logs in Kubernetes
  using the kubectl logs command. Note that when we say Pod logs, we’re generally
  referring to the logs of the applications running in containers inside the Pod.
  To easily follow along with the examples in this post, we recommend using KodeKloud’s
  Kubernetes playground. This playground will provide you instant access to a running
  Kubernetes cluster with kubectl already installed. No need for you to install any
  software. With just one click, you'll be ready to run the example code snippets
  and start experimenting right away.
