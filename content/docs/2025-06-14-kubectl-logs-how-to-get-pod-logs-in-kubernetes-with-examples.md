  Learning DevOps? What Is Kubernetes? Finally, a Simple Explanation! Like any software,
  these applications can sometimes fail or not perform as expected due to various
  reasons. When such failures occur, it’s important to identify and rectify the issue
  quickly. One key aspect of troubleshooting involves analyzing the application logs,
  which can provide valuable information about the root cause of the problem. Logs
  are essentially records of events happening within your application. By examining
  these logs, we can often gain insights into what went wrong. In this blog post,
  we’ll learn how to access Pod logs in Kubernetes using the kubectl logs command.
  Note that when we say Pod logs, we’re generally referring to the logs of the applications
  running in containers inside the Pod. kubectl logs To easily follow along with the
  examples in this post, we recommend using KodeKloud’s Kubernetes playground. This
  playground will provide you instant access to a running Kubernetes cluster with
  kubectl already installed. No need for you to install any software. With just one
  click, you''ll be ready to run the example code snippets and start experimenting
  right away. kubectl Alternatively, if you prefer to set up your own Kubernetes cluster,
  you can use a tool such as minikube.'
