  CEL What is Kyverno? Evolving Challenges and the Rise of CEL Introducing New Policy
  Types in Kyverno 1. 14 Validating Policy Image Validating Policy Future Directions
  Kyverno’s Strengths Recently, Cloud Native Live featured a session diving into the
  powerful integration of Common Expression Language (CEL) in Kyverno 1. 14. Hosted
  by Eric Durmishi and presented by Kyverno maintainers Mariam Fahmy and Charles Edward,
  the session introduced exciting new capabilities that enhance Kyverno’s flexibility
  and consistency as a policy engine for Kubernetes. At its core, Kyverno is a policy
  engine for Kubernetes. It enables you to define policies for validating, mutating,
  generating, or verifying images for resources within your cluster. When an API request,
  like creating a Pod, is sent to the Kubernetes API server, it passes through several
  stages, including authentication and authorization. Kyverno integrates as an admission
  webhook. The API request is forwarded to the Kyverno server, which fetches relevant
  policies, applies them to the resource, and then either accepts or rejects the request
  based on whether the resource violates the policy. Kyverno also includes components
  such as the Reports Controller, which generates policy reports to visualize policy
  results, and a Cleanup Controller, which manages unused resources based on cleanup
  policies. Traditionally, Kyverno used a single policy type with different rule types
  nested within it, such as validate, mutate, generate, and verifyImages.'
