summary: On September 26, 2023, the first day of KubeCon + CloudNativeCon + Open Source
  Summit China 2023 , nearly 50 contributors gathered in Shanghai for the Kubernetes
  Contributor Summit. All participants in the 2023 Kubernetes Contributor Summit This
  marked the first in-person offline gathering held in China after three years of
  the pandemic. The event began with welcome speeches from Kevin Wang from Huawei
  Cloud, one of the co-chairs of KubeCon, and Puja from Giant Swarm. Following the
  opening remarks, the contributors introduced themselves briefly. Most attendees
  were from China, while some contributors had made the journey from Europe and the
  United States specifically for the conference. Technical experts from companies
  such as Microsoft, Intel, Huawei, as well as emerging forces like DaoCloud, were
  present. Laughter and cheerful voices filled the room, regardless of whether English
  was spoken with European or American accents or if conversations were carried out
  in authentic Chinese language. This created an atmosphere of comfort, joy, respect,
  and anticipation. Past contributions brought everyone closer, and mutual recognition
  and accomplishments made this offline gathering possible. Face to face meeting in
  Shanghai The attending contributors were no longer just GitHub IDs; they transformed
  into vivid faces. From sitting together and capturing group photos to attempting
  to identify “Who is who,” a loosely connected collective emerged. This team structure,
  although loosely knit and free-spirited, was established to pursue shared dreams.
