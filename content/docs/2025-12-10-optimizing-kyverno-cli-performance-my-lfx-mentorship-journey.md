  While exploring CNCF Projects in early 2025, I stumbled upon Kyverno and its community
  impressed me. The mentors and community members encouraged me to become a part of
  LFX Mentorship and motivated me to help new people start their open source journey.
  What started as a curiosity quickly became a meaningful journey into open source
  contribution. Kyverno is a cloud-native policy engine that runs in a Kubernetes
  cluster. It enforces best practices for security and compliance for platforms and
  applications through policies as code. Kyverno operates as a dynamic admission controller
  to mutate, validate, or generate resources based on policy rules. The LFX mentorship
  is a 12-week long program that provides mentees with guidance and support to get
  involved in open source projects. The project maintainers provide students with
  the opportunity to learn while gaining real-world experience by contributing to
  community-driven projects. The program runs three times a year during Spring, Summer
  and Fall. Once I learnt about the LFX mentorship, I applied through the official
  process. After a few weeks of contributing, I got familiar with Kyverno’s codebase,
  community, and maintainers. I realised Kyverno’s project was the best fit for me.
