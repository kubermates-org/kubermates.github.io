  rising geopolitical tensions, digital sovereignty has become a focal point for governments
  and enterprises alike. However, for defence organisations, sovereignty alone is
  not enough. The ability to maintain operational resilience in the face of conflict
  or severe geopolitical disruption requires the capacity to act independently when
  cooperation is impossible. Only true autonomy can provide that ability. Digital
  sovereignty , whether cloud, data, or total sovereignty, refers to control over
  digital assets, so data, hardware, people, and software remain within a specific
  jurisdiction. While sovereignty addresses regulatory and jurisdictional concerns,
  it does not guarantee operational continuity in crisis scenarios. Strategic autonomy,
  however, goes further. It means maintaining the ability to collaborate with international
  partners when possible, while retaining the independence to operate alone when necessary.
  For defence organisations, this is a matter of mission survival. In peacetime, reliance
  on hyperscale cloud providers and distributed IT infrastructure is manageable. But
  in conflict, the landscape shifts dramatically. Physical destruction can render
  data centres inoperable, while internet outages cripple cloud-dependent operations.
