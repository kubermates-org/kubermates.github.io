  Security Edge computing Infrastructure Applications Virtualization Share In today's
  modern technological world, IT infrastructure must deliver uncompromising speed
  and reliability to meet the critical demands of the business. Centralized automated
  platforms, such as Red Hat Ansible Automation Platform , are essential for managing
  critical IT infrastructure. These platforms streamline operations and increase efficiency
  by standardizing and scaling automation across the entire organization, transforming
  complex, repetitive tasks into a governed, security-focused, and repeatable enterprise
  strategy. The platform’s fundamental value lies in its resilience. For mission-critical
  automation, a resilient foundation is not merely a best practice—it’s essential.
  High Availability (HA) at the database layer serves as a critical safety net, protecting
  automation processes from interruption. This resilient environment moves beyond
  basic uptime to deliver the continuous availability required for the database, supporting
  your entire automation strategy. With this in mind, Red Hat is collaborating with
  EDB to deliver a more resilient enterprise automation solution. Customers can now
  officially deploy production-ready EDB PostgreSQL clusters with enterprise-grade
  HA and failover capabilities for Ansible Automation Platform. This collaboration
  provides continuous Postgres availability to your automation platform, focusing
  on the database layer. The solution integrates core EDB Postgres AI capabilities
  with Ansible Automation Platform, delivering a fully tested, validated, and reliable
  foundation for your mission-critical automation. This approach gives you a production-ready
  PostgreSQL backend, making your database ready to support continuous operations.
