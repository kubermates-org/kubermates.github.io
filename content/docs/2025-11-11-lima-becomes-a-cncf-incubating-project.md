  Lima’s Beginnings and Growth Maintainer Perspective From the TOC Main Components:
  Notable Milestones Latest release Posted on November 11, 2025 by Lima Project Maintainers
  CNCF projects highlighted in this post The CNCF Technical Oversight Committee (TOC)
  has voted to accept Lima as a CNCF incubating project. Lima enables secure, isolated
  environments for running cloud native and AI workloads. Lima, short for “Linux Machines,”
  provides Linux virtual machines optimized for running containers in local development
  environments. Lima comes with built-in integration for the following container engines
  : containerd [CNCF Graduated] (default) Docker Podman [CNCF Sandbox] Kubernetes
  [CNCF Graduated] k3s [CNCF Sandbox] k0s [CNCF Sandbox] Usernetes RKE2 k3s [CNCF
  Sandbox] k0s [CNCF Sandbox] Usernetes RKE2 Apptainer Lima is also known to be useful
  for a variety of other use cases beyond containerization. One of the most edgy use
  cases is to run an AI coding agent inside a VM in order to isolate the agent from
  direct access to host files and commands. This setup ensures that even if an AI
  agent is deceived by malicious instructions searched from the Internet (e. g. ,
  fake package installations), any potential damage is confined within the VM or limited
  to files specified to be mounted from the host. The Lima website features several
  examples of hardening AI agents: Aider Claude Code Codex Gemini GitHub Copilot CLI
  GitHub Copilot in Visual Studio Code The Lima project was launched in May 2021 by
  Akihiro Suda, a maintainer of containerd and numerous other projects in the container
  ecosystem. The project was initially designed as a “containerd machine” aiming to
  demonstrate and promote containerd, including nerdctl (contaiNERD CTL), to Mac users.
  Later the project scope was expanded to support other container engines and non-container
  applications as well. Lima supports non-macOS hosts, such as Linux, NetBSD, and
  Windows.'
