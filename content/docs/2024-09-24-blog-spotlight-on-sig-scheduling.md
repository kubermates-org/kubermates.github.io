  we talked with Kensei Nakada , an approver in SIG Scheduling. Arvind: Hello, thank
  you for the opportunity to learn more about SIG Scheduling! Would you like to introduce
  yourself and tell us a bit about your role, and how you got involved with Kubernetes?

  we talked with Kensei Nakada , an approver in SIG Scheduling. Arvind: Hello, thank
  you for the opportunity to learn more about SIG Scheduling! Would you like to introduce
  yourself and tell us a bit about your role, and how you got involved with Kubernetes?
  Kensei : Hi, thanks for the opportunity! I’m Kensei Nakada ( @sanposhiho ), a software
  engineer at Tetrate. io. I have been contributing to Kubernetes in my free time
  for more than 3 years, and now I’m an approver of SIG Scheduling in Kubernetes.
  Also, I’m a founder/owner of two SIG subprojects, kube-scheduler-simulator and kube-scheduler-wasm-extension.
  AP: That’s awesome! You’ve been involved with the project since a long time. Can
  you provide a brief overview of SIG Scheduling and explain its role within the Kubernetes
  ecosystem? KN : As the name implies, our responsibility is to enhance scheduling
  within Kubernetes. Specifically, we develop the components that determine which
  Node is the best place for each Pod. In Kubernetes, our main focus is on maintaining
  the kube-scheduler , along with other scheduling-related components as part of our
  SIG subprojects. That makes me curious–what recent innovations or developments has
  SIG Scheduling introduced to Kubernetes scheduling? KN : From a feature perspective,
  there have been several enhancements to PodTopologySpread recently. PodTopologySpread
  is a relatively new feature in the scheduler, and we are still in the process of
  gathering feedback and making improvements. PodTopologySpread PodTopologySpread
  Most recently, we have been focusing on a new internal enhancement called QueueingHint
  which aims to enhance scheduling throughput.'
