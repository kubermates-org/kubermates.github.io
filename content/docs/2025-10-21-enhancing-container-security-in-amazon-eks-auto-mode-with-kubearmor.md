  authors This post was written with Rahul Jadhav from Accuknox. As organizations
  adopt Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (Amazon EKS) Auto Mode for its streamlined
  Kubernetes cluster management, security remains a shared responsibility. Although
  EKS Auto Mode automates control plane operations, container runtime security needs
  more attention. In this post, we explore how KubeArmor , an open source container-aware
  security enforcement system, enhances the security posture of containerized workloads
  running on EKS Auto Mode clusters. Although EKS Auto Mode significantly streamlines
  cluster management by automating control plane and node operations, securing the
  workloads running within the cluster remains a critical user responsibility. Traditional
  security tools often struggle to provide granular visibility and control at the
  container runtime level, leaving potential gaps for sophisticated attacks. Container
  runtime security presents unique challenges that traditional security approaches
  don’t fully address.'
