  From the TOC Looking Ahead Posted on November 11, 2025 by KServe Project Maintainers
  CNCF projects highlighted in this post The CNCF Technical Oversight Committee (TOC)
  has voted to accept KServe as a CNCF incubating project. KServe joins a growing
  ecosystem of technologies tackling real-world challenges at the edge of cloud native
  infrastructure. KServe is a standardized distributed generative and predictive AI
  inference platform for scalable, multi-framework deployment on Kubernetes. It is
  designed as a single, unified platform for both generative and predictive AI inference
  on Kubernetes. While simple enough for quick deployments, KServe is powerful enough
  to handle enterprise-scale AI workloads with advanced features. KServe originated
  in 2019 as a collaborative effort by Google, IBM, Bloomberg, NVIDIA, and Seldon
  under the Kubeflow project. It was later donated to the LF AI & Data Foundation
  in February 2022. In September 2022, the project rebranded from KFServing to the
  standalone KServe, graduating from Kubeflow. KServe then moved to CNCF as an incubator
  in September 2025. KServe has demonstrated consistent and growing adoption across
  diverse industries and geographies, with production deployments ranging from large-scale
  multi-cloud enterprise platforms to specialized internal AI infrastructure. The
  project is used by major organizations, including Bloomberg, Red Hat, Cloudera,
  CyberAgent, Nutanix, SAP, NVIDIA, and others, spanning sectors such as enterprise
  software, cloud infrastructure, online media, gaming, and financial services. Deployments
  support both generative and predictive AI workloads at scale.
