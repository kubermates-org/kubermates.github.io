summary: 'Kubernetes 1.22 - Breaking change! To allow Jenkins X to support Kubernetes
  1.22, we had to update our version of Tekton. This updated version of Tekton contains
  breaking changes that has consequences if you made your own custom Jenkins X pipelines.
  To make sure that your custom pipelines continue to work after this upgrade, you
  must edit the resource settings in your pipelines. Otherwise your pipelines will
  most likely not be able to start at all, or if they do, consume a lot of resources.
  Tekton made changes in how to calculate the resources needed to run a pipeline,
  in order to support the concept of LimitRange in Kubernetes (introduced in Kubernetes
  version 1.10). Previously, Tekton simply used the maximum requested cpu and memory
  of any single step, and set that as limits for the all steps in the pipeline. For
  more details, please read the Tekton documentation on LimitRange. In the Tekton
  pipeline files, the StepTemplate needs to be changed to not specify resource requests
  , but only setting an empty resource limits : requests limits stepTemplate : image

  name : "" resources : # override limits for all containers here limits : {} The
  resource requests should be set on only one individual step: requests steps : -

  your custom pipelines you may investigate this PR on The Jenkins X pipeline catalog.'
