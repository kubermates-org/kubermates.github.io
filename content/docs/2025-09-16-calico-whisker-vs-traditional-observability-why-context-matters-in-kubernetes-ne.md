summary: 'What is Calico Whisker? How Does It Work? What Makes Calico Whisker Different?
  Practical Examples: Calico Whisker in Action Scenario 1: Safely Rolling Out a New
  Network Policy Scenario 2: Uncovering Hidden Security Risks How to Get Started with
  Calico Whisker Are you tired of digging through cryptic logs to understand your
  Kubernetes network? In today’s fast-paced cloud environments, clear, real-time visibility
  isn’t a luxury, it’s a necessity. Traditional logging and metrics often fall short,
  leaving you without the context needed to troubleshoot effectively. That’s precisely
  what Calico Whisker’s recent launch (with Calico v3.30) aims to solve. This tool
  provides clarity where logs alone fall short. In the sections below, you’ll get
  a practical overview of how it works and how it fits into modern Kubernetes networking
  and security workflows. If you’re relying on logs for network observability, you’re
  not alone. While this approach can provide some insights, it’s often a manual, resource-intensive
  process that puts significant load on your distributed systems. It’s simply not
  a cloud-native solution for real-time insights. So are we doomed? No. Calico Whisker
  transforms network observability from a chore into a superpower. Calico Whisker
  is a free, lightweight, Kubernetes-native observability user interface (UI) created
  by Tigera and introduced with Calico Open Source v3.30. It’s designed to give you
  a simple yet powerful window into your cluster’s network traffic, helping you understand
  network flows and evaluate policy behavior in real-time.'
