  Share The migration toolkit for virtualization 2.10 (MTV) is now generally available
  and expands on capabilities introduced in the recent release to better support your
  virtual machine (VM) migration journey with minimal downtime and reduced risk. With
  updates to storage offloading, your organization can efficiently plan and execute
  your VM migrations with MTV 2.10. Speed is a critical component of a VM migration.
  Storage offloading is now available in Technology Preview in MTV 2.10. For large-scale
  migrations, network bandwidth is often a primary bottleneck. Storage offloading
  eliminates this constraint by leveraging the power of existing storage arrays to
  manage the data transfer. Instead of pushing data over the network, MTV''s plug-in
  module coordinates with the storage provider to move VM disk data directly over
  the storage system. This results in significantly faster migrations, reduced downtime,
  and greater reliability. Learn more about storage offloading. Warm migrations are
  now supported in Developer Preview: Previously limited to cold migrations (in Technology
  Preview), MTV 2.10 now supports storage offloading with warm migrations. You can
  keep critical VMs running while data is migrated quickly and safely, with minimal
  downtime during the cutover. Please verify with your account team if this option
  makes sense for your migration plan.'
