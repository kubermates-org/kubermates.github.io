tldr: For more information on the Jenkins X survey see Survey results Some highlights
  from the free text answers. run it against a local running cluster to test changes
  to Jenkins-X before updated in GitHub.
summary: For more information on the Jenkins X survey see Survey results Some highlights
  from the free text answers. run it against a local running cluster to test changes
  to Jenkins-X before updated in GitHub. Integration with on-premise (Gitlab) as a
  lot of organizations are not using public cloud due to security policies, Proper
  guide on installing into existing cluster without using terraform. Give us back
  something like jx compliance , jx boot. Would be nice to not be tied to terraform
  to boot jenkins-x. Just like kubernetes, it would be great to have a jenkins-x the
  hard way where everything needs to be installed manually. it’s very difficult to
  just dive in without previous knowledge of the system extreme lack of quality documentation.
  Many conversations take place in slack and users cannot find information that somebody
  had the same problem beforehand and how it was solved More documentation and guides,
  making sure quickstart guides work without hassle Making it easier to get started
  Very hard to find any information on how people solve a similar problem before I
  very much enjoy your documentation, but it is very hard to find anything on google
  that is a huge disadvantage. Documents need to be clear about what works, and what
  does not work (kubernetes versions for example, bitbucket etc. ) Could also be nice
  with an arcitecture illustration or video that could compare jenkins with jenkins
  X I find that when I’m looking for information I get a lot of mixed results (v3
  vs v2). Integration with vault is confused. Why install vault in docker in k3s environment?
  I strongly believe in this project! I use Jenkins X as a learning tool.
