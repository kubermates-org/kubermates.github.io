  are exciting times for AI. Enterprises are blending AI capabilities with enterprise
  data to deliver better outcomes for employees, customers, and partners. But as organizations
  weave AI deeper into their systems, that data and infrastructure also become more
  attractive targets for cybercriminals and other adversaries. Generative AI (gen
  AI), in particular, introduces new risks by significantly expanding an organization’s
  attack surface. That means enterprises must carefully evaluate potential threats,
  vulnerabilities, and the risks they bring to business operations. Deploying AI with
  a strong security posture, in compliance with regulations, and in a way that is
  more trustworthy requires more than patchwork defenses, it demands a strategic shift.
  Security can’t be an afterthought—it must be built into the entire AI strategy.
  AI security and AI safety are related but distinct concepts. Both are necessary
  to reduce risk, but they address different challenges. AI security focuses on protecting
  the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of AI systems. The goal is to prevent
  malicious actors from attacking or manipulating those systems.'
