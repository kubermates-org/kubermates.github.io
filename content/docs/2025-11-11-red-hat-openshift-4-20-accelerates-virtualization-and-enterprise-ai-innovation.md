  Share Red Hat OpenShift 4.20 is now generally available. It's based on Kubernetes
  1.33 and CRI-O 1.33 and, together with Red Hat OpenShift Platform Plus , this release
  underscores our commitment to provide a trusted, comprehensive, and consistent application
  platform. On OpenShift, AI workloads, containers, and virtualization seamlessly
  co-exist, enabling enterprises to innovate faster across the hybrid cloud, without
  compromising on security. Available in self-managed or fully managed cloud service
  editions, OpenShift offers an application platform with a complete set of integrated
  tools and services for cloud-native, AI, virtual and traditional workloads alike.
  This article highlights the latest OpenShift 4.20 innovations and key enhancements.
  For a comprehensive list of updates and improvements, refer to the OpenShift 4.20
  release notes. This latest release boosts the platform’s capabilities for AI workloads
  with the general availability of LeaderWorkerSet , Gateway API inference extension,
  and runtime Open Container Initiative (OCI) image volume source. It also strengthens
  core functionalities, introducing vital improvements like bring-your-own external
  identity provider, Zero Trust Workload Identity Manager, user namespace, External
  Secrets Operator for Red Hat OpenShift , Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) support.
  Furthermore, OpenShift 4.20 brings key advancements in virtualization, such as CPU
  load aware rebalancing and faster live migration, providing a more robust and versatile
  platform for diverse computing needs. OpenShift 4.20 now enables the X25519MLKEM768
  hybrid key exchange mechanism with the Go 1.24 release as part of our journey to
  add support for post-quantum cryptography (PQC). This enhances TLS communications
  between core Kubernetes control plane components like the API server, kubelet, scheduler,
  and controller-manager, helping protect them from quantum-based attacks. Red Hat's
  latest releases of Trusted Artifact Signer 1.3 and Trusted Profile Analyzer 2.2
  deliver a powerful combination of cryptographic signing capabilities and advanced
  supply chain analysis.
