  \ learning (ML) or a seasoned expert, looking to train a large language model (LLM)\
  \ or run cost-effective inference, DigitalOcean has a GPU Droplet for you. We currently\
  \ offer seven different GPU Droplet types from industry-leading brands - AMD and\
  \ Nvidia - with more GPU Droplet types to come. Read on to learn more about how\
  \ to choose the right GPU Droplet for your workload. AMD Instinctâ\x84¢ MI325X Use\
  \ cases: Large model training, fine-tuning, inference, and HPC Why choose: AMD Instinctâ\x84\
  ¢ MI325Xâ\x80\x99s large memory capacity allows it to hold models with hundreds\
  \ of billions of parameters entirely in memory, reducing the need for model splitting\
  \ across multiple GPUs. Key benefits: Memory performance: High memory capacity to\
  \ hold models with hundreds of billions of parameters, reducing the need for model\
  \ splitting across multiple GPUs Memory performance: High memory capacity to hold\
  \ models with hundreds of billions of parameters, reducing the need for model splitting\
  \ across multiple GPUs Value: Offered at a competitive price point ($1. 69/GPU/hr/contract)\
  \ for a HPC GPU. Contact us to reserve capacity. Value: Offered at a competitive\
