  \ Learn more about DigitalOcean GradientAI , our suite of AI products. Whether youâ\x80\
  \x99re new to AI and machine learning (ML) or a seasoned expert, looking to train\
  \ a large language model (LLM) or run cost-effective inference, DigitalOcean has\
  \ a GPU Droplet for you. We currently offer seven different GPU Droplet types from\
  \ industry-leading brands - AMD and Nvidia - with more GPU Droplet types to come.\
  \ Read on to learn more about how to choose the right GPU Droplet for your workload.\
  \ AMD Instinctâ\x84¢ MI325X Use cases: Large model training, fine-tuning, inference,\
  \ and HPC Why choose: AMD Instinctâ\x84¢ MI325Xâ\x80\x99s large memory capacity\
  \ allows it to hold models with hundreds of billions of parameters entirely in memory,\
  \ reducing the need for model splitting across multiple GPUs. Key benefits: Memory\
  \ performance: High memory capacity to hold models with hundreds of billions of\
  \ parameters, reducing the need for model splitting across multiple GPUs Value:\
  \ Offered at a competitive price point ($1. 69/GPU/hr/contract) for a HPC GPU. Contact\
  \ us to reserve capacity. Key performance benchmark: With 256 GB of HBM3E memory\
  \ (vs. MI300Xâ\x80\x99s 192 GB), MI325X can handle significantly larger models and\
  \ datasets entirely on a single GPU AMD Instinctâ\x84¢ MI300X Use cases: Generative\
