  \ NVIDIA HGX H200 is now available as a DigitalOcean GPU Droplet (virtual, on-demand\
  \ machines). NVIDIA HGX H200 is now available as a DigitalOcean GPU Droplet (virtual,\
  \ on-demand machines). NVIDIA HGX H200 GPU Droplets offer significant performance\
  \ improvements - up to 2x faster inference speeds and double the memory capacity\
  \ - compared to the H100. NVIDIA H200 GPU Droplets are designed for simplicity,\
  \ scalability, and cost-effectiveness, with on-demand pricing at just $3. 44/GPU/hr.\
  \ Weâ\x80\x99re expanding our AI/ML offerings with the introduction of new DigitalOcean\
  \ Gradientâ\x84¢ AI GPU Droplets , virtual machines accelerated by NVIDIA HGX H200.\
  \ This is a significant step forward in our mission to provide the simplest, most\
  \ scalable cloud for builders everywhere. For developers working on the cutting\
  \ edge of AI, the right hardware can make all the difference. NVIDIA HGX H200 is\
  \ built to handle the most demanding tasks in generative AI and high-performance\
  \ computing (HPC). Weâ\x80\x99re making it easier and more affordable for you to\
  \ tap into this power without the complexity and high costs often seen with other\
  \ providers. NVIDIA H200 is a state-of-the-art GPU that brings some serious advantages\
  \ to the table: Iterate and deploy faster: H200 GPU offers up to 2x faster inference\
  \ speeds than the NVIDIA H100 on large language models like Llama 2 70B. Iterate\
  \ and deploy faster: H200 GPU offers up to 2x faster inference speeds than the NVIDIA\
  \ H100 on large language models like Llama 2 70B."
