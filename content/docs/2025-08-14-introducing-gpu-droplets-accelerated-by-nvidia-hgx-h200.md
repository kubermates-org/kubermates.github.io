tldr: By Waverly Swinton Key Takeaways NVIDIA HGX H200 is now available as a DigitalOcean
  GPU Droplet (virtual, on-demand machines). NVIDIA HGX H200 GPU Droplets offer significant
  performance improvements - up to 2x faster inference speeds and double the memory
  capacity - compared to the H100.
summary: "By Waverly Swinton Key Takeaways NVIDIA HGX H200 is now available as a DigitalOcean\
  \ GPU Droplet (virtual, on-demand machines). NVIDIA HGX H200 GPU Droplets offer\
  \ significant performance improvements - up to 2x faster inference speeds and double\
  \ the memory capacity - compared to the H100. NVIDIA H200 GPU Droplets are designed\
  \ for simplicity, scalability, and cost-effectiveness, with on-demand pricing at\
  \ just $3. 44/GPU/hr. Weâ\x80\x99re expanding our AI/ML offerings with the introduction\
  \ of new DigitalOcean Gradientâ\x84¢ AI GPU Droplets , virtual machines accelerated\
  \ by NVIDIA HGX H200. This is a significant step forward in our mission to provide\
  \ the simplest, most scalable cloud for builders everywhere. For developers working\
  \ on the cutting edge of AI, the right hardware can make all the difference. NVIDIA\
  \ HGX H200 is built to handle the most demanding tasks in generative AI and high-performance\
  \ computing (HPC). Weâ\x80\x99re making it easier and more affordable for you to\
  \ tap into this power without the complexity and high costs often seen with other\
  \ providers. NVIDIA H200 is a state-of-the-art GPU that brings some serious advantages\
  \ to the table: Iterate and deploy faster: H200 GPU offers up to 2x faster inference\
  \ speeds than the NVIDIA H100 on large language models like Llama 2 70B. Access\
  \ larger memory capacity: First GPU to feature HBM3e memory, delivering a substantial\
  \ increase in memory bandwidth and capacity for better inference performance. The\
  \ H200 GPU features Its 141 GB of memory which is 76% higher than H100 and its memory\
  \ bandwidth is 43% higher than the H100."
