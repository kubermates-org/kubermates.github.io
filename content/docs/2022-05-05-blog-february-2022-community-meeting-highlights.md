  this year, and it was awesome to be back with you in that format. These meetings

summary: 'Author: Nigel Brown (VMware) We just had our first contributor community
  meeting this year, and it was awesome to be back with you in that format. These
  meetings will be happening on Zoom once per month, on the third Thursday of the
  month - that should be available in your calendar if you’re subscribed to the k-dev
  mailing list. Community meetings are an opportunity for you to meet synchronously
  with other members of the Kubernetes community to talk about issues of general appeal.
  This meeting kicked off with an update on the 1. 24 release with Xander Grzywinski,
  who is one of the shadows for the release team leads. This release is scheduled
  for April 19, 2022 with a code freeze scheduled for March 30th. At the time of the
  meeting there were 66 individual enhancements included, as well as bug fixes. You
  can join the conversation on Slack in #sig-release. Update: Kubernetes 1. 24 was
  delayed and released on May 3, 2022. From there, the discussion moved to the dockershim
  removal and the docs updates we need to make around that, with the discussion led
  by Kat Cosgrove. The main takeaway was that if you have a platform, talk to folks
  about this change.'
