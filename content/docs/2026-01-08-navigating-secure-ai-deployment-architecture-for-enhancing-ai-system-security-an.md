  Infrastructure Applications Virtualization Share In the previous articles, we discussed
  how integrating AI into business-critical systems opens up enterprises to a new
  set of risks with AI security and AI safety [ link ], and explored the evolving
  AI security and safety threat landscape, drawing from leading frameworks such as
  MITRE ATLAS, NIST, OWASP, and others [ link ]. In this article, we''ll examine the
  architectural considerations for deploying AI systems that are both secure and safe.
  A resilient AI architecture must be designed with a defense-in-depth philosophy,
  integrating controls that address both traditional cybersecurity threats and unique
  AI safety risks. The following components are essential pillars of an enterprise-grade
  AI system implementation that puts security front-and-center. These components are
  layered on top of each other to create a comprehensive security posture.'
