  Linux 10 (RHEL) launch at Red Hat Summit, I kept hearing one question from customers
  and partners: When would an offline version of the RHEL command-line assistant be
  available? Today I can announce that it''s on the way. As part of the RHEL 10.1
  update, an offline, locally available command-line assistant is officially in developer
  preview. For customers with a Red Hat Satellite subscription, it offers AI-powered
  RHEL guidance based on decades of enterprise Linux experience. Companies and agencies
  in finance, government, defense, industrial control, and other heightened-security
  industries will find it particularly useful. A key advantage of this design is its
  ability to function in completely disconnected, offline, or air-gapped environments,
  eliminating the need for external network connectivity. This allows users to receive
  AI-powered guidance and suggestions for a wide range of Red Hat Enterprise Linux
  tasks, including questions related to the RHEL installation process, troubleshooting,
  and more, without compromising security or relying on cloud-based services. Access
  to the offline, locally available command-line assistant requires a Red Hat Satellite
  subscription. The RHEL command-line assistant gets another improvement in RHEL 10.1
  (and RHEL 9.7, also launching today): an increase in its context limit, from 2KB
  to 32KB. Expanding the command-line assistant''s working memory unlocks more powerful,
  elaborate interactions. Now it can take on larger log files, pipe extensive data
  streams, and help with bigger tasks. Recent RHEL updates have focused squarely on
  making it easier for customers to embrace AI. With RHEL 10.1, we''re improving a
  key aspect of the interaction between the operating system and the hardware that
  supplies the raw computing power AI demands.'
