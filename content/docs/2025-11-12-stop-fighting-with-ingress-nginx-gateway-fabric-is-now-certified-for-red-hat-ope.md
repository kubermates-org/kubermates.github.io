  engineering teams know the drill. You need to connect, secure, and route traffic
  to your applications on OpenShift. Sometimes, it can feel like you’re wrestling
  with limitations or complexity at scale when managing traditional Ingress. Your
  platform deserves flexibility without giving up an ounce of control. That’s why
  we’ve been working closely with F5, and we''re happy to share that NGINX Gateway
  Fabric is now a certified operator for Red Hat OpenShift. For the thousands of teams
  already running NGINX and Red Hat OpenShift, this is the optimization you''ve been
  waiting for. It brings one of the most popular data planes directly into your trusted
  OpenShift workflow. You get a high-performance, familiar tool that is now fully
  supported and validated as part of your enterprise platform, ready to manage everything
  from simple web apps to critical APIs. The move from Ingress to the Kubernetes Gateway
  API is more than a technical swap; it''s a new, more powerful model for Kubernetes
  networking. Red Hat already provides a strong, native foundation for the Kubernetes
  Gateway API in OpenShift. This collaboration with NGINX builds on that foundation
  by bringing the new NGINX Gateway Fabric to Red Hat OpenShift, giving you a powerful
  choice. For many organizations, this is an ideal solution that gives you: A trusted
  data plane: Teams can now run the NGINX data plane they already trust for its battle-tested
  performance, all managed natively within Red Hat OpenShift.'
