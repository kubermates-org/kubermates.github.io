  by Zhengke Zhou CNCF projects highlighted in this post In today’s rapidly evolving
  AI landscape, effectively monitoring and debugging AI Gateways has become a critical
  challenge. This article shares my complete experience through the LFX Mentorship
  program, where I added OpenTelemetry distributed tracing support to kgateway’s AI
  Gateway functionality. From application strategies for LFX Mentorship to challenges
  and insights during project implementation, I hope this provides a valuable reference
  for students who want to participate in open source projects. Before applying for
  LFX Mentorship, I had already been exposed to [OpenTelemetry](https://opentelemetry.
  io/) during my internship, gaining foundational knowledge in the observability domain.
  More importantly, I participated in the Jaeger community’s development work to add
  Clickhouse support for traces ([PR #6935](https://github. com/jaegertracing/jaeger/pull/6935)),
  which gave me practical experience with distributed tracing. These experiences made
  me feel that the LFX Mentorship project about AI Gateway distributed tracing was
  an excellent opportunity to deepen my learning and contribute to the open source
  community. I know everyone gets excited when they see a project they’re interested
  in and can’t wait to apply. I adopted a different strategy: first deeply understand
  the project, actively participate in the community, and then submit the application.
  Instead of rushing to submit my application, I first went to actually experience
  the product involved in the project: [AI Gateway](https://kgateway. dev/docs/ai/about/).'
