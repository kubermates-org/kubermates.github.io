  Infrastructure Applications Virtualization Share Migrating a virtual machine (VM)
  from one platform to another is a complex task. Nevertheless, organizations are
  looking for a unified platform that provides the same benefits for VMs as what's
  available for containers. With Red Hat OpenShift Virtualization, you don't have
  to make the journey alone. The Assisted Installer for OpenShift supports deploying
  connected clusters with OpenShift Virtualization from the start, so you can begin
  your migration journey today and modernize at your own pace. The Assisted Installer
  simplifies the process of deploying connected OpenShift clusters by providing a
  guided, automated experience. Instead of relying on a dedicated bootstrap machine,
  the installer handles cluster bootstrapping as part of the installation process,
  reducing complexity and time to deployment. Available through a web-based UI, or
  API, the Assisted Installer gives you flexibility in how you manage installations.
  You can also integrate it with Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management to simplify deployment
  and ongoing management across multiple clusters, while still retaining the option
  to enable OpenShift Virtualization during installation. Virtualization-ready from
  day one With the Assisted Installer, you can enable OpenShift Virtualization during
  the cluster installation process. While some additional configuration may still
  be required, this approach simplifies deployment and shortens the path to running
  VM workloads alongside containers. The Assisted Installer also provides built-in
  pre-installation validations, checking for hardware and system requirements (CPU
  virtualization flags, memory, storage, and so on) before installation begins. This
  helps ensure that your environment is properly configured for virtualization and
  reduces the risk of deployment errors.
