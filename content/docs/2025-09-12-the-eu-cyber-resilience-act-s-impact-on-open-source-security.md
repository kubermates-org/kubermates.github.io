  Share The world runs on open source. From the applications you use daily to the
  critical infrastructure powering our society, open source software is ubiquitous.
  However, this widespread adoption has brought with it an escalating need for robust
  security, a reality starkly highlighted by incidents like SolarWinds and the more
  recent XZ Utils vulnerability. While the open source community often demonstrates
  remarkable resilience and collaboration in addressing threats, a significant shift
  in responsibility is now underway, driven in part by legislation, such as the EU''s
  Cyber Resilience Act (CRA). For decades, open source security was a communal effort,
  relying on the goodwill and expertise of contributors. As commercial entities increasingly
  integrate open source into their products, they''ve often overlooked security at
  the source (i. e. upstream), instead opting to bolt on fixes only at product release.
  Despite security engineers tirelessly advocating for practices like supply chain
  security, widespread adoption has been limited due to this afterthought mindset.
  Many organizations who are comfortable with their long-standing practices of consuming
  open source software have resisted re-evaluating their approach, operating under
  the dangerous and flawed assumption that since it worked fine for years and someone
  else always took care of it, there''s no need to change. This mindset ignores a
  fundamental truth: security isn''t about avoiding compromise, but about making it
  as difficult as possible for attackers when they inevitably strike. Now the CRA
  has arrived , aiming to address these very issues from a top-down perspective.'
