  \ June 30, 2025 4 min read Today, we are excited to announce our latest Role-Based\
  \ Access Control (RBAC) feature, custom roles. With custom roles, teams can now\
  \ assign permissions to individuals that are precisely aligned with their operational\
  \ and security requirements, reinforcing the principle of least privilege. This\
  \ allows for more precise permission management, which helps to enhance overall\
  \ infrastructure security by reducing the risk of over-privileged accounts. Custom\
  \ roles give you full control over who can do what on your projects, improving the\
  \ overall security of your cloud resources. In this blog post, we will walk through\
  \ what custom roles are, how they work, key features, when to use them, and how\
  \ they can help your team. Custom roles are user-defined sets of permissions that\
  \ allow organizations to tailor access control to their specific needs, beyond whatâ\x80\
  \x99s available in predefined roles. In other words, custom roles let you create\
  \ your own set of permissions instead of relying only on default, predefined roles\
  \ (like Viewer, Billing Viewer, etc. ) that may not work for you. Now, users can\
  \ define more detailed custom permissions that target specific resources and needs.\
  \ For example, a user may only need read access to Droplets, but write access to\
  \ Kubernetes. Hear what a DigitalOcean customer had to say about using custom roles."
