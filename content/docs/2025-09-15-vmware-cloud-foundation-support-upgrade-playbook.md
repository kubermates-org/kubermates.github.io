  Experience with VCF 9.0 Boost Operational Efficiency with VMware Cloud Foundation
  Our VMware Support team here at Broadcom is fully committed to helping our customers
  on their upgrade journeys. With the End of General Support date for VMware vSphere
  7 coming on October 2, 2025 , many of our customers have been reaching out looking
  for best practices and playbooks for upgrading. And this time around, we’re not
  just talking about upgrades from VMware vSphere 7 to VMware vSphere 8. We’ve seen
  an active uptick in preparation for customer migrations from vSphere 7 to VMware
  Cloud Foundation (VCF) 9.0. We know that planning and implementing upgrades can
  be stressful, so we figured that a new upgrade toolkit would be welcomed by our
  customers to help to make the process as smooth as possible by putting together
  pre-upgrade resources to help ensure success. To help you on your upgrade journey,
  whatever that might be, we created a playbook in the form of KB articles to guide
  you through the end to end process. This wide range of Product Upgrade Knowledge
  Base (KB) Articles provide easy to follow, step by step guides through the upgrade
  process, highlighting any areas requiring special attention through each of the
  following stages of the upgrade process: Preparation for upgrade Sequence and procedure
  for upgrading Post upgrade required tasks The suite of Upgrade KBs are listed below
  and we would encourage customers to engage with this content during their upgrade
  journeys. Upgrade VMware Cloud Foundation (VCF) 4. x and 5. x Upgrade ESXi 7. x
  to 8. x or Install ESXi Upgrade vCenter Server 7.0 to 8.0 Upgrade to VMware vSAN
  8 Upgrade to VMware Live Site Recovery 9.0 Upgrade to vSphere Replication 9.0 Upgrading
  to Aria Automation 8.18.'
