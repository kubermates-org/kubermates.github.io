summary: 'What is a Golden Kubestronaut? Once a Golden, Always a Golden Growing Together
  as a Community Thank You! Posted on August 21, 2025 by Christophe Sauthier, Cloud
  Native Training and Certification Lead The Kubestronauts program has been growing
  at an incredible pace. We recently celebrated over 2000 kubestronauts across the
  globe, and today we’re excited to celebrate another milestone: over 100 Golden Kubestronauts
  have achieved Golden status in less than five months, thanks to their dedication
  and hard work. One of the most inspiring aspects of the Golden Kubestronauts community
  is its global reach. With more than 100 Golden badges earned so far, we see representation
  from every corner of the world—spanning North and South America, Europe, Asia, and
  beyond. From Austria, Brazil, and Canada to India, Japan, and Singapore , and from
  Germany, the Netherlands, France and the United States to places like Bangladesh,
  Mongolia, and Vietnam , Golden Kubestronauts truly embody the global spirit of CNCF.
  This diversity highlights not only the worldwide adoption of cloud native technologies,
  but also the strength of a community that learns, grows, and achieves together—regardless
  of geography. Becoming a Golden Kubestronaut is the highest level of recognition
  in the program. It requires completing all CNCF certifications as well as the Linux
  Foundation Certified Sysadmin (LFCS). Starting October 15th, the Certified Cloud
  Native Platform Engineering Associate (CNPA) will also be added as part of this
  journey—just as all future CNCF certifications will be included as the program continues
  to evolve. Golden Kubestronauts are proof of what’s possible when passion, knowledge,
  persistence, and a love of cloud native come together. They embody the breadth of
  skills across the ecosystem, from Kubernetes administration to observability, security,
  platform engineering, and more. It’s important to highlight that once you’ve earned
  Golden Kubestronaut status, it’s yours for life.'
