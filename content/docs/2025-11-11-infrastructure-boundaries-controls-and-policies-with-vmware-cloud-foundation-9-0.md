  Virtualization virtue #3: Supporting application modernization As a Solutions Architect
  here at Broadcom who talks to our customer engineers on the daily, the biggest feedback
  I get about VMware Cloud Foundation (VCF) 9.0 is a fear (we’ll call it) about having
  less control with a self service model: “If you want something done right, you have
  to do it yourself. ” First of all, you will be doing it yourself through the enforcement
  of boundaries and policies at the onset. You don’t lose control : it is just front-loaded
  and implemented by applying the policies and boundaries at provisioning. With this
  approach you actually have more control with less administrative overhead. Second
  of all, if you are an infrastructure engineer, you are part of “ self” in “ self
  service” : in a cloud operating model, you will create infrastructure resources
  the same way everyone else does: using VCF Automation and Operations where your
  boundaries and restrictions are imposed in a standard and uniform way. Before we
  dive in, I would be remiss if I didn’t at least mention that VMware infrastructure
  as a private cloud is not new. Most of the components mentioned below have been
  around for more than a decade, and they are in the driver’s seat with VCF. If you
  are a cloud engineer of any sort, you will find yourself right at home with VCF:
  that’s the whole point. I have talked about this before , albeit indirectly, but
  like it or not, you provide infrastructure as a service to the people who consume
  your infrastructure. When you provision a VM, for example, you are providing a virtual
  machine and everything that goes with it. If it takes days or weeks for that VM
  to work its way through approvals, or it’s delayed because “we’re waiting on Derek
  to get back from vacation,” then you’ve already lost. VCF 9.0 provides a cloud native
  self service model which gives you more control and more security with less effort.'
