  Share IT teams are stuck between wanting to implement AI solutions across their
  organizations and dealing with the messy reality of increasingly complex infrastructure.
  Many are attempting to build their own automation solutions, cobbling together a
  patchwork of tools that, while well-intentioned, can actually make things worse.
  Red Hat dug into this with S&P Global Market Intelligence 451 Research, and their
  findings point to a simpler alternative : use a unified platform instead of patchworking
  tools together. Most teams are drowning in tools, often ending up with too many
  dashboards with too little coordination. A remarkable 72% of organizations are using
  up to 50 different IT tools, while nearly a third (28%) are managing over 50. This
  fragmented approach creates significant hurdles for effective IT automation, including:
  Complex implementations : This is a top obstacle for 58% of organizations. We often
  see this arise when customers deploy too many resources and move components piecemeal,
  slowing progress and increasing effort. Integration challenges : Integrating existing
  systems is a challenge for 51% of IT organizations. This isn''t just about connecting
  tools, it''s about achieving true interoperability for automation workflows. Skills
  gaps : 40% of respondents point to specific skills shortages. Maintaining expertise
  across a vast array of different tools is a constant drain on time and resources.
  This "do-it-yourself" mentality is particularly detrimental to AI initiatives.'
