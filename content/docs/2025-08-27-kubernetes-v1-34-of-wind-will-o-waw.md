summary: 'Editors: Agustina Barbetta, Alejandro Josue Leon Bellido, Graziano Casto,
  Melony Qin, Dipesh Rawat Similar to previous releases, the release of Kubernetes
  v1. 34 introduces new stable, beta, and alpha features. The consistent delivery
  of high-quality releases underscores the strength of our development cycle and the
  vibrant support from our community. This release consists of 58 enhancements. Of
  those enhancements, 23 have graduated to Stable, 22 have entered Beta, and 13 have
  entered Alpha. There are also some deprecations and removals in this release; make
  sure to read about those. A release powered by the wind around us — and the will
  within us. Every release cycle, we inherit winds that we don''t really control —
  the state of our tooling, documentation, and the historical quirks of our project.
  Sometimes these winds fill our sails, sometimes they push us sideways or die down.
  What keeps Kubernetes moving isn''t the perfect winds, but the will of our sailors
  who adjust the sails, man the helm, chart the courses and keep the ship steady.
  The release happens not because conditions are always ideal, but because of the
  people who build it, the people who release it, and the bears ^ , cats, dogs, wizards,
  and curious minds who keep Kubernetes sailing strong — no matter which way the wind
  blows. This release, Of Wind & Will (O'' WaW) , honors the winds that have shaped
  us, and the will that propels us forward.'
