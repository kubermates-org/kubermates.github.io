tldr: 'Who will get the most out of attending this event? What is new with Kyverno
  this year? What will the day look like? Should I do any homework first? Find your
  community! A special note from the chairs : Posted on September 15, 2025 by Co-chairs:
  Jim Bugwadia & Cortney Nickerson CNCF projects highlighted in this post This is
  the very first KyvernoCon ! While Kyverno has been part of the CNCF since November
  2020, and has had a strong presence at past KubeCon events through policy as code
  focused talks, maintainer sessions, and community meetups, this is the first time
  our community is gathering under one roof for a dedicated event. Kubernetes has
  become the standard for cloud native and AI/ML workloads, and large organizations
  need to automate security and compliance.'

  the very first KyvernoCon ! While Kyverno has been part of the CNCF since November
  2020, and has had a strong presence at past KubeCon events through policy as code
  focused talks, maintainer sessions, and community meetups, this is the first time
  our community is gathering under one roof for a dedicated event. Kubernetes has
  become the standard for cloud native and AI/ML workloads, and large organizations
  need to automate security and compliance. Hence, there is a critical need and growing
  awareness for policy as code. Over the past few years, Kyverno has matured significantly,
  becoming the most widely adopted CNCF policy engine. As we work towards becoming
  a graduated project and are continuing to incorporate new capabilities like CEL-based
  policies and a growing set of integrations across the ecosystem, the timing felt
  right to create a space where users, contributors, and platform teams can learn,
  share, and shape the future of policy as code together. KyvernoCon is designed for
  anyone building or running Kubernetes platforms, but especially valuable for: Organizations
  running Kubernetes at scale and for mission critical software, who are looking for
  unified governance across clusters, pipelines, and cloud. Platform engineers and
  SREs who want to leverage policy as code into day-to-day workflows for automated
  and secure delivery practices, cost savings, and a better overall developer experience.
  Security and compliance teams looking for practical ways to enforce standards and
  reduce risk. Developers and operators who want to understand how policy can improve
  reliability and speed. Adopters, contributors, and open-source enthusiasts eager
  to collaborate and shape Kyverno’s next chapter. Leaders and decision-makers curious
  about why policy as code has become a must-have in modern platform engineering and
  software delivery. If you touch Kubernetes in any way and care about doing it securely,
  sustainably, and at scale, you’ll get value out of spending the day with us.'
