  \ Metal GPUs. Learn more about DigitalOcean GradientAI , our suite of AI products.\
  \ Whether youâ\x80\x99re building a generative video platform like Moonvalley or\
  \ an advanced coding assistant like Supermaven , GPU computing is now a non-negotiable\
  \ for engineering AI applications. Whether itâ\x80\x99s for training LLMs or powering\
  \ real-time inference, these processors have become essential infrastructure for\
  \ startups working on AI products. DigitalOcean is powering this development by\
  \ providing a number of AI/ML offerings, including Bare Metal GPUs â\x80\x94dedicated\
  \ machines with NVIDIA Hopper architecture for the most demanding AI workloads.\
  \ These computing resources are available in our European data center based in Amsterdam,\
  \ Netherlands, giving EU-based companies (or international businesses with EU customers)\
  \ direct access to high-performance AI infrastructure right where they need it.\
  \ Build your AI projects with DigitalOceanâ\x80\x99s Bare Metal GPUs in Amsterdam.\
  \ Reserve capacity to experience the power of NVIDIA HGX H100 with up to 640 GB\
  \ of GPU RAM and enhanced NVLink for multi-GPU scaling. Contact our experts to talk\
  \ through your workload needs and join innovative companies who are already making\
  \ use of our high-performance, dedicated infrastructure for their AI/ML applications.\
  \ When it comes to AI applications, milliseconds matter. Placing your inference\
  \ workloads physically closer to your end users reduces the time it takes for requests\
  \ to travel to your servers and for responses to return. With DigitalOceanâ\x80\x99\
  s Bare Metal GPUs in Amsterdam, companies serving European markets can cut latency\
  \ compared to running the same workloads in data centers outside of Europe."
