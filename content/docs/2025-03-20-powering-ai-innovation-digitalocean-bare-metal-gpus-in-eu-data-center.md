summary: "By DigitalOcean Bare Metal GPUs are now DigitalOcean GradientAI Bare Metal\
  \ GPUs. Learn more about DigitalOcean GradientAI , our suite of AI products. Whether\
  \ youâ\x80\x99re building a generative video platform like Moonvalley or an advanced\
  \ coding assistant like Supermaven , GPU computing is now a non-negotiable for engineering\
  \ AI applications. Whether itâ\x80\x99s for training LLMs or powering real-time\
  \ inference, these processors have become essential infrastructure for startups\
  \ working on AI products. DigitalOcean is powering this development by providing\
  \ a number of AI/ML offerings, including Bare Metal GPUs â\x80\x94dedicated machines\
  \ with NVIDIA Hopper architecture for the most demanding AI workloads. These computing\
  \ resources are available in our European data center based in Amsterdam, Netherlands,\
  \ giving EU-based companies (or international businesses with EU customers) direct\
  \ access to high-performance AI infrastructure right where they need it. Build your\
  \ AI projects with DigitalOceanâ\x80\x99s Bare Metal GPUs in Amsterdam. Reserve\
  \ capacity to experience the power of NVIDIA HGX H100 with up to 640 GB of GPU RAM\
  \ and enhanced NVLink for multi-GPU scaling. Contact our experts to talk through\
  \ your workload needs and join innovative companies who are already making use of\
  \ our high-performance, dedicated infrastructure for their AI/ML applications. When\
  \ it comes to AI applications, milliseconds matter. Placing your inference workloads\
  \ physically closer to your end users reduces the time it takes for requests to\
  \ travel to your servers and for responses to return. With DigitalOceanâ\x80\x99\
  s Bare Metal GPUs in Amsterdam, companies serving European markets can cut latency\
  \ compared to running the same workloads in data centers outside of Europe."
