  READY STATUS IP NODE myapp-xyz 1/1 Running 10.244.1.5 worker-node-1 Great â€” but:
  That Pod IP is internal It changes if the Pod dies and restarts And if you have
  3 replicasâ€¦ which IP do you even hit? Thatâ€™s where Services come in.'

  What Is Kubernetes? Finally, a Simple Explanation! But hereâ€™s the next problem:
  You try running: kubectl get pods -o wide kubectl get pods -o wide And you see something
  like: NAME READY STATUS IP NODE myapp-xyz 1/1 Running 10.244.1.5 worker-node-1 NAME
  READY STATUS IP NODE myapp-xyz 1/1 Running 10.244.1.5 worker-node-1 Great â€” but:
  That Pod IP is internal It changes if the Pod dies and restarts And if you have
  3 replicasâ€¦ which IP do you even hit? Thatâ€™s where Services come in. You can think
  of it as: A permanent IP address or DNS name inside the cluster A load balancer
  that routes traffic to the right Pods A gateway between your app and the outside
  world (if needed) You attach a Service to a set of Pods using labels The Service
  tracks the matching Pods â€” even as Pods come and go Kubernetes uses something called
  kube-proxy to route traffic to the correct Pod behind the scenes So even if Pods
  restart, the Service endpoint never changes. Letâ€™s say you run 3 Pods of a web app
  with the label: app: myapp app: myapp You create a Service like this: selector:
  app: myapp selector: app: myapp Now, when someone accesses the Service: Kubernetes
  forwards the request to any of the healthy Pods Itâ€™s automatic, balanced, and reliable
  Imagine your appâ€™s Pods are like food trucks moving around a festival ground. A
  Service is like the signpost that says: You donâ€™t care where the trucks are parked
  â€” you just follow the sign. Kubernetes routes you to the right place, even if trucks
  come and go. Use the Kubernetes Playground: ðŸ‘‰ KodeKloud Kubernetes Playground Create
  a deployment: kubectl create deployment myapp --image=nginx kubectl expose deployment
  myapp --port=80 --type=NodePort kubectl get service kubectl create deployment myapp
  --image=nginx kubectl expose deployment myapp --port=80 --type=NodePort kubectl
  get service Now run: kubectl get pods -o wide kubectl describe service myapp kubectl
  get pods -o wide kubectl describe service myapp Look for the NodePort (e. g. , 30123
  ) and try opening: 30123 http://<worker-node-ip>:30123 http://<worker-node-ip>:30123
  Youâ€™re now accessing your app through a Kubernetes Service! Pods have dynamic IPs
  and can restart anytime A Service gives your app a stable endpoint Services load-balance
  traffic to healthy Pods You can expose your app internally or externally with different
  service types ðŸ“… Day 6: ConfigMaps & Secrets â€” Managing App Settings and Sensitive
  Data Youâ€™ll learn: Why you should never hardcode passwords or configs in containers
  How Kubernetes separates config data and secrets How to use them in real applications
  New here? Start from Day 1 and catch up on the series: Day 1: What Is Kubernetes
  & Why Should You Care? Discover why Kubernetes matters and how it changes the game.
  Day 2: What Are Pods in Kubernetes? Understand the smallest deployable unit in Kubernetes.
  Day 3: Understanding Nodes, Clusters & the Kubernetes Control Plane See how all
  the pieces connect behind the scenes. Day 4: Deployments & ReplicaSets â€” How Kubernetes
  Runs and Manages Your App Learn how Kubernetes keeps your apps running smoothly.'
