summary: 'By now, youâ€™ve launched a container, wrapped it in a Pod, deployed it using
  a Deployment, and scaled it up to multiple Pods. But hereâ€™s the next problem: You
  try running: And you see something like: Great â€” but: Thatâ€™s where Services come
  in. You can think of it as: So even if Pods restart, the Service endpoint never
  changes. Letâ€™s say you run 3 Pods of a web app with the label: You create a Service
  like this: Now, when someone accesses the Service: Imagine your appâ€™s Pods are like
  food trucks moving around a festival ground. A Service is like the signpost that
  says: You donâ€™t care where the trucks are parked â€” you just follow the sign. Kubernetes
  routes you to the right place, even if trucks come and go. Use the Kubernetes Playground:
  ðŸ‘‰ KodeKloud Kubernetes Playground Create a deployment: Now run: Look for the NodePort
  (e. g. , 30123 ) and try opening: Youâ€™re now accessing your app through a Kubernetes
  Service! ðŸ“… Day 6: ConfigMaps & Secrets â€” Managing App Settings and Sensitive Data
  Youâ€™ll learn: New here? Start from Day 1 and catch up on the series: Day 1: What
