The assessment phase involves evaluating technical feasibility for Amazon EKS workloads, analyzing current Kubernetes environments, identifying compatibility issues, estimating costs, and determining timelines with business impact considerations. During the mobilize phase, organizations create detailed migration plans, establish EKS environments with proper networking and security, train teams, and develop testing procedures. The final migrate and modernize phase involves transferring applications and data, validating functionality, implementing cloud-centered features, optimizing resources and costs, and enhancing observability to fully use AWS capabilities. One of the most significant challenges organizations face during the process is cost estimation, which happens in the assessment phase. Karpenter is an open source Kubernetes node autoscaler that efficiently provisions just-in-time compute resources to match workload demands. Unlike traditional autoscalers, Karpenter directly integrates with cloud providers to make intelligent, real-time decisions about instance types, availability zones, and capacity options. It evaluates pod requirements and constraints to select optimal instances, considering factors such as CPU, memory, price, and availability. Karpenter can consolidate workloads for cost efficiency and rapidly scale from zero to handle sudden demand spikes. It supports both spot and on-demand instances, and automatically terminates nodes when they’re no longer needed, optimizing cluster resource utilization and reducing cloud costs. Karpenter uses the concept of Providers to interact with different infrastructure platforms for provisioning and managing compute resources. KWOK (Kubernetes WithOut Kubelet) is a toolkit that simulates data plane nodes without allocating actual infrastructure, and can be used as a provider to create lightweight testing environments that enable developers to validate provisioning decisions, try various (virtual) instance types, and debug scaling behaviors.</description></item><item><title>Celebrating 100 Golden Kubestronauts</title><link>https://kubermates.org/events/2025-08-21-celebrating-100-golden-kubestronauts/</link><pubDate>Thu, 21 Aug 2025 13:59:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/events/2025-08-21-celebrating-100-golden-kubestronauts/</guid><description>&lt;p>The Kubestronauts program has been growing at an incredible pace.

This article focuses exclusively on tuning swap on Linux nodes, where this feature is available. By allowing Linux nodes to use secondary storage for additional virtual memory when physical RAM is exhausted, node swap support aims to improve resource utilization and reduce out-of-memory (OOM) kills. However, enabling swap is not a &amp;ldquo;turn-key&amp;rdquo; solution. The performance and stability of your nodes under memory pressure are critically dependent on a set of Linux kernel parameters. Misconfiguration can lead to performance degradation and interfere with Kubelet&amp;rsquo;s eviction logic. In this blogpost, I&amp;rsquo;ll dive into critical Linux kernel parameters that govern swap behavior. I will explore how these parameters influence Kubernetes workload performance, swap utilization, and crucial eviction mechanisms. I will present various test results showcasing the impact of different configurations, and share my findings on achieving optimal settings for stable and high-performing Kubernetes clusters. At a high level, the Linux kernel manages memory through pages, typically 4KiB in size. When physical memory becomes constrained, the kernel&amp;rsquo;s page replacement algorithm decides which pages to move to swap space.</description></item><item><title>Celebrating 100 Days of Kagent</title><link>https://kubermates.org/events/2025-08-19-celebrating-100-days-of-kagent/</link><pubDate>Tue, 19 Aug 2025 13:30:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/events/2025-08-19-celebrating-100-days-of-kagent/</guid><description>&lt;p>When we first introduced kagent on March 17th, 2025, we had a bold vision: to bring agentic AI to cloud native—empowering platforms and DevOps engineers to harness AI agents for solving real operational challenges.

Progressive delivery strategies, such as canary deployments, allow organizations to release new features by shifting traffic incrementally between old and new versions of a service. This allows organizations to first release features to a small subset of users, monitor system behavior and performance in real time, and automatically roll back if anomalies are detected. This is particularly valuable in modern microservices environments running on platforms such as Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (Amazon EKS) , where service meshes and traffic routers provide the necessary infrastructure for fine-grained control over traffic routing. This post explores an architectural approach to implementing progressive delivery using Amazon VPC Lattice, Amazon CloudWatch Synthetics , and Argo Rollouts. The solution uses VPC Lattice for enhanced traffic control across microservices, CloudWatch Synthetics for real-time health and validation monitoring, and Argo Rollouts for orchestrating canary updates. The content in this post addresses readers who are already familiar with networking constructs on Amazon Web Services (AWS), such as Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon VPC) , CloudWatch Synthetics and Amazon EKS. Instead of defining these services, we focus on their capabilities and integration with VPC Lattice. We also build upon your existing understanding of VPC Lattice concepts and Argo Rollouts. For more background on Amazon VPC Lattice, we recommend that you review the post, Build secure multi-account multi-VPC connectivity for your applications with Amazon VPC Lattice , and the collection of resources in the VPC Lattice Getting started guide. The architecture integrates multiple AWS services and Kubernetes-native components, providing a comprehensive solution for progressive delivery: In this section we consider an application running on Amazon EKS, where a new version of a microservice— prodDetail v2 —needs to be rolled out with minimal impact to users relying on the stable version v1. To do this, we implement a canary deployment strategy using VPC Lattice, Argo Rollouts, CloudWatch Synthetics, and AnalysisTemplates.</description></item><item><title>August 12, 2025</title><link>https://kubermates.org/releases/2025-08-12-august-12-2025/</link><pubDate>Tue, 12 Aug 2025 00:00:00 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/releases/2025-08-12-august-12-2025/</guid><description>&lt;p>Open the original post ↗ &lt;a href="https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/release-notes#August_12_2025">https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/release-notes#August_12_2025&lt;/a>&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Kubernetes v1.34.0-rc.1</title><link>https://kubermates.org/releases/2025-08-09-kubernetes-v1-34-0-rc-1/</link><pubDate>Sat, 09 Aug 2025 07:41:31 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/releases/2025-08-09-kubernetes-v1-34-0-rc-1/</guid><description>&lt;p>Open the original post ↗ &lt;a href="https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/releases/tag/v1.34.0-rc.1">https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/releases/tag/v1.34.0-rc.1&lt;/a>&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>August 08, 2025</title><link>https://kubermates.org/releases/2025-08-08-august-08-2025/</link><pubDate>Fri, 08 Aug 2025 00:00:00 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/releases/2025-08-08-august-08-2025/</guid><description>&lt;p>Open the original post ↗ &lt;a href="https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/release-notes#August_08_2025">https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/release-notes#August_08_2025&lt;/a>&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Introducing Headlamp AI Assistant</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-08-07-introducing-headlamp-ai-assistant/</link><pubDate>Thu, 07 Aug 2025 20:00:00 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-08-07-introducing-headlamp-ai-assistant/</guid><description>This announcement originally appeared on the Headlamp blog. To simplify Kubernetes management and troubleshooting, we&amp;rsquo;re thrilled to introduce Headlamp AI Assistant : a powerful new plugin for Headlamp that helps you understand and operate your Kubernetes clusters and applications with greater clarity and ease. Whether you&amp;rsquo;re a seasoned engineer or just getting started, the AI Assistant offers: Here is a demo of the AI Assistant in action as it helps troubleshoot an application running with issues in a Kubernetes cluster: Large Language Models (LLMs) have transformed not just how we access data but also how we interact with it. The rise of tools like ChatGPT opened a world of possibilities, inspiring a wave of new applications. Asking questions or giving commands in natural language is intuitive, especially for users who aren&amp;rsquo;t deeply technical. Now everyone can quickly ask how to do X or Y, without feeling awkward or having to traverse pages and pages of documentation like before. Therefore, Headlamp AI Assistant brings a conversational UI to Headlamp , powered by LLMs that Headlamp users can configure with their own API keys. It is available as a Headlamp plugin, making it easy to integrate into your existing setup. Users can enable it by installing the plugin and configuring it with their own LLM API keys, giving them control over which model powers the assistant. Once enabled, the assistant becomes part of the Headlamp UI, ready to respond to contextual queries and perform actions directly from the interface. As expected, the AI Assistant is focused on helping users with Kubernetes concepts. Yet, while there is a lot of value in responding to Kubernetes related questions from Headlamp&amp;rsquo;s UI, we believe that the great benefit of such an integration is when it can use the context of what the user is experiencing in an application.</description></item><item><title>Simplify network connectivity using Tailscale with Amazon EKS Hybrid Nodes</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-08-06-simplify-network-connectivity-using-tailscale-with-amazon-eks-hybrid-nodes/</link><pubDate>Wed, 06 Aug 2025 22:12:21 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-08-06-simplify-network-connectivity-using-tailscale-with-amazon-eks-hybrid-nodes/</guid><description>This post was co-authored with Lee Briggs, Director of Solutions Engineering at Tailscale. In this post, we guide you through integrating Tailscale with your Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS) Hybrid Nodes environment. Amazon EKS Hybrid Nodes is a feature of Amazon EKS that enables you to streamline your Kubernetes management by connecting on-premises and edge infrastructure to an EKS cluster running in Amazon Web Services (AWS). This unified approach allows AWS to manage the Kubernetes control plane in the cloud while you maintain your hybrid nodes in on-premises or edge locations. We demonstrate how to configure a remote pod network and node address space. Install Tailscale on your hybrid nodes, set up a subnet router within your Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon VPC) , and update your AWS routes accordingly. This integration provides direct, encrypted connections that streamline the network architecture needed for EKS Hybrid Nodes. Although EKS Hybrid Nodes streamlines the Kubernetes management challenge, network connectivity between your on-premises infrastructure and AWS remains a critical requirement. Tailscale can help streamline this network connectivity between your EKS Hybrid Nodes data plane and Amazon EKS Kubernetes control plane. Unlike traditional VPNs, which tunnel all network traffic through a central gateway server, Tailscale creates a peer-to-peer mesh network (known as a tailnet ). It enables encrypted point-to-point connections using the open source WireGuard protocol, connecting devices and services across different networks with enhanced security features. However, you can still use Tailscale like a traditional VPN.</description></item><item><title>Kubernetes v1.34.0-rc.0</title><link>https://kubermates.org/releases/2025-08-06-kubernetes-v1-34-0-rc-0/</link><pubDate>Wed, 06 Aug 2025 20:20:08 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/releases/2025-08-06-kubernetes-v1-34-0-rc-0/</guid><description>&lt;p>Open the original post ↗ &lt;a href="https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/releases/tag/v1.34.0-rc.0">https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/releases/tag/v1.34.0-rc.0&lt;/a>&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>v1.35.0-alpha.0</title><link>https://kubermates.org/releases/2025-08-06-v1-35-0-alpha-0/</link><pubDate>Wed, 06 Aug 2025 13:26:11 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/releases/2025-08-06-v1-35-0-alpha-0/</guid><description>&lt;p>Open the original post ↗ &lt;a href="https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/releases/tag/v1.35.0-alpha.0">https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/releases/tag/v1.35.0-alpha.0&lt;/a>&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>August 06, 2025</title><link>https://kubermates.org/releases/2025-08-06-august-06-2025/</link><pubDate>Wed, 06 Aug 2025 00:00:00 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/releases/2025-08-06-august-06-2025/</guid><description>&lt;p>Open the original post ↗ &lt;a href="https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/release-notes#August_06_2025">https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/release-notes#August_06_2025&lt;/a>&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>August 05, 2025</title><link>https://kubermates.org/releases/2025-08-05-august-05-2025/</link><pubDate>Tue, 05 Aug 2025 00:00:00 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/releases/2025-08-05-august-05-2025/</guid><description>&lt;p>Open the original post ↗ &lt;a href="https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/release-notes#August_05_2025">https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/release-notes#August_05_2025&lt;/a>&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>August 01, 2025</title><link>https://kubermates.org/releases/2025-08-01-august-01-2025/</link><pubDate>Fri, 01 Aug 2025 00:00:00 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/releases/2025-08-01-august-01-2025/</guid><description>&lt;p>Open the original post ↗ &lt;a href="https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/release-notes#August_01_2025">https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/release-notes#August_01_2025&lt;/a>&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Amazon EKS platform version update</title><link>https://kubermates.org/releases/2025-07-30-amazon-eks-platform-version-update/</link><pubDate>Wed, 30 Jul 2025 19:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/releases/2025-07-30-amazon-eks-platform-version-update/</guid><description>&lt;p>Open the original post ↗ &lt;a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/platform-versions.html">https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/platform-versions.html&lt;/a>&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>July 28, 2025</title><link>https://kubermates.org/releases/2025-07-28-july-28-2025/</link><pubDate>Mon, 28 Jul 2025 00:00:00 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/releases/2025-07-28-july-28-2025/</guid><description>&lt;p>Open the original post ↗ &lt;a href="https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/release-notes#July_28_2025">https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/release-notes#July_28_2025&lt;/a>&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Kubernetes v1.34 Sneak Peek</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-07-28-kubernetes-v1-34-sneak-peek/</link><pubDate>Mon, 28 Jul 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-07-28-kubernetes-v1-34-sneak-peek/</guid><description>Kubernetes v1. 34 is coming at the end of August 2025. This release will not include any removal or deprecation, but it is packed with an impressive number of enhancements. Here are some of the features we are most excited about in this cycle! Please note that this information reflects the current state of v1. 34 development and may change before release. The following list highlights some of the notable enhancements likely to be included in the v1. 34 release, but is not an exhaustive list of all planned changes. This is not a commitment and the release content is subject to change. Dynamic Resource Allocation (DRA) provides a flexible way to categorize, request, and use devices like GPUs or custom hardware in your Kubernetes cluster. Since the v1. 30 release, DRA has been based around claiming devices using structured parameters that are opaque to the core of Kubernetes. The relevant enhancement proposal, KEP-4381 , took inspiration from dynamic provisioning for storage volumes.</description></item><item><title>July 25, 2025</title><link>https://kubermates.org/releases/2025-07-25-july-25-2025/</link><pubDate>Fri, 25 Jul 2025 00:00:00 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/releases/2025-07-25-july-25-2025/</guid><description>&lt;p>Open the original post ↗ &lt;a href="https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/release-notes#July_25_2025">https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/release-notes#July_25_2025&lt;/a>&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Scaling beyond IPv4: integrating IPv6 Amazon EKS clusters into existing Istio Service Mesh</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-07-22-scaling-beyond-ipv4-integrating-ipv6-amazon-eks-clusters-into-existing-istio-ser/</link><pubDate>Tue, 22 Jul 2025 18:54:25 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-07-22-scaling-beyond-ipv4-integrating-ipv6-amazon-eks-clusters-into-existing-istio-ser/</guid><description>Organizations are increasingly adopting IPv6 for their Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (Amazon EKS) deployments, driven by three key factors: depletion of private IPv4 addresses, the need to streamline or eliminate overlay networks, and improved network security requirements on Amazon Web Services (AWS). In IPv6-enabled EKS clusters, each pod receives a unique IPv6 address from the Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon VPC) IPv6 range, with seamless compatibility facilitated by the Amazon EKS VPC Container Network Interface (CNI). This solution effectively addresses two major IPv4 limitations: the scarcity of private addresses and the security vulnerabilities created by overlapping IPv4 spaces that need Network Address Translation (NAT) at the node level. When transitioning to IPv6, you likely need to run both IPv4 and IPv6 EKS clusters simultaneously. This is particularly important for organizations using Istio Service Mesh with Amazon EKS, because IPv6 clusters must integrate with the existing Service Mesh and work smoothly alongside IPv4 clusters. To streamline this transition, you can configure your Istio Service Mesh to support both your current IPv4 EKS clusters and your new IPv6 EKS clusters. If Istio Service Mesh isn’t part of your infrastructure, then we suggest exploring Amazon VPC Lattice as an alternative solution to speed up your IPv6 implementation on AWS. This post provides a step-by-step guide for combining IPv6-enabled EKS clusters with your existing Istio Service Mesh and IPv4 workloads, enabling a graceful transition to IPv6 on AWS. This guide covers detailed instructions for enabling communication between IPv6 and IPv4 EKS clusters, along with recommended practices for implementing IPv6 across both single and multiple VPC configurations. The functionality of Amazon EKS IPv6 builds on the native dual-stack capabilities of VPC. When you enable IPv6 in your VPC, it receives both IPv4 prefixes and a /56 IPv6 prefix. This IPv6 prefix can come from three sources: Amazon’s Global Unicast Address (GUA) space, your own IPv6 range (BYOIPv6), or a Unique Local Address (ULA) space.</description></item><item><title>Deep dive into cluster networking for Amazon EKS Hybrid Nodes</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-07-21-deep-dive-into-cluster-networking-for-amazon-eks-hybrid-nodes/</link><pubDate>Mon, 21 Jul 2025 22:22:52 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-07-21-deep-dive-into-cluster-networking-for-amazon-eks-hybrid-nodes/</guid><description>Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service ( Amazon EKS ) Hybrid Nodes enables organizations to integrate their existing on-premises and edge computing infrastructure into EKS clusters as remote nodes. EKS Hybrid Nodes provides you with the flexibility to run your containerized applications wherever needed, while maintaining standardized Kubernetes management practices and addressing latency, compliance, and data residency needs. EKS Hybrid Nodes accelerates infrastructure modernization by repurposing existing hardware investments. Organizations can harness the elastic scalability, high availability, and fully managed advantages of Amazon EKS, while making sure of operational consistency through unified workflows and toolsets across hybrid environments. One of the key aspects of the EKS Hybrid Nodes solution is the hybrid network architecture between the cloud-based Amazon EKS control plane and your on-premises nodes. This post dives deep into the cluster networking configurations, guiding you through the process of integrating an EKS cluster with hybrid nodes in your existing infrastructure. In this walkthrough, we set up different Container Network Interface (CNI) options and load balancing solutions on EKS Hybrid Nodes to meet your networking requirements. EKS Hybrid Nodes needs private network connectivity between the cloud-hosted Amazon EKS control plane and the hybrid nodes running in your on-premises environment. This connectivity can be established using either Amazon Web Services (AWS) Direct Connect or AWS Site-to-Site VPN , through an AWS Transit Gateway or the Virtual Private Gateway into your Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon VPC). For an optimal experience, AWS recommends reliable network connectivity with at least 100 Mbps bandwidth, and a maximum of 200ms round-trip latency, for hybrid nodes connecting to the AWS Region. This is general guidance rather than a strict requirement, and specific bandwidth and latency requirements may differ based on the quantity of hybrid nodes and your application’s unique characteristics. The node and pod Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR) blocks for your hybrid nodes and container workloads must be within the IPv4 RFC-1918 ranges.</description></item><item><title>July 21, 2025</title><link>https://kubermates.org/releases/2025-07-21-july-21-2025/</link><pubDate>Mon, 21 Jul 2025 00:00:00 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/releases/2025-07-21-july-21-2025/</guid><description>&lt;p>Open the original post ↗ &lt;a href="https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/release-notes#July_21_2025">https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/release-notes#July_21_2025&lt;/a>&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>🧩 GitHub Actions Composite vs Reusable Workflows</title><link>https://kubermates.org/blog/github-actions-composite-vs-reusable-workflows-4bih/</link><pubDate>Fri, 18 Jul 2025 08:41:53 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/blog/github-actions-composite-vs-reusable-workflows-4bih/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="how-to-standardize-and-supercharge-your-cicd-pipelines-across-projects">How to standardize and supercharge your CI/CD pipelines across projects&lt;/h2>

While powerful quantum computers are still largely theoretical for many applications, their potential to break current cryptographic standards is a serious concern, especially for long-lived systems. This is where Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC) comes in. In this article, I&amp;rsquo;ll dive into what PQC means for TLS and, more specifically, for the Kubernetes ecosystem. I&amp;rsquo;ll explain what the (suprising) state of PQC in Kubernetes is and what the implications are for current and future clusters. Post-Quantum Cryptography refers to cryptographic algorithms that are thought to be secure against attacks by both classical and quantum computers. The primary concern is that quantum computers, using algorithms like Shor&amp;rsquo;s Algorithm , could efficiently break widely used public-key cryptosystems such as RSA and Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC), which underpin much of today&amp;rsquo;s secure communication, including TLS. The industry is actively working on standardizing and adopting PQC algorithms. One of the first to be standardized by NIST is the Module-Lattice Key Encapsulation Mechanism ( ML-KEM ), formerly known as Kyber, and now standardized as FIPS-203 (PDF download). It is difficult to predict when quantum computers will be able to break classical algorithms. However, it is clear that we need to start migrating to PQC algorithms now, as the next section shows. To get a feeling for the predicted timeline we can look at a NIST report covering the transition to post-quantum cryptography standards.</description></item><item><title>Kubernetes v1.34.0-beta.0</title><link>https://kubermates.org/releases/2025-07-16-kubernetes-v1-34-0-beta-0/</link><pubDate>Wed, 16 Jul 2025 14:40:38 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/releases/2025-07-16-kubernetes-v1-34-0-beta-0/</guid><description>&lt;p>Open the original post ↗ &lt;a href="https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/releases/tag/v1.34.0-beta.0">https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/releases/tag/v1.34.0-beta.0&lt;/a>&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>July 16, 2025</title><link>https://kubermates.org/releases/2025-07-16-july-16-2025/</link><pubDate>Wed, 16 Jul 2025 00:00:00 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/releases/2025-07-16-july-16-2025/</guid><description>&lt;p>Open the original post ↗ &lt;a href="https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/release-notes#July_16_2025">https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/release-notes#July_16_2025&lt;/a>&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Under the hood: Amazon EKS ultra scale clusters</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-07-16-under-the-hood-amazon-eks-ultra-scale-clusters/</link><pubDate>Wed, 16 Jul 2025 00:14:37 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-07-16-under-the-hood-amazon-eks-ultra-scale-clusters/</guid><description>This post was co-authored by Shyam Jeedigunta, Principal Engineer, Amazon EKS; Apoorva Kulkarni, Sr. Specialist Solutions Architect, Containers and Raghav Tripathi, Sr. Software Dev Manager, Amazon EKS. Today, Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (Amazon EKS) announced support for clusters with up to 100,000 nodes. With Amazon EC2’s new generation accelerated computing instance types, this translates to 1. 6 million AWS Trainium chips or 800,000 NVIDIA GPUs in a single Kubernetes cluster. This unlocks ultra scale artificial intelligence (AI) and machine leaning (ML) workloads such as state-of-the-art model training, fine-tuning and agentic inference. Besides customers directly consuming Amazon EKS today, these improvements also extend to other AI/ML services like Amazon SageMaker HyperPod with EKS that leverage EKS as their compute layer, advancing AWS’s overall ultra scale computing capabilities. Our customers have made it clear that containerization of training jobs and operators such as Kubeflow, the ability to streamline resource provisioning and lifecycle through projects like Karpenter, support for pluggable scheduling strategies, and access to a vast ecosystem of cloud-native tools is critical for their success in the AI/ML domain. Kubernetes has emerged as a key enabler here due to its powerful and extensible API model along with robust container orchestration capabilities, allowing accelerated workloads to scale quickly and run reliably. Through multiple technical innovations, architectural improvements and open-source collaboration, Amazon EKS has built the next generation of its cluster control plane and data plane for ultra scale, with full Kubernetes conformance. At AWS, we recommend customers running general-purpose applications with low coupling and horizontal scalability to follow a cell-based architecture as the strategy to sustain growth.</description></item><item><title>Amazon EKS enables ultra scale AI/ML workloads with support for 100K nodes per cluster</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-07-16-amazon-eks-enables-ultra-scale-ai-ml-workloads-with-support-for-100k-nodes-per-c/</link><pubDate>Wed, 16 Jul 2025 00:14:26 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-07-16-amazon-eks-enables-ultra-scale-ai-ml-workloads-with-support-for-100k-nodes-per-c/</guid><description>&lt;p>Open the original post ↗ &lt;a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/containers/amazon-eks-enables-ultra-scale-ai-ml-workloads-with-support-for-100k-nodes-per-cluster/">https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/containers/amazon-eks-enables-ultra-scale-ai-ml-workloads-with-support-for-100k-nodes-per-cluster/&lt;/a>&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Kubernetes v1.33.3</title><link>https://kubermates.org/releases/2025-07-15-kubernetes-v1-33-3/</link><pubDate>Tue, 15 Jul 2025 22:19:31 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/releases/2025-07-15-kubernetes-v1-33-3/</guid><description>&lt;p>Open the original post ↗ &lt;a href="https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/releases/tag/v1.33.3">https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/releases/tag/v1.33.3&lt;/a>&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Kubernetes v1.32.7</title><link>https://kubermates.org/releases/2025-07-15-kubernetes-v1-32-7/</link><pubDate>Tue, 15 Jul 2025 22:18:27 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/releases/2025-07-15-kubernetes-v1-32-7/</guid><description>&lt;p>Open the original post ↗ &lt;a href="https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/releases/tag/v1.32.7">https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/releases/tag/v1.32.7&lt;/a>&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>VPC CNI Multi-NIC feature for multi-homed pods</title><link>https://kubermates.org/releases/2025-07-15-vpc-cni-multi-nic-feature-for-multi-homed-pods/</link><pubDate>Tue, 15 Jul 2025 19:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/releases/2025-07-15-vpc-cni-multi-nic-feature-for-multi-homed-pods/</guid><description>&lt;p>Open the original post ↗ &lt;a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/pod-multiple-network-interfaces.html">https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/pod-multiple-network-interfaces.html&lt;/a>&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>July 14, 2025</title><link>https://kubermates.org/releases/2025-07-14-july-14-2025/</link><pubDate>Mon, 14 Jul 2025 00:00:00 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/releases/2025-07-14-july-14-2025/</guid><description>&lt;p>Open the original post ↗ &lt;a href="https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/release-notes#July_14_2025">https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/release-notes#July_14_2025&lt;/a>&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>July 11, 2025</title><link>https://kubermates.org/releases/2025-07-11-july-11-2025/</link><pubDate>Fri, 11 Jul 2025 00:00:00 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/releases/2025-07-11-july-11-2025/</guid><description>&lt;p>Open the original post ↗ &lt;a href="https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/release-notes#July_11_2025">https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/release-notes#July_11_2025&lt;/a>&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Navigating Failures in Pods With Devices</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-07-03-navigating-failures-in-pods-with-devices/</link><pubDate>Thu, 03 Jul 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-07-03-navigating-failures-in-pods-with-devices/</guid><description>Kubernetes is the de facto standard for container orchestration, but when it comes to handling specialized hardware like GPUs and other accelerators, things get a bit complicated. This blog post dives into the challenges of managing failure modes when operating pods with devices in Kubernetes, based on insights from Sergey Kanzhelev and Mrunal Patel&amp;rsquo;s talk at KubeCon NA 2024. You can follow the links to slides and recording. The rise of AI/ML workloads has brought new challenges to Kubernetes. These workloads often rely heavily on specialized hardware, and any device failure can significantly impact performance and lead to frustrating interruptions. As highlighted in the 2024 Llama paper , hardware issues, particularly GPU failures, are a major cause of disruption in AI/ML training. You can also learn how much effort NVIDIA spends on handling devices failures and maintenance in the KubeCon talk by Ryan Hallisey and Piotr Prokop All-Your-GPUs-Are-Belong-to-Us: An Inside Look at NVIDIA&amp;rsquo;s Self-Healing GeForce NOW Infrastructure ( recording ) as they see 19 remediation requests per 1000 nodes a day! We also see data centers offering spot consumption models and overcommit on power, making device failures commonplace and a part of the business model. However, Kubernetes’s view on resources is still very static. The resource is either there or not. And if it is there, the assumption is that it will stay there fully functional - Kubernetes lacks good support for handling full or partial hardware failures. These long-existing assumptions combined with the overall complexity of a setup lead to a variety of failure modes, which we discuss here. Generally, all AI/ML workloads require specialized hardware, have challenging scheduling requirements, and are expensive when idle.</description></item><item><title>July 02, 2025</title><link>https://kubermates.org/releases/2025-07-02-july-02-2025/</link><pubDate>Wed, 02 Jul 2025 00:00:00 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/releases/2025-07-02-july-02-2025/</guid><description>&lt;p>Open the original post ↗ &lt;a href="https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/release-notes#July_02_2025">https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/release-notes#July_02_2025&lt;/a>&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>VPC CNI troubleshooting content update</title><link>https://kubermates.org/releases/2025-06-30-vpc-cni-troubleshooting-content-update/</link><pubDate>Mon, 30 Jun 2025 19:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/releases/2025-06-30-vpc-cni-troubleshooting-content-update/</guid><description>&lt;p>Open the original post ↗ &lt;a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/network-policies-troubleshooting.html">https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/network-policies-troubleshooting.html&lt;/a>&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>June 27, 2025</title><link>https://kubermates.org/releases/2025-06-27-june-27-2025/</link><pubDate>Fri, 27 Jun 2025 00:00:00 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/releases/2025-06-27-june-27-2025/</guid><description>&lt;p>Open the original post ↗ &lt;a href="https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/release-notes#June_27_2025">https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/release-notes#June_27_2025&lt;/a>&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>AWS managed policy updates</title><link>https://kubermates.org/releases/2025-06-26-aws-managed-policy-updates/</link><pubDate>Thu, 26 Jun 2025 19:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/releases/2025-06-26-aws-managed-policy-updates/</guid><description>&lt;p>Open the original post ↗ &lt;a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/security-iam-awsmanpol.html">https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/security-iam-awsmanpol.html&lt;/a>&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>June 25, 2025</title><link>https://kubermates.org/releases/2025-06-25-june-25-2025/</link><pubDate>Wed, 25 Jun 2025 00:00:00 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/releases/2025-06-25-june-25-2025/</guid><description>&lt;p>Open the original post ↗ &lt;a href="https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/release-notes#June_25_2025">https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/release-notes#June_25_2025&lt;/a>&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Image Compatibility In Cloud Native Environments</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-06-25-image-compatibility-in-cloud-native-environments/</link><pubDate>Wed, 25 Jun 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-06-25-image-compatibility-in-cloud-native-environments/</guid><description>In industries where systems must run very reliably and meet strict performance criteria such as telecommunication, high-performance or AI computing, containerized applications often need specific operating system configuration or hardware presence. It is common practice to require the use of specific versions of the kernel, its configuration, device drivers, or system components. Despite the existence of the Open Container Initiative (OCI) , a governing community to define standards and specifications for container images, there has been a gap in expression of such compatibility requirements. The need to address this issue has led to different proposals and, ultimately, an implementation in Kubernetes&amp;rsquo; Node Feature Discovery (NFD). NFD is an open source Kubernetes project that automatically detects and reports hardware and system features of cluster nodes. This information helps users to schedule workloads on nodes that meet specific system requirements, which is especially useful for applications with strict hardware or operating system dependencies. A container image is built on a base image, which provides a minimal runtime environment, often a stripped-down Linux userland, completely empty or distroless. When an application requires certain features from the host OS, compatibility issues arise. These dependencies can manifest in several ways: While containers in Kubernetes are the most likely unit of abstraction for these needs, the definition of compatibility can extend further to include other container technologies such as Singularity and other OCI artifacts such as binaries from a spack binary cache. Containerized applications are deployed across various Kubernetes distributions and cloud providers, where different host operating systems introduce compatibility challenges. Often those have to be pre-configured before workload deployment or are immutable. For instance, different cloud providers will include different operating systems like: Each OS comes with unique kernel versions, configurations, and drivers, making compatibility a non-trivial issue for applications requiring specific features.</description></item><item><title>June 24, 2025</title><link>https://kubermates.org/releases/2025-06-24-june-24-2025/</link><pubDate>Tue, 24 Jun 2025 00:00:00 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/releases/2025-06-24-june-24-2025/</guid><description>&lt;p>Open the original post ↗ &lt;a href="https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/release-notes#June_24_2025">https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/release-notes#June_24_2025&lt;/a>&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>June 18, 2025</title><link>https://kubermates.org/releases/2025-06-18-june-18-2025/</link><pubDate>Wed, 18 Jun 2025 00:00:00 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/releases/2025-06-18-june-18-2025/</guid><description>&lt;p>Open the original post ↗ &lt;a href="https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/release-notes#June_18_2025">https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/release-notes#June_18_2025&lt;/a>&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>June 16, 2025</title><link>https://kubermates.org/releases/2025-06-16-june-16-2025/</link><pubDate>Mon, 16 Jun 2025 00:00:00 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/releases/2025-06-16-june-16-2025/</guid><description>&lt;p>Open the original post ↗ &lt;a href="https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/release-notes#June_16_2025">https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/release-notes#June_16_2025&lt;/a>&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Changes to Kubernetes Slack</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-06-16-changes-to-kubernetes-slack/</link><pubDate>Mon, 16 Jun 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-06-16-changes-to-kubernetes-slack/</guid><description>UPDATE : We’ve received notice from Salesforce that our Slack workspace WILL NOT BE DOWNGRADED on June 20th. Stand by for more details, but for now, there is no urgency to back up private channels or direct messages. Kubernetes Slack will lose its special status and will be changing into a standard free Slack on June 20, 2025. Sometime later this year, our community may move to a new platform. If you are responsible for a channel or private channel, or a member of a User Group, you will need to take some actions as soon as you can. For the last decade, Slack has supported our project with a free customized enterprise account. They have let us know that they can no longer do so, particularly since our Slack is one of the largest and more active ones on the platform. As such, they will be downgrading it to a standard free Slack while we decide on, and implement, other options. On Friday, June 20, we will be subject to the feature limitations of free Slack. The primary ones which will affect us will be only retaining 90 days of history, and having to disable several apps and workflows which we are currently using. The Slack Admin team will do their best to manage these limitations. Responsible channel owners, members of private channels, and members of User Groups should take some actions to prepare for the upgrade and preserve information as soon as possible.</description></item><item><title>Amazon EKS Auto Mode update to NodeClass</title><link>https://kubermates.org/releases/2025-06-13-amazon-eks-auto-mode-update-to-nodeclass/</link><pubDate>Fri, 13 Jun 2025 19:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/releases/2025-06-13-amazon-eks-auto-mode-update-to-nodeclass/</guid><description>&lt;p>Open the original post ↗ &lt;a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/create-node-class.html#auto-node-class-spec">https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/create-node-class.html#auto-node-class-spec&lt;/a>&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>June 12, 2025</title><link>https://kubermates.org/releases/2025-06-12-june-12-2025/</link><pubDate>Thu, 12 Jun 2025 00:00:00 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/releases/2025-06-12-june-12-2025/</guid><description>&lt;p>Open the original post ↗ &lt;a href="https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/release-notes#June_12_2025">https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/release-notes#June_12_2025&lt;/a>&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Target secondary and cross-account roles with EKS Pod Identities</title><link>https://kubermates.org/releases/2025-06-11-target-secondary-and-cross-account-roles-with-eks-pod-identities/</link><pubDate>Wed, 11 Jun 2025 19:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/releases/2025-06-11-target-secondary-and-cross-account-roles-with-eks-pod-identities/</guid><description>&lt;p>Open the original post ↗ &lt;a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/pod-id-assign-target-role.html">https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/pod-id-assign-target-role.html&lt;/a>&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>June 10, 2025</title><link>https://kubermates.org/releases/2025-06-10-june-10-2025/</link><pubDate>Tue, 10 Jun 2025 00:00:00 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/releases/2025-06-10-june-10-2025/</guid><description>&lt;p>Open the original post ↗ &lt;a href="https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/release-notes#June_10_2025">https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/release-notes#June_10_2025&lt;/a>&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Enhancing Kubernetes Event Management with Custom Aggregation</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-06-10-enhancing-kubernetes-event-management-with-custom-aggregation/</link><pubDate>Tue, 10 Jun 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-06-10-enhancing-kubernetes-event-management-with-custom-aggregation/</guid><description>Kubernetes Events provide crucial insights into cluster operations, but as clusters grow, managing and analyzing these events becomes increasingly challenging. This blog post explores how to build custom event aggregation systems that help engineering teams better understand cluster behavior and troubleshoot issues more effectively. In a Kubernetes cluster, events are generated for various operations - from pod scheduling and container starts to volume mounts and network configurations. While these events are invaluable for debugging and monitoring, several challenges emerge in production environments: To learn more about Events in Kubernetes, read the Event API reference. Consider a production environment with tens of microservices where the users report intermittent transaction failures: Traditional event aggregation process: Engineers are wasting hours sifting through thousands of standalone events spread across namespaces. By the time they look into it, the older events have long since purged, and correlating pod restarts to node-level issues is practically impossible. With its event aggregation in its custom events: The system groups events across resources, instantly surfacing correlation patterns such as volume mount timeouts before pod restarts. History indicates it occurred during past record traffic spikes, highlighting a storage scalability issue in minutes rather than hours. The beneﬁt of this approach is that organizations that implement it commonly cut down their troubleshooting time significantly along with increasing the reliability of systems by detecting patterns early. This post explores how to build a custom event aggregation system that addresses these challenges, aligned to Kubernetes best practices. I&amp;rsquo;ve picked the Go programming language for my example. This event aggregation system consists of three main components: Here&amp;rsquo;s a sketch for how to implement the event watcher: The event processor enriches events with additional context and classification: One of the key features you could implement is a way of correlating related Events.</description></item><item><title>Amazon EKS AWS Region expansion</title><link>https://kubermates.org/releases/2025-06-06-amazon-eks-aws-region-expansion/</link><pubDate>Fri, 06 Jun 2025 19:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/releases/2025-06-06-amazon-eks-aws-region-expansion/</guid><description>&lt;p>Open the original post ↗ &lt;a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/doc-history.html">https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/doc-history.html&lt;/a>&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>IPv6 access control for dual-stack public endpoints for new IPv6 clusters</title><link>https://kubermates.org/releases/2025-06-05-ipv6-access-control-for-dual-stack-public-endpoints-for-new-ipv6-clusters/</link><pubDate>Thu, 05 Jun 2025 19:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/releases/2025-06-05-ipv6-access-control-for-dual-stack-public-endpoints-for-new-ipv6-clusters/</guid><description>&lt;p>Open the original post ↗ &lt;a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/#IPv6_access_control_for_dual-stack_public_endpoints_for_new_IPv6_clusters_2025-06-05">https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/#IPv6_access_control_for_dual-stack_public_endpoints_for_new_IPv6_clusters_2025-06-05&lt;/a>&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>June 05, 2025</title><link>https://kubermates.org/releases/2025-06-05-june-05-2025/</link><pubDate>Thu, 05 Jun 2025 00:00:00 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/releases/2025-06-05-june-05-2025/</guid><description>&lt;p>Open the original post ↗ &lt;a href="https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/release-notes#June_05_2025">https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/release-notes#June_05_2025&lt;/a>&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Introducing Gateway API Inference Extension</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-06-05-introducing-gateway-api-inference-extension/</link><pubDate>Thu, 05 Jun 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-06-05-introducing-gateway-api-inference-extension/</guid><description>Modern generative AI and large language model (LLM) services create unique traffic-routing challenges on Kubernetes. Unlike typical short-lived, stateless web requests, LLM inference sessions are often long-running, resource-intensive, and partially stateful. For example, a single GPU-backed model server may keep multiple inference sessions active and maintain in-memory token caches. Traditional load balancers focused on HTTP path or round-robin lack the specialized capabilities needed for these workloads. They also don’t account for model identity or request criticality (e. g. , interactive chat vs. batch jobs). Organizations often patch together ad-hoc solutions, but a standardized approach is missing. Gateway API Inference Extension was created to address this gap by building on the existing Gateway API , adding inference-specific routing capabilities while retaining the familiar model of Gateways and HTTPRoutes. By adding an inference extension to your existing gateway, you effectively transform it into an Inference Gateway , enabling you to self-host GenAI/LLMs with a “model-as-a-service” mindset. The project’s goal is to improve and standardize routing to inference workloads across the ecosystem.</description></item><item><title>Start Sidecar First: How To Avoid Snags</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-06-03-start-sidecar-first-how-to-avoid-snags/</link><pubDate>Tue, 03 Jun 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-06-03-start-sidecar-first-how-to-avoid-snags/</guid><description>From the Kubernetes Multicontainer Pods: An Overview blog post you know what their job is, what are the main architectural patterns, and how they are implemented in Kubernetes.

v1.33: In-Place Pod Resize Graduated to Beta</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-05-16-kubernetes-v1-33-in-place-pod-resize-graduated-to-beta/</link><pubDate>Fri, 16 May 2025 10:30:00 -0800</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-05-16-kubernetes-v1-33-in-place-pod-resize-graduated-to-beta/</guid><description>On behalf of the Kubernetes project, I am excited to announce that the in-place Pod resize feature (also known as In-Place Pod Vertical Scaling), first introduced as alpha in Kubernetes v1. 27, has graduated to Beta and will be enabled by default in the Kubernetes v1. 33 release! This marks a significant milestone in making resource management for Kubernetes workloads more flexible and less disruptive. Traditionally, changing the CPU or memory resources allocated to a container required restarting the Pod. While acceptable for many stateless applications, this could be disruptive for stateful services, batch jobs, or any workloads sensitive to restarts. In-place Pod resizing allows you to change the CPU and memory requests and limits assigned to containers within a running Pod, often without requiring a container restart. Here&amp;rsquo;s the core idea: You can try it out on a v1. 33 Kubernetes cluster by using kubectl to edit a Pod (requires kubectl v1. 32+): For detailed usage instructions and examples, please refer to the official Kubernetes documentation: Resize CPU and Memory Resources assigned to Containers. Kubernetes still excels at scaling workloads horizontally (adding or removing replicas), but in-place Pod resizing unlocks several key benefits for vertical scaling: Since the alpha release in v1. 27, significant work has gone into maturing the feature, improving its stability, and refining the user experience based on feedback and further development. Here are the key changes: Graduating to Beta means the feature is ready for broader adoption, but development doesn&amp;rsquo;t stop here! Here&amp;rsquo;s what the community is focusing on next: With the InPlacePodVerticalScaling feature gate enabled by default in v1.</description></item><item><title>May 16, 2025</title><link>https://kubermates.org/releases/2025-05-16-may-16-2025/</link><pubDate>Fri, 16 May 2025 00:00:00 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/releases/2025-05-16-may-16-2025/</guid><description>&lt;p>Open the original post ↗ &lt;a href="https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/release-notes#May_16_2025">https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/release-notes#May_16_2025&lt;/a>&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Announcing etcd v3.6.0</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-05-15-announcing-etcd-v3-6-0/</link><pubDate>Thu, 15 May 2025 16:00:00 -0800</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-05-15-announcing-etcd-v3-6-0/</guid><description>This announcement originally appeared on the etcd blog.

In batch workloads, you might want to use leader-follower patterns like MPI , in which the leader controls the execution, including the followers&amp;rsquo; lifecycle. In this case, you might want to mark it as succeeded even if some of the indexes failed. Unfortunately, a leader-follower Kubernetes Job that didn&amp;rsquo;t use a success policy, in most cases, would have to require all Pods to finish successfully for that Job to reach an overall succeeded state. For Kubernetes Jobs, the API allows you to specify the early exit criteria using the. spec. successPolicy field (you can only use the. spec. successPolicy field for an indexed Job ). Which describes a set of rules either using a list of succeeded indexes for a job, or defining a minimal required size of succeeded indexes. This newly stable field is especially valuable for scientific simulation, AI/ML and High-Performance Computing (HPC) batch workloads.</description></item><item><title>Kubernetes v1.33: Updates to Container Lifecycle</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-05-14-kubernetes-v1-33-updates-to-container-lifecycle/</link><pubDate>Wed, 14 May 2025 10:30:00 -0800</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-05-14-kubernetes-v1-33-updates-to-container-lifecycle/</guid><description>Kubernetes v1. 33 introduces a few updates to the lifecycle of containers. The Sleep action for container lifecycle hooks now supports a zero sleep duration (feature enabled by default). There is also alpha support for customizing the stop signal sent to containers when they are being terminated. This blog post goes into the details of these new aspects of the container lifecycle, and how you can use them. Kubernetes v1. 29 introduced the Sleep action for container PreStop and PostStart Lifecycle hooks. The Sleep action lets your containers pause for a specified duration after the container is started or before it is terminated. This was needed to provide a straightforward way to manage graceful shutdowns. Before the Sleep action, folks used to run the sleep command using the exec action in their container lifecycle hooks. If you wanted to do this you&amp;rsquo;d need to have the binary for the sleep command in your container image. This is difficult if you&amp;rsquo;re using third party images.</description></item><item><title>Kubernetes v1.33: Job's Backoff Limit Per Index Goes GA</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-05-13-kubernetes-v1-33-job-s-backoff-limit-per-index-goes-ga/</link><pubDate>Tue, 13 May 2025 10:30:00 -0800</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-05-13-kubernetes-v1-33-job-s-backoff-limit-per-index-goes-ga/</guid><description>In Kubernetes v1. 33, the Backoff Limit Per Index feature reaches general availability (GA). This blog describes the Backoff Limit Per Index feature and its benefits. When you run workloads on Kubernetes, you must consider scenarios where Pod failures can affect the completion of your workloads. Ideally, your workload should tolerate transient failures and continue running. To achieve failure tolerance in a Kubernetes Job, you can set the spec. backoffLimit field. This field specifies the total number of tolerated failures. However, for workloads where every index is considered independent, like embarassingly parallel workloads - the spec. backoffLimit field is often not flexible enough. For example, you may choose to run multiple suites of integration tests by representing each suite as an index within an Indexed Job. In that setup, a fast-failing index (test suite) is likely to consume your entire budget for tolerating Pod failures, and you might not be able to run the other indexes.</description></item><item><title>May 13, 2025</title><link>https://kubermates.org/releases/2025-05-13-may-13-2025/</link><pubDate>Tue, 13 May 2025 00:00:00 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/releases/2025-05-13-may-13-2025/</guid><description>&lt;p>Open the original post ↗ &lt;a href="https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/release-notes#May_13_2025">https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/release-notes#May_13_2025&lt;/a>&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Kubernetes v1.33: Image Pull Policy the way you always thought it worked!</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-05-12-kubernetes-v1-33-image-pull-policy-the-way-you-always-thought-it-worked/</link><pubDate>Mon, 12 May 2025 10:30:00 -0800</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-05-12-kubernetes-v1-33-image-pull-policy-the-way-you-always-thought-it-worked/</guid><description>Some things in Kubernetes are surprising, and the way imagePullPolicy behaves might be one of them. Given Kubernetes is all about running pods, it may be peculiar to learn that there has been a caveat to restricting pod access to authenticated images for over 10 years in the form of issue 18787 ! It is an exciting release when you can resolve a ten-year-old issue. The gist of the problem is that the imagePullPolicy: IfNotPresent strategy has done precisely what it says, and nothing more. Let&amp;rsquo;s set up a scenario. To begin, Pod A in Namespace X is scheduled to Node 1 and requires image Foo from a private repository. For it&amp;rsquo;s image pull authentication material, the pod references Secret 1 in its imagePullSecrets. Secret 1 contains the necessary credentials to pull from the private repository. The Kubelet will utilize the credentials from Secret 1 as supplied by Pod A and it will pull container image Foo from the registry. This is the intended (and secure) behavior. But now things get curious. If Pod B in Namespace Y happens to also be scheduled to Node 1 , unexpected (and potentially insecure) things happen. Pod B may reference the same private image, specifying the IfNotPresent image pull policy.</description></item><item><title>Kubernetes v1.33: Streaming List responses</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-05-09-kubernetes-v1-33-streaming-list-responses/</link><pubDate>Fri, 09 May 2025 10:30:00 -0800</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-05-09-kubernetes-v1-33-streaming-list-responses/</guid><description>Managing Kubernetes cluster stability becomes increasingly critical as your infrastructure grows. One of the most challenging aspects of operating large-scale clusters has been handling List requests that fetch substantial datasets - a common operation that could unexpectedly impact your cluster&amp;rsquo;s stability. Today, the Kubernetes community is excited to announce a significant architectural improvement: streaming encoding for List responses. Current API response encoders just serialize an entire response into a single contiguous memory and perform one ResponseWriter. Write call to transmit data to the client. Despite HTTP/2&amp;rsquo;s capability to split responses into smaller frames for transmission, the underlying HTTP server continues to hold the complete response data as a single buffer. Even as individual frames are transmitted to the client, the memory associated with these frames cannot be freed incrementally. When cluster size grows, the single response body can be substantial - like hundreds of megabytes in size. At large scale, the current approach becomes particularly inefficient, as it prevents incremental memory release during transmission. Imagining that when network congestion occurs, that large response body’s memory block stays active for tens of seconds or even minutes. This limitation leads to unnecessarily high and prolonged memory consumption in the kube-apiserver process. If multiple large List requests occur simultaneously, the cumulative memory consumption can escalate rapidly, potentially leading to an Out-of-Memory (OOM) situation that compromises cluster stability.</description></item><item><title>Kubernetes 1.33: Volume Populators Graduate to GA</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-05-08-kubernetes-1-33-volume-populators-graduate-to-ga/</link><pubDate>Thu, 08 May 2025 10:30:00 -0800</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-05-08-kubernetes-1-33-volume-populators-graduate-to-ga/</guid><description>Kubernetes volume populators are now generally available (GA)! The AnyVolumeDataSource feature gate is treated as always enabled for Kubernetes v1. 33, which means that users can specify any appropriate custom resource as the data source of a PersistentVolumeClaim (PVC). An example of how to use dataSourceRef in PVC: There are four major enhancements from beta. During the beta phase, contributors to Kubernetes identified potential resource leaks with PersistentVolumeClaim (PVC) deletion while volume population was in progress; these leaks happened due to limitations in finalizer handling. Ahead of the graduation to general availability, the Kubernetes project added support to delete temporary resources (PVC prime, etc. ) if the original PVC is deleted. To accommodate this, we&amp;rsquo;ve introduced three new plugin-based functions: A provider example is added in lib-volume-populator/example. For GA, the CSI volume populator controller code gained a MutatorConfig , allowing the specification of mutator functions to modify Kubernetes resources. For example, if the PVC prime is not an exact copy of the PVC and you need provider-specific information for the driver, you can include this information in the optional MutatorConfig. This allows you to customize the Kubernetes objects in the volume populator. Our beta phase highlighted a new requirement: the need to aggregate metrics not just from lib-volume-populator, but also from other components within the provider&amp;rsquo;s codebase. To address this, SIG Storage introduced a provider metric manager.</description></item><item><title>Kubernetes v1.33: From Secrets to Service Accounts: Kubernetes Image Pulls Evolved</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-05-07-kubernetes-v1-33-from-secrets-to-service-accounts-kubernetes-image-pulls-evolved/</link><pubDate>Wed, 07 May 2025 10:30:00 -0800</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-05-07-kubernetes-v1-33-from-secrets-to-service-accounts-kubernetes-image-pulls-evolved/</guid><description>Kubernetes has steadily evolved to reduce reliance on long-lived credentials stored in the API. A prime example of this shift is the transition of Kubernetes Service Account (KSA) tokens from long-lived, static tokens to ephemeral, automatically rotated tokens with OpenID Connect (OIDC)-compliant semantics. This advancement enables workloads to securely authenticate with external services without needing persistent secrets. However, one major gap remains: image pull authentication. Today, Kubernetes clusters rely on image pull secrets stored in the API, which are long-lived and difficult to rotate, or on node-level kubelet credential providers, which allow any pod running on a node to access the same credentials. This presents security and operational challenges. To address this, Kubernetes is introducing Service Account Token Integration for Kubelet Credential Providers , now available in alpha. This enhancement allows credential providers to use pod-specific service account tokens to obtain registry credentials, which kubelet can then use for image pulls — eliminating the need for long-lived image pull secrets. Currently, Kubernetes administrators have two primary options for handling private container image pulls: Image pull secrets stored in the Kubernetes API Kubelet credential providers Neither approach aligns with the principles of least privilege or ephemeral authentication , leaving Kubernetes with a security gap. This new enhancement enables kubelet credential providers to use workload identity when fetching image registry credentials. Instead of relying on long-lived secrets, credential providers can use service account tokens to request short-lived credentials tied to a specific pod’s identity. This approach provides: Kubelet generates short-lived, automatically rotated tokens for service accounts if the credential provider it communicates with has opted into receiving a service account token for image pulls.</description></item><item><title>Kubernetes v1.33: Fine-grained SupplementalGroups Control Graduates to Beta</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-05-06-kubernetes-v1-33-fine-grained-supplementalgroups-control-graduates-to-beta/</link><pubDate>Tue, 06 May 2025 10:30:00 -0800</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-05-06-kubernetes-v1-33-fine-grained-supplementalgroups-control-graduates-to-beta/</guid><description>The new field, supplementalGroupsPolicy , was introduced as an opt-in alpha feature for Kubernetes v1. 31 and has graduated to beta in v1. 33; the corresponding feature gate ( SupplementalGroupsPolicy ) is now enabled by default. This feature enables to implement more precise control over supplemental groups in containers that can strengthen the security posture, particularly in accessing volumes. Moreover, it also enhances the transparency of UID/GID details in containers, offering improved security oversight. Please be aware that this beta release contains some behavioral breaking change. See The Behavioral Changes Introduced In Beta and Upgrade Considerations sections for details. Although the majority of Kubernetes cluster admins/users may not be aware, kubernetes, by default, merges group information from the Pod with information defined in /etc/group in the container image. Let&amp;rsquo;s see an example, below Pod manifest specifies runAsUser=1000 , runAsGroup=3000 and supplementalGroups=4000 in the Pod&amp;rsquo;s security context. What is the result of id command in the ctr container? The output should be similar to this: Where does group ID 50000 in supplementary groups ( groups field) come from, even though 50000 is not defined in the Pod&amp;rsquo;s manifest at all? The answer is /etc/group file in the container image. Checking the contents of /etc/group in the container image should show below: This shows that the container&amp;rsquo;s primary user 1000 belongs to the group 50000 in the last entry. Thus, the group membership defined in /etc/group in the container image for the container&amp;rsquo;s primary user is implicitly merged to the information from the Pod.</description></item><item><title>Kubernetes v1.33: Prevent PersistentVolume Leaks When Deleting out of Order graduates to GA</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-05-05-kubernetes-v1-33-prevent-persistentvolume-leaks-when-deleting-out-of-order-gradu/</link><pubDate>Mon, 05 May 2025 10:30:00 -0800</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-05-05-kubernetes-v1-33-prevent-persistentvolume-leaks-when-deleting-out-of-order-gradu/</guid><description>I am thrilled to announce that the feature to prevent PersistentVolume (or PVs for short) leaks when deleting out of order has graduated to General Availability (GA) in Kubernetes v1. 33! This improvement, initially introduced as a beta feature in Kubernetes v1. 31, ensures that your storage resources are properly reclaimed, preventing unwanted leaks. PersistentVolumeClaim (or PVC for short) is a user&amp;rsquo;s request for storage. A PV and PVC are considered Bound if a newly created PV or a matching PV is found. The PVs themselves are backed by volumes allocated by the storage backend. Normally, if the volume is to be deleted, then the expectation is to delete the PVC for a bound PV-PVC pair. However, there are no restrictions on deleting a PV before deleting a PVC. For a Bound PV-PVC pair, the ordering of PV-PVC deletion determines whether the PV reclaim policy is honored. The reclaim policy is honored if the PVC is deleted first; however, if the PV is deleted prior to deleting the PVC, then the reclaim policy is not exercised. As a result of this behavior, the associated storage asset in the external infrastructure is not removed. With the graduation to GA in Kubernetes v1.</description></item><item><title>Kubernetes v1.33: Mutable CSI Node Allocatable Count</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-05-02-kubernetes-v1-33-mutable-csi-node-allocatable-count/</link><pubDate>Fri, 02 May 2025 10:30:00 -0800</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-05-02-kubernetes-v1-33-mutable-csi-node-allocatable-count/</guid><description>Scheduling stateful applications reliably depends heavily on accurate information about resource availability on nodes.

A significant challenge with large clusters is the memory overhead caused by list requests. In the existing implementation, the kube-apiserver processes list requests by assembling the entire response in-memory before transmitting any data to the client. But what if the response body is substantial, say hundreds of megabytes? Additionally, imagine a scenario where multiple list requests flood in simultaneously, perhaps after a brief network outage. While API Priority and Fairness has proven to reasonably protect kube-apiserver from CPU overload, its impact is visibly smaller for memory protection.

&lt;p>Hey there, Kubernetes explorer! 🌟 As your Kubernetes environment grows, keeping it secure becomes more challenging, especially when dealing with multiple clusters. Imagine managing several clusters (spokes) and needing a single source of truth for all your security metrics—sounds like a big task, right? 🤔 That&amp;rsquo;s where &lt;strong>Trivy&lt;/strong>, &lt;strong>Trivy Operator&lt;/strong>, &lt;strong>OpenTelemetry&lt;/strong>, &lt;strong>Prometheus&lt;/strong>, and &lt;strong>Grafana&lt;/strong> come to the rescue.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In this guide, I’ll show you how to set up Trivy and Trivy Operator in a federated Kubernetes environment, collect vulnerability data using OpenTelemetry, and centralize it using either an in-cluster Prometheus setup or managed services like &lt;strong>Azure Monitor (for Prometheus)&lt;/strong> and &lt;strong>Grafana Cloud&lt;/strong> or &lt;strong>Azure Managed Grafana&lt;/strong>. By the end of this, you’ll have a system that monitors vulnerabilities across all your clusters from one place.

&lt;p>Kubernetes, the platform that helps you automate, scale, and manage your containerized applications, comes with a cool feature called &lt;a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/rbac/">Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)&lt;/a>. Think of RBAC as a gatekeeper that controls who can do what within your Kubernetes cluster. It’s super important because it ensures that everyone and everything (like users, applications, and services) only have the permissions they need—nothing more, nothing less.&lt;/p>

Getting this right helps keep your application available, resilient, and running smoothly. Two tools that can help you do this are &lt;strong>Pod Topology Spread Constraints&lt;/strong> and &lt;strong>Node Affinity&lt;/strong>. Let’s break these down with some easy-to-understand examples.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="1-pod-topology-spread-constraints">1. Pod Topology Spread Constraints&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Think of &lt;strong>Pod Topology Spread Constraints&lt;/strong> as a way to tell Kubernetes, &amp;ldquo;Hey, I want my Pods spread out evenly across different parts of my cluster.&amp;rdquo; This helps prevent all your Pods from ending up in the same spot, which could be a problem if that spot has an issue.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>How to Test the Latest Kubernetes Changes in Version 1.31 "Elli"</title><link>https://kubermates.org/blog/how-to-test-the-latest-kubernetes-changes-in-version-131-elli-39ec/</link><pubDate>Wed, 14 Aug 2024 21:38:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/blog/how-to-test-the-latest-kubernetes-changes-in-version-131-elli-39ec/</guid><description>&lt;p>Testing Kubernetes 1.31 &amp;ldquo;Elli&amp;rdquo; involves setting up a dedicated environment, verifying new features, validating API changes, running automated tests, and closely monitoring your cluster. Here’s a detailed guide with examples for each step.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="1-set-up-a-testing-environment">1. Set Up a Testing Environment&lt;/h2>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Create a Kubernetes Cluster&lt;/strong>:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Example&lt;/strong>: Use Minikube to create a local cluster. Run:
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" class="chroma">&lt;code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">&lt;span class="line">&lt;span class="cl">minikube start --kubernetes-version&lt;span class="o">=&lt;/span>v1.31.0
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>This command sets up a Kubernetes 1.31 cluster locally, allowing you to test the new features and changes in a controlled environment.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Cloud-Based Testing&lt;/strong>: For cloud environments, use a tool like &lt;code>eksctl&lt;/code> for Amazon EKS:
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" class="chroma">&lt;code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">&lt;span class="line">&lt;span class="cl">eksctl create cluster --version 1.31 --name test-cluster
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>This command creates an Amazon EKS cluster with Kubernetes 1.31, suitable for more extensive testing scenarios.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Isolate the Environment&lt;/strong>:&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>KubeCon + CloudNativeCon Europe 2026</title><link>https://kubermates.org/events/kubecon-eu-2026/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/events/kubecon-eu-2026/</guid><description/></item><item><title>KubeCon + CloudNativeCon North America 2026</title><link>https://kubermates.org/events/kubecon-na-2026/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/events/kubecon-na-2026/</guid><description/></item><item><title>PlatformCon 2026</title><link>https://kubermates.org/events/platformcon-2026/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/events/platformcon-2026/</guid><description/></item></channel></rss>
