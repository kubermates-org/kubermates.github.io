Containers provide integrated dependency management and enable a standard distribution and deployment model for any workload. With Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (Amazon EKS), Kubernetes has emerged as a go-to solution for customers running large-scale containerized workloads that need to efficiently scale to meet evolving needs. However, one persistent challenge continues to impact specific deployment and scaling aspects of Kubernetes workload operations. Container image pulls, particularly when working with large and complex container images, can directly impact the responsiveness and agility of your systems. With the growth of AI/ML workloads, where we see particularly large images, this directly impacts operations as images may take several minutes to pull and prepare. In our recent Under the Hood post for EKS Ultra Scale Clusters, we briefly touched on our evolving solution for this problem, Seekable OCI (SOCI) Parallel Pull. In this post, we’ll explain how container image pulls work and how they impact deployment and scaling operations, we’ll dive deeper into how SOCI parallel pull works, and finally show how it can help you improve image pull performance with your workloads on Amazon EKS. As average container image sizes have grown in recent years, container startup performance has become a critical element of modern cloud native system performance. Image pull and preparation can account for more than 75% of total startup time for new and scaling workloads. This challenge is particularly acute with the rise of AI/ML workloads on Amazon EKS. These workloads have driven significant growth in container image sizes, where images are commonly tens of gigabytes in size.</description></item><item><title>Metal3.io becomes a CNCF incubating project</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-08-27-metal3-io-becomes-a-cncf-incubating-project/</link><pubDate>Wed, 27 Aug 2025 19:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-08-27-metal3-io-becomes-a-cncf-incubating-project/</guid><description>Posted on August 27, 2025 by Metal3. io Project Maintainers CNCF projects highlighted in this post The CNCF Technical Oversight Committee (TOC) has voted to accept Metal3. io as a CNCF incubating project. Metal3. io joins a growing ecosystem of technologies tackling real-world challenges at the edge of cloud native infrastructure. The Metal3. io project (pronounced: “Metal Kubed”) provides components for bare metal host management with Kubernetes. You can enroll your bare metal machines, provision operating system images, and then, if you like, deploy Kubernetes clusters to them. From there, operating and upgrading your Kubernetes clusters can be handled by Metal3. io. Moreover, Metal3. io is itself a Kubernetes application, so it runs on Kubernetes and uses Kubernetes resources and APIs as its interface.</description></item><item><title>Refresh cluster insights</title><link>https://kubermates.org/releases/2025-08-27-refresh-cluster-insights/</link><pubDate>Wed, 27 Aug 2025 19:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/releases/2025-08-27-refresh-cluster-insights/</guid><description>Help improve this page To contribute to this user guide, choose the Edit this page on GitHub link that is located in the right pane of every page. Amazon EKS provides two types of insights: Configuration insights and Upgrade insights. Configuration insights identify misconfigurations in your EKS Hybrid Nodes setup that could impair functionality of your cluster or workloads. Upgrade insights identify issues that could impact your ability to upgrade to new versions of Kubernetes. To see the list of insight checks performed and any relevant issues that Amazon EKS has identified, you can call the look in the AWS Management Console, the AWS CLI, AWS SDKs, and Amazon EKS ListInsights API operation. Open the Amazon EKS console. From the cluster list, choose the name of the Amazon EKS cluster for which you want to see the insights. Choose Monitor cluster. Choose the Cluster health tab. In the Configuration insights table, you will see the following columns: Name â The check that was performed by Amazon EKS against the cluster. Insight status â An insight with a status of Error means that there is a misconfiguration that is likely impacting cluster functionality. An insight with a status of Warning means that the configuration doesnât match the documented approach, but that cluster functionality might work if you configured it intentionally.</description></item><item><title>Kubernetes v1.34: Of Wind &amp; Will (O' WaW)</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-08-27-kubernetes-v1-34-of-wind-will-o-waw/</link><pubDate>Wed, 27 Aug 2025 10:30:00 -0800</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-08-27-kubernetes-v1-34-of-wind-will-o-waw/</guid><description>Editors: Agustina Barbetta, Alejandro Josue Leon Bellido, Graziano Casto, Melony Qin, Dipesh Rawat Similar to previous releases, the release of Kubernetes v1. 34 introduces new stable, beta, and alpha features. The consistent delivery of high-quality releases underscores the strength of our development cycle and the vibrant support from our community. This release consists of 58 enhancements. Of those enhancements, 23 have graduated to Stable, 22 have entered Beta, and 13 have entered Alpha. There are also some deprecations and removals in this release; make sure to read about those. A release powered by the wind around us — and the will within us. Every release cycle, we inherit winds that we don&amp;rsquo;t really control — the state of our tooling, documentation, and the historical quirks of our project. Sometimes these winds fill our sails, sometimes they push us sideways or die down. What keeps Kubernetes moving isn&amp;rsquo;t the perfect winds, but the will of our sailors who adjust the sails, man the helm, chart the courses and keep the ship steady. The release happens not because conditions are always ideal, but because of the people who build it, the people who release it, and the bears ^ , cats, dogs, wizards, and curious minds who keep Kubernetes sailing strong — no matter which way the wind blows. This release, Of Wind &amp;amp; Will (O&amp;rsquo; WaW) , honors the winds that have shaped us, and the will that propels us forward.</description></item><item><title>Pre-release v2.9.11-rc1</title><link>https://kubermates.org/releases/2025-08-27-pre-release-v2-9-11-rc1/</link><pubDate>Wed, 27 Aug 2025 17:32:18 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/releases/2025-08-27-pre-release-v2-9-11-rc1/</guid><description>There was an error while loading.

While a variety of high level tools like Large Language Models (LLMs) already exist to support generic use cases, many domain specific solutions are either not yet available or come with significant development costs and risks, particularly when targeting more niche problems. This raises an important challenge: how can we avoid building a fragmented AI tooling landscape with limited real world applicability? To truly support the next wave of AI innovation, especially in cloud native environments, we need to rethink and reinforce our software component foundation. This includes standardizing formats, improving cross platform interoperability, and evolving Kubernetes with AI native features in mind. One of the most promising developments in this space revolves around Open Container Initiative (OCI) artifacts. OCI artifacts enable users to store and distribute arbitrary files and metadata using OCI compliant container registries. While originally used for generic purposes (like ORAS supports them), they’re now finding critical roles in AI/ML workflows, especially with the rise of specifications like the CNCF ModelPack. The CNCF ModelPack Specification builds on top of OCI artifacts and aims to standardize the packaging, distribution, and execution of AI models in cloud native environments. By moving away from proprietary formats, ModelPack facilitates reproducibility, portability, and vendor neutrality in machine learning workflows. This opens the door to several important use cases: Having standards around OCI artifacts are essential for building robust AI features into Kubernetes. For example, the Kubernetes Image Volume feature allows pods to mount container image layers as read-only volumes. Image volumes could also support OCI artifacts as a special use case.</description></item><item><title>Simplify Linux management across your systems’ lifecycles with Red Hat Insights</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-08-27-simplify-linux-management-across-your-systems-lifecycles-with-red-hat-insights/</link><pubDate>Wed, 27 Aug 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-08-27-simplify-linux-management-across-your-systems-lifecycles-with-red-hat-insights/</guid><description>Share As a system administrator, keeping a Linux fleet running efficiently and securely can feel like you’re constantly putting out fires. Just when you address one issue, another one pops up, often because of a lack of visibility across your environment and too many manual, repetitive tasks. But what if you could spend less time reacting to problems and more time on the work that drives your business forward? That&amp;rsquo;s why we&amp;rsquo;re committed to building and improving new capabilities in Red Hat Insights for Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) to help you stay ahead of the curve. Insights for RHEL helps you proactively manage your environment across the entire system lifecycle. With exciting new features – some you may have already heard about at Red Hat Summit this past May - you can make better decisions, access targeted information when you need it, and automate repetitive tasks to increase efficiency. Planning for new systems can be difficult when you don&amp;rsquo;t have a clear, centralized view of the future. The new Insights planning for RHEL capability provides a centralized view of future roadmap details, package lifecycle information, and deprecations. This helps you proactively plan system builds, anticipate potential impacts of updates, and align your infrastructure with your long-term strategy. You can build new images with confidence, avoiding last-minute scrambling and unexpected issues. We&amp;rsquo;re also making it easier to create more complete and functional images with package recommendations in image builder. This new feature provides proactive package recommendations based on user inputs and real-world usage patterns, helping you discover valuable components you might otherwise overlook. This is like having a second set of eyes on your work, helping to minimize post-deployment headaches.</description></item><item><title>v1.33.4+rke2r1</title><link>https://kubermates.org/releases/2025-08-26-v1-33-4-rke2r1/</link><pubDate>Tue, 26 Aug 2025 23:04:44 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/releases/2025-08-26-v1-33-4-rke2r1/</guid><description>This release updates Kubernetes to v1. 33. 4.

An AWS managed policy is a standalone policy that is created and administered by AWS. AWS managed policies are designed to provide permissions for many common use cases so that you can start assigning permissions to users, groups, and roles. Keep in mind that AWS managed policies might not grant least-privilege permissions for your specific use cases because theyâre available for all AWS customers to use. We recommend that you reduce permissions further by defining customer managed policies that are specific to your use cases. You cannot change the permissions defined in AWS managed policies. If AWS updates the permissions defined in an AWS managed policy, the update affects all principal identities (users, groups, and roles) that the policy is attached to. AWS is most likely to update an AWS managed policy when a new AWS service is launched or new API operations become available for existing services. For more information, see AWS managed policies in the IAM User Guide. You can attach the AmazonEKS_CNI_Policy to your IAM entities. Before you create an Amazon EC2 node group, this policy must be attached to either the node IAM role , or to an IAM role thatâs used specifically by the Amazon VPC CNI plugin for Kubernetes. This is so that it can perform actions on your behalf.</description></item><item><title>v1.31.12+k3s1</title><link>https://kubermates.org/releases/2025-08-26-v1-31-12-k3s1/</link><pubDate>Tue, 26 Aug 2025 18:58:55 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/releases/2025-08-26-v1-31-12-k3s1/</guid><description>This release updates Kubernetes to v1. 31. 12, and fixes a number of issues.

This allows you to easily leverage the power of Envoy’s L7 capabilities for Ingress and east-west traffic in your mesh with easy-to-use CRDs. To understand how this integration works, let’s first take a quick look at Ambient Mesh itself. Also known as Istio Ambient mode , it’s a sidecar-less service mesh architecture that aims to simplify deployments and can boost efficiency for specific use cases. Unlike sidecar-based meshes, Ambient splits the data plane into two key components: the ztunnel , which secures service-to-service communication, and the Waypoint Proxy , which handles Layer 7 traffic routing and policy enforcement. On the other side, Envoy Gateway is a Kubernetes-native API gateway built on top of Envoy Proxy. It’s designed to work seamlessly with the Kubernetes Gateway API and takes a batteries-included approach—offering built-in support for authentication, authorization, rate limiting, CORS handling, header manipulation, and more. These capabilities are exposed through familiar Kubernetes-style APIs, letting you fully tap into Envoy’s power without needing complex configurations. Because both Ambient Mesh and Envoy Gateway are built on top of Envoy, they share a common foundation. This makes integration straightforward and allows Envoy Gateway to act as both the Ingress Gateway and Waypoint Proxy —giving you a consistent and powerful way to manage traffic and apply Layer 7 policies across your mesh. While Ambient Mesh simplifies service mesh operations by removing sidecars, its feature set doesn’t yet match the maturity of the sidecar-based model. Some advanced Layer 7 capabilities are either missing, considered experimental, or require extra complexity to configure in native Ambient mode.</description></item><item><title>Broadcom and Canonical Partner to Fast-track and Secure Containerized Workload Deployments on VMware Cloud Foundation</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-08-26-broadcom-and-canonical-partner-to-fast-track-and-secure-containerized-workload-d/</link><pubDate>Tue, 26 Aug 2025 12:35:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-08-26-broadcom-and-canonical-partner-to-fast-track-and-secure-containerized-workload-d/</guid><description>A survey on the State of Developers found that most developers spend roughly one day each week tackling development and IT inefficiencies 1.

In this blog, we’ll take a step behind the curtain to see how these capabilities are running in VCF, using AI features that our customers can also use to build their own AI experiences with their own private data. VMware Private AI services enable administrators to safely and securely import and share approved AI models (Model Gallery and Model Governance); scale and run Models as a Service for their organization (Model Runtime and ML API gateway); create Knowledge bases and regularly refresh data in a fully supported vector database for creating RAG applications (Data Indexing and Retrieval Service in partnership with Data Services Manager); and provide developers a UI where they can compose models, knowledge bases, and tools together to create Agents (Agent Builder). The Intelligent Assist service is using these capabilities to run the Intelligent Assist agent, and VCF engineering teams are using these services as a common AI platform to deliver joint services and AI workflows. Customers can also use these same capabilities for their own teams. These features give private cloud administrators what they need to safely download, validate, and share models with teams across their cloud. Learn about how to safely onboard popular models from upstream and ensure the model’s behavior meets your enterprises’ expectations and requirements – and behavior doesn’t drift over time in this blog post. Now that you have models securely imported and shared with the right folks in your organization, you will want to run them in an efficient and scalable way. Gone are the days of every division running their own separate copies of the same popular models – instead your team can provide Models as a Service using the Model Runtime. Deploy models on a fully maintained runtime stack from directly within VCF, and then horizontally scale them as they come under load with no end user impact, as users broker their requests via the ML API gateway. This also gives you flexibility to do rolling upgrades of models with zero end user impact. This method of deploying models allows separate lines of business or tenants within a Cloud Service Provider to keep their data separate from each other while ensuring high GPU utilization.</description></item><item><title>Engineering the Next Generation of VMware Cloud Foundation</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-08-26-engineering-the-next-generation-of-vmware-cloud-foundation/</link><pubDate>Tue, 26 Aug 2025 12:30:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-08-26-engineering-the-next-generation-of-vmware-cloud-foundation/</guid><description>The private cloud is entering a new era.

The ever-evolving risks presented by today’s modern threat landscape pose unprecedented challenges that most today are ill-equipped to address. With ransomware attacks becoming increasingly sophisticated and regulatory guidelines more stringent, cyber-risk management and compliance lie at the core of every strategic IT decision made by C-Suite executives and board members. 51% of leaders reported security, data protection and privacy as key priorities to enable compliant operations 1. However, the path to achieve successful outcomes is beset with obstacles. Why Organizations Struggle to Manage Cyber-Risk and Maintain Compliance Reactive vs. Proactive Response: data is scattered across different applications in multiple geographic locations, each with its own rules and regulations. 63% of organizations report that complexity from the disaggregated nature of data as the main challenge to maintain compliance 2. Policy monitoring for virtual machines (VMs), containers, databases, infrastructure and technology stack components is siloed, which hinders early detection of drifts and leads to a reactive versus proactive response. Manual Remediation and Recovery: policy management and recovery lack automation, which directly impacts an organization’s ability to scale operations and preserve compliance as applications are changed, moved or deleted. Intense manual intervention inevitably delays time to audit-readiness and leaves unaddressed gaps that could expose critical workloads to increased damage. Stitching of Multiple Tools: consolidation of cyber-risk management, resilience and recovery is easier said than done. Most organizations rely on a piecemeal approach, plagued with operational complexity and inefficiencies that increase chances of human error.</description></item><item><title>Unleashing the Power of Private AI: New Innovations from Broadcom with NVIDIA</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-08-26-unleashing-the-power-of-private-ai-new-innovations-from-broadcom-with-nvidia/</link><pubDate>Tue, 26 Aug 2025 12:30:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-08-26-unleashing-the-power-of-private-ai-new-innovations-from-broadcom-with-nvidia/</guid><description>Enterprises can get tremendous productivity and business transformation from AI.

A significant challenge for telecommunication (telco) service providers is the management of different software versions of these network functions, especially in a multivendor environment. A particular version may include new features, bug fixes, or require specific configurations. Consequently, testing of the network functions is complex, going beyond the verification of each component&amp;rsquo;s functionality to ensure that various versions of these network functions can interoperate. Dealing with this complexity necessitates extensive testing automation to guarantee streamlined operations across the service provider’s network. Adopting a cloud-native design for the 5G core gives service providers a competitive edge in building networks that easily scale and adapt. A distributed and disaggregated 5G core network introduces additional challenges, particularly around ensuring that all the different components can work together. As 5G core cloud-native network functions (CNFs) are made up of microservices that are constantly being updated and deployed in a dynamic environment, keeping tabs on security and adherence to standards becomes an overwhelming task. To ensure that all independently developed components of the 5G core operate effectively, the various network functions within the 5G core must interoperate efficiently, adhering to 3GPP standards. Still, as each 5G core vendor implements their microservices slightly differently, rigorous testing of these interactions is crucial. To ensure robustness and performance, the 5G core needs to be tested at different levels: Red Hat and Rebaca have collaborated to produce an autonomous continuous testing framework to address the challenges outlined with 5G core lifecycle management. The framework is engineered to facilitate the consistent delivery of compliant and interoperable 5G core CNFs.</description></item><item><title>What’s New in Calico – Summer 2025</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-08-25-what-s-new-in-calico-summer-2025/</link><pubDate>Mon, 25 Aug 2025 22:17:49 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-08-25-what-s-new-in-calico-summer-2025/</guid><description>As Kubernetes adoption scales across enterprise architectures, platform architects face mounting pressure to implement consistent security guardrails across distributed, multi-cluster environments while maintaining operational velocity. Modern infrastructure demands a security architecture that can adapt without introducing complexity or performance penalties. Traditional approaches force architects to cobble together separate solutions for ingress protection, network policies, and application-layer security, creating operational friction and increasing attack surface. Today, we’re announcing significant enhancements to Calico that eliminate this architectural complexity. This release introduces native Web Application Firewall (WAF) capabilities integrated directly into Calico’s Ingress Gateway, enabling platform architects to deploy a single technology stack for both ingress management and HTTP-layer threat protection. Combined with enhanced Role-Based Access Controls (RBAC) controls, and centralized observability across heterogeneous workloads, platform architects can now design and implement comprehensive security all within a unified platform. The new features in this release can be grouped under two main categories: Ingress traffic into a Kubernetes cluster is a common entry point for attacks, so it’s critical to inspect and proactively secure it. Since clusters often receive traffic directly from the public internet, analyzing application-layer protocols like HTTP and gRPC for threats is a fundamental security requirement. While there are options to deploy a standalone Web Application Firewall (WAF) with your ingress controller, using an integrated WAF simplifies operations and can reduce both complexity and cost. Calico Ingress Gateway , our implementation of the Kubernetes Gateway API, now includes a built-in WAF that allows you to inspect, authorize, and secure ingress traffic at runtime. The WAF that is integrated with Ingress Gateway is the same as the one used in Calico’s workload-based WAF , giving you consistent threat detection across both ingress points and internal services. With this built-in WAF, you can define and enforce security rules directly within the Ingress Gateway, enabling deep inspection of HTTP and gRPC traffic and blocking known threats before they reach your workloads.</description></item><item><title>Pre-release v2.11.5-alpha3</title><link>https://kubermates.org/releases/2025-08-25-pre-release-v2-11-5-alpha3/</link><pubDate>Mon, 25 Aug 2025 22:02:52 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/releases/2025-08-25-pre-release-v2-11-5-alpha3/</guid><description>There was an error while loading.

My project focused on understanding how Prometheus handles OpenTelemetry resource attributes and how that experience could be improved for users. My job was to conduct user research to get the user perspective on this challenge. In three months, I conducted user and stakeholder interviews, ran a survey, and analyzed the findings. In this article, I’ll share how I conducted the research, what I uncovered and where the communities involved could go from here. OpenTelemetry (OTel) has something called a resource attribute, which is extra information about the source of a metric, like the service, host, or environment that generated it. Prometheus, a time-series database, uses labels to identify and query metrics. If resource attributes are converted to labels, they can cause what’s known as “a cardinality explosion”, essentially creating too many unique combinations that overwhelm the system. This usually happens if the attributes change often or include a lot of unique values, like user IDs or pod names. Currently, there are three main approaches to handling this challenge: These aren’t bad solutions technically, but they don’t provide the best user experience. So, I conducted this research to understand what the Prometheus maintainers might be missing about the user experience. The research objectives were: My research approach was a mix of qualitative and quantitative research.</description></item><item><title>4.20.0-okd-scos.ec.13</title><link>https://kubermates.org/releases/2025-08-25-4-20-0-okd-scos-ec-13/</link><pubDate>Mon, 25 Aug 2025 07:54:47 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/releases/2025-08-25-4-20-0-okd-scos-ec-13/</guid><description>These archives contain the client tooling for OKD on CentOS Stream CoreOS.

Military organizations are increasingly operating across a hybrid infrastructure, spanning the strategic core, deployed edge, and tactical edge, while maintaining absolute control over their systems. However, this evolution presents significant challenges, from siloed technologies to cybersecurity threats. Defence organizations must navigate these obstacles by adopting a unified platform approach, leveraging an open framework based on open standards to strengthen autonomy, security, and seamless operations across all environments. Traditionally, defence operations began in the strategic core, which were large, on-premise data centers disconnected from the internet. These handled everything from mission planning to logistics. The first wave of transformation introduced private cloud solutions, allowing military organizations to scale infrastructure dynamically while maintaining digital sovereignty. Many defence entities remain cautious about using the public cloud due to security concerns, opting instead for air-gapped private clouds—physically isolated environments within their facilities—so only screened personnel and verified secure networks have access. Today, the focus has shifted to edge computing, highlighting the need for smarter, real-time, and autonomous decision-making in the field. Defence organizations now operate across two key edge environments, the deployed edge and the tactical edge. The deployed edge consists of mini data centres, capable of running mission-critical applications, processing intelligence and supporting AI workloads. Meanwhile, the tactical edge encompasses lightweight, ruggedized devices such as drones, autonomous vehicles, and soldier-worn systems that can collect, analyse, and act on data in real time, often completely disconnected from central networks.</description></item><item><title>How I Team Up with GenAI to Craft Conference Talk Proposals</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-08-22-how-i-team-up-with-genai-to-craft-conference-talk-proposals/</link><pubDate>Fri, 22 Aug 2025 20:09:07 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-08-22-how-i-team-up-with-genai-to-craft-conference-talk-proposals/</guid><description>Posted on August 22, 2025 by Whitney Lee, CNCF Ambassador and Senior Technical Advocate at Datadog TL;DR: GenAI can help you write conference abstracts, but if you use it without injecting your own curiosity and humanness, reviewers can tell. This post walks through my personal process for co-writing abstracts with GenAI in a way that preserves my voice and experience. I developed this process for technical talks, but it adapts well to other formats too. I’ve spoken at a lot of conferences, big and small. I’ve given keynotes. Breakouts. Workshops. I’ve been around the block and written many conference talk proposals. I’ve also been on program committees and reviewed others’ proposals. There’s always room for improvement, but I like to think I know what good is. In my view, here are some elements of a good talk proposal: – A clear, engaging idea (or a run-of-the-mill idea with a compelling angle) – Some clear details about the talk, like concrete examples or stories, or talk format and tools covered – Clear audience – Clear takeaways As you can imagine, the widespread use of GenAI to generate talk proposals has changed the game for both submitters and reviewers. As a submitter, you can type just one line into ChatGPT, for example: Write me a KubeCon + CloudNativeCon talk abstract on Validating Admission Policy And it produces something that, on the surface, looks pretty good!* Title: Enforcing What Matters: Building Safer Kubernetes with Validating Admission Policies Abstract: As Kubernetes adoption continues to grow across organizations, ensuring workloads meet security, compliance, and operational standards before hitting the cluster is more critical than ever.</description></item><item><title>Pre-release v2.9.11-alpha3</title><link>https://kubermates.org/releases/2025-08-22-pre-release-v2-9-11-alpha3/</link><pubDate>Fri, 22 Aug 2025 19:25:24 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/releases/2025-08-22-pre-release-v2-9-11-alpha3/</guid><description>There was an error while loading.

The assessment phase involves evaluating technical feasibility for Amazon EKS workloads, analyzing current Kubernetes environments, identifying compatibility issues, estimating costs, and determining timelines with business impact considerations. During the mobilize phase, organizations create detailed migration plans, establish EKS environments with proper networking and security, train teams, and develop testing procedures. The final migrate and modernize phase involves transferring applications and data, validating functionality, implementing cloud-centered features, optimizing resources and costs, and enhancing observability to fully use AWS capabilities. One of the most significant challenges organizations face during the process is cost estimation, which happens in the assessment phase. Karpenter is an open source Kubernetes node autoscaler that efficiently provisions just-in-time compute resources to match workload demands. Unlike traditional autoscalers, Karpenter directly integrates with cloud providers to make intelligent, real-time decisions about instance types, availability zones, and capacity options. It evaluates pod requirements and constraints to select optimal instances, considering factors such as CPU, memory, price, and availability. Karpenter can consolidate workloads for cost efficiency and rapidly scale from zero to handle sudden demand spikes. It supports both spot and on-demand instances, and automatically terminates nodes when they’re no longer needed, optimizing cluster resource utilization and reducing cloud costs. Karpenter uses the concept of Providers to interact with different infrastructure platforms for provisioning and managing compute resources. KWOK (Kubernetes WithOut Kubelet) is a toolkit that simulates data plane nodes without allocating actual infrastructure, and can be used as a provider to create lightweight testing environments that enable developers to validate provisioning decisions, try various (virtual) instance types, and debug scaling behaviors.</description></item><item><title>v1.31.12-rc5+rke2r1</title><link>https://kubermates.org/releases/2025-08-21-v1-31-12-rc5-rke2r1/</link><pubDate>Thu, 21 Aug 2025 16:20:55 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/releases/2025-08-21-v1-31-12-rc5-rke2r1/</guid><description>There was an error while loading.

However, many enterprises struggle to move beyond initial experiments to widespread and scalable implementations. This article examines 6 common obstacles to enterprise AI adoption —as highlighted in this Harvard Business Review report —and how Red Hat can help you overcome them. Many organizations initiate gen AI projects without a defined strategy or roadmap. This can lead to fragmented efforts that make it difficult to demonstrate a return on investment (ROI). A well-articulated strategy is crucial for successful adoption. You may also find your organization struggling to align AI solutions with specific, impactful business use cases. Demonstrating clear business value can often be a challenge. How Red Hat helps: A global shortage of skilled AI talent is a growing problem. This isn&amp;rsquo;t just a bottleneck—it can prevent your organization from fully harnessing AI&amp;rsquo;s transformative potential. Addressing this gap requires strategies for developing both future and current workforces. How Red Hat helps: Many existing IT and data infrastructures are unprepared for gen AI integration.</description></item><item><title>Red Hat: a leader in driving sustainability efforts within the IT industry</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-08-21-red-hat-a-leader-in-driving-sustainability-efforts-within-the-it-industry/</link><pubDate>Thu, 21 Aug 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-08-21-red-hat-a-leader-in-driving-sustainability-efforts-within-the-it-industry/</guid><description>Share Red Hat makes it a strategic priority to offer energy-efficient products, addressing the growing demand of our customers for sustainable IT solutions. Our efforts are driven by minimizing the increase in energy consumption of AI, cloud computing, and IT infrastructure. Red Hat focuses on open source technologies designed to improve energy efficiency across IT environments. This includes: InstructLab is an open source project that enhances large language models (LLMs) used in generative AI (gen AI), upgrading an LLM with less human input and fewer resources than retraining. One of the key aspects of InstructLab is its focus on smaller, fine-tuned language models. This approach directly translates to improved energy efficiency compared to larger, more resource-intensive LLMs deployed by competitors. Smaller language models require significantly less computational power for training and inference, leading to reduced energy consumption. InstructLab optimizes performance by tailoring SLMs to specific tasks or domains, enhancing efficiency, minimizing wasteful energy, and enabling models to run on lower-power CPUs as opposed to power-hungry GPUs. This lower energy consumption results in reduced operational costs, providing both financial benefits and support for sustainability goals. Red Hat&amp;rsquo;s energy-efficient solutions offer significant benefits for enterprises, from reducing operational costs to helping achieve ambitious sustainability targets. By optimizing resource utilization and enhancing performance, these solutions also provide a crucial competitive advantage in today&amp;rsquo;s market, which include: Red Hat and SoftBank have collaborate d on Artificial Intelligence Radio Access Network (AI-RAN) to optimize power consumption in datacenters powering AI applications and vRAN. This project integrates Kepler, an open source project founded at Red Hat, into SoftBank&amp;rsquo;s AI and Telecom Radio Access System (AITRAS) platform.</description></item><item><title>Honoring Styra’s Contributions To OPA</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-08-20-honoring-styra-s-contributions-to-opa/</link><pubDate>Wed, 20 Aug 2025 23:03:50 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-08-20-honoring-styra-s-contributions-to-opa/</guid><description>As the creator of Open Policy Agent (OPA), Styra has played an extraordinary role in shaping the Policy as Code (PaC) movement and advancing cloud-native security and governance. This week, the founders and core team behind Styra announced that they are joining Apple. I first met the Styra team at KubeCon 2017 in Austin, when Brian Grant saw an early demo of what we were building, and suggested that I talk to them. Although we have significantly different approaches to PaC, one of my favorite moments at each KubeCon since has been catching up with folks from Styra and exchanging notes on the space. We here at Nirmata, want to take a moment to recognize and thank the entire Styra team – their founders Teemu, Tim, Torin, along with Anders, Charlie and many others – for their pioneering work. Without their vision and drive, there would be no PaC ecosystem as we know it today. At Nirmata, we know that Kyverno’s journey, and our own, would not have been possible without the foundation laid by the OPA community. The early adoption of OPA proved the need for declarative policies and automated governance. It set the standard for how organizations think about declarative policies across cloud and infrastructure environments and it will continue to play an important role in the CNCF landscape. We are also encouraged that the Styra team has found a great home at Apple. With such a strong technology leader supporting them, the OPA community can look forward to ongoing innovation, stability, and new opportunities for growth. We are excited to see what comes next in the OPA roadmap and how the project continues to evolve as a critical part of the cloud native landscape.</description></item><item><title>Kubernetes v1.34.0-rc.2</title><link>https://kubermates.org/releases/2025-08-20-kubernetes-v1-34-0-rc-2/</link><pubDate>Wed, 20 Aug 2025 21:15:15 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/releases/2025-08-20-kubernetes-v1-34-0-rc-2/</guid><description>See kubernetes-announce@.

If you&amp;rsquo;re moving from a colo that someone manages to VMware, the cloud, or a different VMware data center, they all look and feel different. Even if you&amp;rsquo;re using the same virtualization provider, storage is probably handled differently. There has to be a lot of planning and strategy around how to copy data from one area to another since that’s not something natively built into your virtualization provider. You also have to figure out networking, DNS, routing, etc. With Red Hat OpenShift , all of these components are software-defined. You get software-defined DNS, networking, and storage layers all because it’s based on Kubernetes. Out-of-the-box OpenShift won’t “automagically” failover without additional levels of configuration, much like VMware or other traditional infrastructure environments. But the tools required are mostly there for you, either pre-packaged and open-source or robustly tested and a standard in the space. You can set up OpenShift in any environment because the least common denominator for everything, no matter where you are (bare metal or virtual), is the operating system This is where OpenShift lives. That’s why it is the perfect tool for building a truly agile infrastructure that can move freely between environments, providing instantaneous disaster recovery for businesses. There are different benefits of infrastructure agility.</description></item><item><title>Cross-service confused deputy prevention</title><link>https://kubermates.org/releases/2025-08-19-cross-service-confused-deputy-prevention/</link><pubDate>Tue, 19 Aug 2025 19:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/releases/2025-08-19-cross-service-confused-deputy-prevention/</guid><description>Help improve this page To contribute to this user guide, choose the Edit this page on GitHub link that is located in the right pane of every page. The confused deputy problem is a security issue where an entity that doesnât have permission to perform an action can coerce a more-privileged entity to perform the action. In AWS, cross-service impersonation can result in the confused deputy problem. Cross-service impersonation can occur when one service (the calling service ) calls another service (the called service ). The calling service can be manipulated to use its permissions to act on another customerâs resources in a way it should not otherwise have permission to access. To prevent this, AWS provides tools that help you protect your data for all services with service principals that have been given access to resources in your account. We recommend using the aws:SourceArn , aws:SourceAccount global condition context keys in resource policies to limit the permissions that Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (Amazon EKS) gives another service to the resource. Use aws:SourceArn to associate only one resource with cross-service access. Use aws:SourceAccount to let any resource in that account be associated with the cross-service use. The most effective way to protect against the confused deputy problem is to use the aws:SourceArn global condition context key with the full ARN of the resource. If you donât know the full ARN of the resource or if you are specifying multiple resources, use the aws:SourceArn global context condition key with wildcard characters (&lt;em&gt;) for the unknown portions of the ARN. For example, arn:aws:&lt;servicename&gt;:&lt;/em&gt;:&amp;lt;123456789012&amp;gt;:*.</description></item><item><title>Tuning Linux Swap for Kubernetes: A Deep Dive</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-08-19-tuning-linux-swap-for-kubernetes-a-deep-dive/</link><pubDate>Tue, 19 Aug 2025 10:30:00 -0800</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-08-19-tuning-linux-swap-for-kubernetes-a-deep-dive/</guid><description>The Kubernetes NodeSwap feature , likely to graduate to stable in the upcoming Kubernetes v1. 34 release, allows swap usage: a significant shift from the conventional practice of disabling swap for performance predictability. This article focuses exclusively on tuning swap on Linux nodes, where this feature is available. By allowing Linux nodes to use secondary storage for additional virtual memory when physical RAM is exhausted, node swap support aims to improve resource utilization and reduce out-of-memory (OOM) kills. However, enabling swap is not a &amp;ldquo;turn-key&amp;rdquo; solution. The performance and stability of your nodes under memory pressure are critically dependent on a set of Linux kernel parameters. Misconfiguration can lead to performance degradation and interfere with Kubelet&amp;rsquo;s eviction logic. In this blogpost, I&amp;rsquo;ll dive into critical Linux kernel parameters that govern swap behavior. I will explore how these parameters influence Kubernetes workload performance, swap utilization, and crucial eviction mechanisms. I will present various test results showcasing the impact of different configurations, and share my findings on achieving optimal settings for stable and high-performing Kubernetes clusters. At a high level, the Linux kernel manages memory through pages, typically 4KiB in size. When physical memory becomes constrained, the kernel&amp;rsquo;s page replacement algorithm decides which pages to move to swap space.</description></item><item><title>Introducing langchain-gradient: Seamless LangChain Integration with DigitalOcean Gradient™ AI Platform</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-08-19-introducing-langchain-gradient-seamless-langchain-integration-with-digitalocean-/</link><pubDate>Tue, 19 Aug 2025 17:37:45 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-08-19-introducing-langchain-gradient-seamless-langchain-integration-with-digitalocean-/</guid><description>By Narasimha Badrinath Weâre excited to introduce langchain-gradient , a new open-source integration that brings the power of LangChain to DigitalOcean Gradient AI Platform.

This matters because while GenAI can generate content, ideas, or responses, it can’t act on them. However, when combined with Agentic AI, your systems shift from being reactive and prompt-driven to autonomous and outcome-oriented. This article aims to help senior technology leaders better understand the value Agentic AI can add to existing AI infrastructure, while outlining key considerations to determine whether its implementation aligns with your business needs. Image caption: Core components of an Agentic AI Architecture from Markovate. Agentic AI systems are designed to operate autonomously, perceiving their environment, making decisions, and executing actions without continuous human oversight. This autonomy enables businesses to streamline operations, reduce costs, and enhance scalability. The image above illustrates how the following systems function: Ultimately, Agentic AI systems are equipped with learning mechanisms that improve over time. Through techniques like reinforcement learning, where the system learns from the outcomes of its actions, and supervised or unsupervised learning, where it identifies patterns in data, the AI adapts to new situations and refines its decision-making processes. The most disruptive AI solutions over the next few years will combine GenAI with Agentic AI, and the key to achieving better business outcomes is knowing when to use one, the other, or both. Not every use case requires a full agentic system, but many businesses will be surprised at how many should. GenAI alone: GenAI excels at generating new content from existing data patterns, significantly boosting creativity and productivity across various domains.</description></item><item><title>Gear Up for the 5th Annual KCD Washington DC!</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-08-16-gear-up-for-the-5th-annual-kcd-washington-dc/</link><pubDate>Sat, 16 Aug 2025 13:04:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-08-16-gear-up-for-the-5th-annual-kcd-washington-dc/</guid><description>Posted on August 16, 2025 by Matthew Cascio, CNCF Ambassador and KCD Washington DC Organizer We’re so thrilled to be organizing another year of cloud native community in the Nation’s Capital.

As a Senior Manager of Solutions Architecture, he helps customers build smarter, more scalable cloud solutions. Darian has seen how DigitalOcean has grown to serve more complex workloads for digital native enterprises, while staying true to its roots as a developer-friendly cloud. For Darian, the answer is simple: the people and the culture that bring them together. âI think youâll hear this from just about anyone at DigitalOcean, the people are what make this place special. Not only do I get to work with extremely talented folks, but everyone genuinely enjoys being here. That creates an environment and culture thatâs really pleasant to be a part of. â Itâs this mix of collaboration, shared passion, and a love for the work that keeps Darian energized after nearly a decade at DO. ð¥ Have a look at Darian Wilkinâs full conversation â¬ï¸ âI like to think of our team as the lubricant in the gears that keep things moving when businesses are adopting cloud technologies. We meet with customers one-on-one to help them design robust, fault-tolerant, and performant architectures, while keeping costs in check. If our customers canât expand their cloud presence in a reliable and cost-effective way, their business is going to struggle. So they rely on us for best practices and forward-looking advice on how to get better in the cloud.</description></item><item><title>Kubernetes v1.31.12</title><link>https://kubermates.org/releases/2025-08-13-kubernetes-v1-31-12/</link><pubDate>Wed, 13 Aug 2025 19:50:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/releases/2025-08-13-kubernetes-v1-31-12/</guid><description>See kubernetes-announce@.

Progressive delivery strategies, such as canary deployments, allow organizations to release new features by shifting traffic incrementally between old and new versions of a service. This allows organizations to first release features to a small subset of users, monitor system behavior and performance in real time, and automatically roll back if anomalies are detected. This is particularly valuable in modern microservices environments running on platforms such as Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (Amazon EKS) , where service meshes and traffic routers provide the necessary infrastructure for fine-grained control over traffic routing. This post explores an architectural approach to implementing progressive delivery using Amazon VPC Lattice, Amazon CloudWatch Synthetics , and Argo Rollouts. The solution uses VPC Lattice for enhanced traffic control across microservices, CloudWatch Synthetics for real-time health and validation monitoring, and Argo Rollouts for orchestrating canary updates. The content in this post addresses readers who are already familiar with networking constructs on Amazon Web Services (AWS), such as Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon VPC) , CloudWatch Synthetics and Amazon EKS. Instead of defining these services, we focus on their capabilities and integration with VPC Lattice. We also build upon your existing understanding of VPC Lattice concepts and Argo Rollouts.

To simplify Kubernetes management and troubleshooting, we&amp;rsquo;re thrilled to introduce Headlamp AI Assistant : a powerful new plugin for Headlamp that helps you understand and operate your Kubernetes clusters and applications with greater clarity and ease. Whether you&amp;rsquo;re a seasoned engineer or just getting started, the AI Assistant offers: Here is a demo of the AI Assistant in action as it helps troubleshoot an application running with issues in a Kubernetes cluster: Large Language Models (LLMs) have transformed not just how we access data but also how we interact with it. The rise of tools like ChatGPT opened a world of possibilities, inspiring a wave of new applications. Asking questions or giving commands in natural language is intuitive, especially for users who aren&amp;rsquo;t deeply technical. Now everyone can quickly ask how to do X or Y, without feeling awkward or having to traverse pages and pages of documentation like before. Therefore, Headlamp AI Assistant brings a conversational UI to Headlamp , powered by LLMs that Headlamp users can configure with their own API keys. It is available as a Headlamp plugin, making it easy to integrate into your existing setup. Users can enable it by installing the plugin and configuring it with their own LLM API keys, giving them control over which model powers the assistant. Once enabled, the assistant becomes part of the Headlamp UI, ready to respond to contextual queries and perform actions directly from the interface. As expected, the AI Assistant is focused on helping users with Kubernetes concepts. Yet, while there is a lot of value in responding to Kubernetes related questions from Headlamp&amp;rsquo;s UI, we believe that the great benefit of such an integration is when it can use the context of what the user is experiencing in an application.</description></item><item><title>Red Hat Named a Leader in 2025 Gartner® Magic Quadrant™ for Cloud-Native Application Platforms for the Second Consecutive Year</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-08-07-red-hat-named-a-leader-in-2025-gartner-magic-quadrant-for-cloud-native-applicati/</link><pubDate>Thu, 07 Aug 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-08-07-red-hat-named-a-leader-in-2025-gartner-magic-quadrant-for-cloud-native-applicati/</guid><description>Share This week we announced that Red Hat has been positioned as a Leader for the second year in a row in the 2025 Gartner® Magic Quadrant™ for Cloud-Native Application Platforms.

Source: Gartner, “Magic Quadrant for Cloud-Native Application Platforms,” August 2025 To help further explain the evaluation of the Gartner Magic Quadrant from our point of view, we’re answering some of the most frequently asked questions. “Magic Quadrant reports are a culmination of rigorous, fact-based research in specific markets, providing a wide-angle view of the relative positions of the providers in markets where growth is high and provider differentiation is distinct. Providers are positioned into four quadrants: Leaders, Challengers, Visionaries and Niche Players. The research enables you to get the most from market analysis in alignment with your unique business and technology needs. ” “Gartner defines cloud-native application platforms as those that provide managed application runtime environments for applications and integrated capabilities to manage the life cycle of an application or application component. They typically enable distributed application deployments and support cloud style operations — such as elasticity, multitenancy and self-service — without requiring the development team to provision infrastructure or manage containers. Cloud-native application platforms are designed to facilitate the deployment, runtime execution, and management of modern cloud-native or cloud-optimized applications without the need to manage any underlying infrastructure. Also, they are designed to enhance developer productivity, accelerate development and deployment cycles, and increase operational effectiveness by making it easier to scale on demand. Cloud-native application platforms offer a structured execution environment for applications, effectively hiding the complexities of the underlying infrastructure and computing resources.</description></item><item><title>Top 10 articles Red Hat customers are reading right now</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-08-07-top-10-articles-red-hat-customers-are-reading-right-now/</link><pubDate>Thu, 07 Aug 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-08-07-top-10-articles-red-hat-customers-are-reading-right-now/</guid><description>Share Staying on top of the latest advancements in open source technology is more critical than ever.

In this post, we guide you through integrating Tailscale with your Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS) Hybrid Nodes environment. Amazon EKS Hybrid Nodes is a feature of Amazon EKS that enables you to streamline your Kubernetes management by connecting on-premises and edge infrastructure to an EKS cluster running in Amazon Web Services (AWS). This unified approach allows AWS to manage the Kubernetes control plane in the cloud while you maintain your hybrid nodes in on-premises or edge locations. We demonstrate how to configure a remote pod network and node address space. Install Tailscale on your hybrid nodes, set up a subnet router within your Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon VPC) , and update your AWS routes accordingly. This integration provides direct, encrypted connections that streamline the network architecture needed for EKS Hybrid Nodes. Although EKS Hybrid Nodes streamlines the Kubernetes management challenge, network connectivity between your on-premises infrastructure and AWS remains a critical requirement. Tailscale can help streamline this network connectivity between your EKS Hybrid Nodes data plane and Amazon EKS Kubernetes control plane. Unlike traditional VPNs, which tunnel all network traffic through a central gateway server, Tailscale creates a peer-to-peer mesh network (known as a tailnet ). It enables encrypted point-to-point connections using the open source WireGuard protocol, connecting devices and services across different networks with enhanced security features. However, you can still use Tailscale like a traditional VPN.</description></item><item><title>Kubernetes v1.34.0-rc.0</title><link>https://kubermates.org/releases/2025-08-06-kubernetes-v1-34-0-rc-0/</link><pubDate>Wed, 06 Aug 2025 20:20:08 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/releases/2025-08-06-kubernetes-v1-34-0-rc-0/</guid><description>See kubernetes-announce@.

With roughly 45 to 50 million users, network reliability is non-negotiable. Any downtime could affect millions. By 2022, the company had containerized 80% of its workloads on Kubernetes across three self-managed data centers. While the platform, backed by bare metal nodes and custom network layers, was highly scalable, network throughput bottlenecks began to emerge. Pods were limited to 2. 5 Gbps of bandwidth due to IP encapsulation overhead, despite 10 Gbps network interfaces. The team needed a solution that: 1&amp;amp;1 Mail &amp;amp; Media had adopted Calico back in 2017, largely for its unique Kubernetes NetworkPolicy standard support. As their Kubernetes platform evolved, with clusters scaling to 300 bare metal nodes, 16,000 pods, and over 4 million conntrack entries, the team turned to Calico’s eBPF data plane to unlock performance gains. Following successful initial trials of eBPF in development and integration environments, the team moved forward with production migrations in 2023. While early versions of Calico on older Linux kernel versions presented some limitations, these challenges were quickly addressed with proactive collaboration between the Calico maintainers and the team.</description></item><item><title>August 05, 2025</title><link>https://kubermates.org/releases/2025-08-05-august-05-2025/</link><pubDate>Tue, 05 Aug 2025 00:00:00 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/releases/2025-08-05-august-05-2025/</guid><description>This page includes release notes for all channels and releases.

As modern workloads become more distributed and ephemeral, traditional logging and metrics just can’t keep up with the complexity of cloud-native traffic flows. That’s where Calico Whisker comes in. Whisker is a lightweight Kubernetes-native observability tool created by Tigera. It offers deep insights into real-time traffic flow patterns, without requiring you to deploy heavyweight service meshes or packet sniffer. And here’s something you won’t get anywhere else: Whisker is data plane-agnostic. Whether you run Calico eBPF data plane, nftables, or iptables, you’ll get the same high-fidelity flow logs with consistent fields, format, and visibility. You don’t have to change your data plane, Whisker fits right in and shows you the truth, everywhere. Let’s walk through 5 network issues Whisker helps you catch early, before they turn into outages or security incidents. Traditional observability tools often show whether a packet was forwarded, accepted or dropped, but not why. They lack visibility into which Kubernetes network policy was responsible or if one was even applied. With Whisker, each network flow is paired with: This lets you immediately spot: This makes it easy to answer questions like: You get proactive visibility into gaps in enforcement long before someone accidentally exposes an internal app to the public internet.</description></item><item><title>v1.33.3+k3s1</title><link>https://kubermates.org/releases/2025-07-29-v1-33-3-k3s1/</link><pubDate>Tue, 29 Jul 2025 17:43:05 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/releases/2025-07-29-v1-33-3-k3s1/</guid><description>This release updates Kubernetes to v1. 33. 3, and fixes a number of issues.

It gives us the ability to spin up a virtual data center in minutes, scaling infrastructure with ease. But with great power comes great complexities, and in the case of Kubernetes, that complexity is security. By default, Kubernetes permits all traffic between workloads in a cluster. This “allow by default” stance is convenient during development, and testing but it’s dangerous in production. It’s up to DevOps, DevSecOps, and cloud platform teams to lock things down. To improve the security posture of a Kubernetes cluster, we can use microsegmentation , a practice that limits each workload’s network reach so it can only talk to the specific resources it needs. This is an essential security method in today’s cloud-native environments. We all understand that network policies can achieve microsegmentation; or in other words, it can divide our Kubernetes network model into isolated pieces. This is important since Kubernetes is usually used to provide multiple teams with their infrastructural needs or host multiple workloads for different tenants. With that, you would think network policies are first citizens of clusters. However, when we dig into implementing them, three operational challenges make most practitioners reluctant about implementing policies.</description></item><item><title>Pre-release v1.8.5-rc.3</title><link>https://kubermates.org/releases/2025-07-23-pre-release-v1-8-5-rc-3/</link><pubDate>Wed, 23 Jul 2025 06:31:09 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/releases/2025-07-23-pre-release-v1-8-5-rc-3/</guid><description>There was an error while loading.

In IPv6-enabled EKS clusters, each pod receives a unique IPv6 address from the Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon VPC) IPv6 range, with seamless compatibility facilitated by the Amazon EKS VPC Container Network Interface (CNI). This solution effectively addresses two major IPv4 limitations: the scarcity of private addresses and the security vulnerabilities created by overlapping IPv4 spaces that need Network Address Translation (NAT) at the node level. When transitioning to IPv6, you likely need to run both IPv4 and IPv6 EKS clusters simultaneously. This is particularly important for organizations using Istio Service Mesh with Amazon EKS, because IPv6 clusters must integrate with the existing Service Mesh and work smoothly alongside IPv4 clusters. To streamline this transition, you can configure your Istio Service Mesh to support both your current IPv4 EKS clusters and your new IPv6 EKS clusters. If Istio Service Mesh isn’t part of your infrastructure, then we suggest exploring Amazon VPC Lattice as an alternative solution to speed up your IPv6 implementation on AWS. This post provides a step-by-step guide for combining IPv6-enabled EKS clusters with your existing Istio Service Mesh and IPv4 workloads, enabling a graceful transition to IPv6 on AWS. This guide covers detailed instructions for enabling communication between IPv6 and IPv4 EKS clusters, along with recommended practices for implementing IPv6 across both single and multiple VPC configurations. The functionality of Amazon EKS IPv6 builds on the native dual-stack capabilities of VPC. When you enable IPv6 in your VPC, it receives both IPv4 prefixes and a /56 IPv6 prefix. This IPv6 prefix can come from three sources: Amazon’s Global Unicast Address (GUA) space, your own IPv6 range (BYOIPv6), or a Unique Local Address (ULA) space.</description></item><item><title>Four Powerful, New Features to Help You Build and Deploy More Efficient Apps On DigitalOcean Kubernetes</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-07-22-four-powerful-new-features-to-help-you-build-and-deploy-more-efficient-apps-on-d/</link><pubDate>Tue, 22 Jul 2025 16:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-07-22-four-powerful-new-features-to-help-you-build-and-deploy-more-efficient-apps-on-d/</guid><description>By Nicole Ghalwash Weâre adding to Marchâs updates with even more Managed Kubernetes features that will help you get even more utility out of the productâincluding newly supported Droplet types, the ability to automatically scale nodes to zero when youâre not using them, and more.

Explore the new features by logging into your DigitalOcean account. You can now deploy GPU-accelerated workloads on DigitalOcean Managed Kubernetes using our latest GPU Droplet types (both NVIDIA and AMD ). These new instance types are ideal for AI/ML training and inference, image and video processing, and other compute-intensive workloads. With native support for GPU nodes in your Kubernetes clusters, you get the flexibility of containers with the raw power of high-performance GPUs-fully integrated into the DOKS experience. Here are the new GPU Droplet types: This feature allows a node pool to automatically scale down to zero nodes when there are no active workloads that require those nodes. You can now enable the node pools within your Kubernetes environment to automatically scale down to zero when idle, stopping compute charges during those periods of inactivity. This feature is optimal for development or testing environments, applications with usage patterns tied to business hours that naturally yield idle periods, or workloads that use specialized node pools like GPU or CPU-Optimized for intermittent jobs. The main components of this feature include: 1.</description></item><item><title>Introducing ERNIE 4.5-21B-A3B-Base</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-07-22-introducing-ernie-4-5-21b-a3b-base/</link><pubDate>Tue, 22 Jul 2025 14:51:42 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-07-22-introducing-ernie-4-5-21b-a3b-base/</guid><description>By Waverly Swinton and Quinn Eckart TL;DR: Baidu recently released ERNIE 4. 5-21B-A3B-Base, a powerful open-source LLM You can launch ERNIE 4. 5-21B directly on DigitalOcean GPU Droplets with only 1-click - deploy in the cloud console We put ERNIE 4. 5-21B to the test for translation and it outperformed models like Qwen3 - check out our demo ERNIE (Enhanced Representation through kNowledge IntEgration) 4. 5-21B-A3B-Base represents a significant leap in large language model development.

EKS Hybrid Nodes provides you with the flexibility to run your containerized applications wherever needed, while maintaining standardized Kubernetes management practices and addressing latency, compliance, and data residency needs. EKS Hybrid Nodes accelerates infrastructure modernization by repurposing existing hardware investments. Organizations can harness the elastic scalability, high availability, and fully managed advantages of Amazon EKS, while making sure of operational consistency through unified workflows and toolsets across hybrid environments. One of the key aspects of the EKS Hybrid Nodes solution is the hybrid network architecture between the cloud-based Amazon EKS control plane and your on-premises nodes. This post dives deep into the cluster networking configurations, guiding you through the process of integrating an EKS cluster with hybrid nodes in your existing infrastructure. In this walkthrough, we set up different Container Network Interface (CNI) options and load balancing solutions on EKS Hybrid Nodes to meet your networking requirements. EKS Hybrid Nodes needs private network connectivity between the cloud-hosted Amazon EKS control plane and the hybrid nodes running in your on-premises environment. This connectivity can be established using either Amazon Web Services (AWS) Direct Connect or AWS Site-to-Site VPN , through an AWS Transit Gateway or the Virtual Private Gateway into your Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon VPC). For an optimal experience, AWS recommends reliable network connectivity with at least 100 Mbps bandwidth, and a maximum of 200ms round-trip latency, for hybrid nodes connecting to the AWS Region. This is general guidance rather than a strict requirement, and specific bandwidth and latency requirements may differ based on the quantity of hybrid nodes and your application’s unique characteristics. The node and pod Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR) blocks for your hybrid nodes and container workloads must be within the IPv4 RFC-1918 ranges.</description></item><item><title>v1.30.14-rc1+k3s2</title><link>https://kubermates.org/releases/2025-07-21-v1-30-14-rc1-k3s2/</link><pubDate>Mon, 21 Jul 2025 18:52:11 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/releases/2025-07-21-v1-30-14-rc1-k3s2/</guid><description>There was an error while loading.

Distributed training and LLMs fine-tuning, in particular, involves managing multiple nodes, GPUs, large datasets, and fault tolerance, which often requires deep Kubernetes knowledge. The Kubeflow Trainer v2 (KF Trainer) was created to hide this complexity, by abstracting Kubernetes from AI Practitioners and providing the easiest, most scalable way to run distributed PyTorch jobs. The main goals of Kubeflow Trainer v2 include: We’re deeply grateful to all contributors and community members who made the Trainer v2 possible with their hard work and valuable feedback. We’d like to give special recognition to andreyvelich , tenzen-y , electronic-waste , astefanutti , ironicbo , mahdikhashan , kramaranya , harshal292004 , akshaychitneni , chenyi015 and the rest of the contributors. We would also like to highlight ahg-g , kannon92 , and vsoch whose feedback was essential while we designed the Kubeflow Trainer architecture together with the Batch WG. See the full contributor list for everyone who helped make this release possible. Kubeflow Trainer v2 represents the next evolution of the Kubeflow Training Operator , building on over seven years of experience running ML workloads on Kubernetes. The journey began in 2017 when the Kubeflow project introduced TFJob to orchestrate TensorFlow training on Kubernetes. At that time, Kubernetes lacked many of the advanced batch processing features needed for distributed ML training, so the community had to implement these capabilities from scratch. Over the years, the project expanded to support multiple ML frameworks including PyTorch , MXNet , MPI , and XGBoost through various specialized operators. In 2021, these were consolidated into the unified Training Operator v1.</description></item><item><title>🧩 GitHub Actions Composite vs Reusable Workflows</title><link>https://kubermates.org/blog/github-actions-composite-vs-reusable-workflows-4bih/</link><pubDate>Fri, 18 Jul 2025 08:41:53 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/blog/github-actions-composite-vs-reusable-workflows-4bih/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="how-to-standardize-and-supercharge-your-cicd-pipelines-across-projects"&gt;How to standardize and supercharge your CI/CD pipelines across projects&lt;/h2&gt;

Today, Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (Amazon EKS) announced support for clusters with up to 100,000 nodes. With Amazon EC2’s new generation accelerated computing instance types, this translates to 1. 6 million AWS Trainium chips or 800,000 NVIDIA GPUs in a single Kubernetes cluster. This unlocks ultra scale artificial intelligence (AI) and machine leaning (ML) workloads such as state-of-the-art model training, fine-tuning and agentic inference. Besides customers directly consuming Amazon EKS today, these improvements also extend to other AI/ML services like Amazon SageMaker HyperPod with EKS that leverage EKS as their compute layer, advancing AWS’s overall ultra scale computing capabilities. Our customers have made it clear that containerization of training jobs and operators such as Kubeflow, the ability to streamline resource provisioning and lifecycle through projects like Karpenter, support for pluggable scheduling strategies, and access to a vast ecosystem of cloud-native tools is critical for their success in the AI/ML domain. Kubernetes has emerged as a key enabler here due to its powerful and extensible API model along with robust container orchestration capabilities, allowing accelerated workloads to scale quickly and run reliably. Through multiple technical innovations, architectural improvements and open-source collaboration, Amazon EKS has built the next generation of its cluster control plane and data plane for ultra scale, with full Kubernetes conformance. At AWS, we recommend customers running general-purpose applications with low coupling and horizontal scalability to follow a cell-based architecture as the strategy to sustain growth.</description></item><item><title>Amazon EKS enables ultra scale AI/ML workloads with support for 100K nodes per cluster</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-07-16-amazon-eks-enables-ultra-scale-ai-ml-workloads-with-support-for-100k-nodes-per-c/</link><pubDate>Wed, 16 Jul 2025 00:14:26 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-07-16-amazon-eks-enables-ultra-scale-ai-ml-workloads-with-support-for-100k-nodes-per-c/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Open the original post ↗ &lt;a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/containers/amazon-eks-enables-ultra-scale-ai-ml-workloads-with-support-for-100k-nodes-per-cluster/"&gt;https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/containers/amazon-eks-enables-ultra-scale-ai-ml-workloads-with-support-for-100k-nodes-per-cluster/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Kubernetes v1.33.3</title><link>https://kubermates.org/releases/2025-07-15-kubernetes-v1-33-3/</link><pubDate>Tue, 15 Jul 2025 22:19:31 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/releases/2025-07-15-kubernetes-v1-33-3/</guid><description>See kubernetes-announce@.

By default, the Amazon VPC CNI plugin assigns one IP address to each pod. This IP address is attached to an elastic network interface that handles all incoming and outgoing traffic for the pod. To increase the bandwidth and packet per second rate performance, you can use the Multi-NIC feature of the VPC CNI to configure a multi-homed pod. A multi-homed pod is a single Kubernetes pod that uses multiple network interfaces (and multiple IP addresses). By running a multi-homed pod, you can spread its application traffic across multiple network interfaces by using concurrent connections. This is especially useful for Artificial Intelligence (AI), Machine Learning (ML), and High Performance Computing (HPC) use cases. The following diagram shows a multi-homed pod running on a worker node with multiple network interface cards (NICs) in use. On Amazon EC2, an elastic network interface is a logical networking component in a VPC that represents a virtual network card. For many EC2 instance types, the network interfaces share a single network interface card (NIC) in hardware. This single NIC has a maximum bandwidth and packet per second rate. If the multi-NIC feature is enabled, the VPC CNI doesnât assign IP addresses in bulk, which it does by default.</description></item><item><title>Dry Run: Your Kubernetes network policies with Calico staged network policies</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-07-15-dry-run-your-kubernetes-network-policies-with-calico-staged-network-policies/</link><pubDate>Tue, 15 Jul 2025 14:01:01 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-07-15-dry-run-your-kubernetes-network-policies-with-calico-staged-network-policies/</guid><description>Kubernetes Network Policies (KNP) are powerful resources that help secure and isolate workloads in a cluster. By defining what traffic is allowed to and from specific pods, KNPs provide the foundation for zero-trust networking and least-privilege access in cloud-native environments. But there’s a problem: KNPs are risky, and applying them without a clear game plan can be potentially disruptive. Without deep insight into existing traffic flows, applying a restrictive policy can instantly break connectivity killing live workloads, user sessions, or critical app dependencies. An even scarier scenario is when we implement policies that we think cover everything and workloads actually work, but after a restart or scaling operation we hit new problems. Kubernetes, with all of its features, has no built-in “dry run” mode for policies, and no first-class observability to show what would be blocked or allowed which is the right decision since Kubernetes is an orchestrator not an implementer. This forces platform teams into a difficult choice, deploy permissive or no policies and weaken security, or Risk service disruption while debugging restrictive ones. As a result, many teams delay implementing network policies entirely only to regret it after a zero-day exploit like Log4Shell, XZ backdoor, or other vulnerabilities that can impact production. The fear of breaking something becomes the top reason why Kubernetes environments go unsegmented. You can’t enforce what you can’t test safely. For instance, let’s say you want to secure a workload deployed by another team. You don’t control how it was configured.</description></item><item><title>Nirmata Teams Dashboard Gets a Makeover: A Cleaner, Smarter Experience for Managing Kubernetes and Cloud Environments</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-07-15-nirmata-teams-dashboard-gets-a-makeover-a-cleaner-smarter-experience-for-managin/</link><pubDate>Tue, 15 Jul 2025 08:00:09 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-07-15-nirmata-teams-dashboard-gets-a-makeover-a-cleaner-smarter-experience-for-managin/</guid><description>We’re excited to announce a refreshed Teams Dashboard in Nirmata Control Hub. This redesign delivers a cleaner, more intuitive interface that not only looks better, it works better too. Whether you’re managing a few teams or dozens, the new dashboard streamlines how you view and interact with team-related data across your Kubernetes and cloud environments. To improve visibility and team-level accountability, the dashboard now shows how infrastructure resources are allocated across teams. You can easily see which Kubernetes clusters, namespaces, and repositories belong to each team – such as Security, Platform, or Development – and who the team members are. This makes it simpler to understand team footprints, manage access, and align infrastructure usage with organizational structure. Team cards have been completely redesigned with a cleaner layout that makes key information immediately visible. Each card now includes: This update gives you a high-level snapshot of your teams’ footprint across your infrastructure , helping you stay informed at a glance. We’ve improved how policy report assignments are surfaced on each team card, offering better visibility and preparing the groundwork for even more powerful insights and statistics in future releases. Instead of listing all teams on one long scroll, we now paginate the dashboard. You’ll see 12 teams at a time, making navigation faster and more manageable, especially for larger organizations. We’ve also made significant improvements to the Team Details page, focusing on clarity and ease of use.</description></item><item><title>What Is Kubernetes?

Finally, a blog that will explain &amp;ldquo;What is Kubernetes?&amp;rdquo; in very simple words ; an explanation for normal human beings. But Kubernetes is a solution to a problem. And to understand the solution, you first have to look at the problem it solves. Containers, containers, containers… in the voice of Steve Ballmer. You probably heard about Docker. But even if you didn&amp;rsquo;t, it&amp;rsquo;s no big deal to understand it. Docker is a set of tools that allow you to create, edit, and run containers. And a container is just an application in a small little box. What&amp;rsquo;s so cool about containers? Well, one thing is that the application has all that it needs (the so-called dependencies ) inside that little box. So you can take that container, run it on Windows, MacOS, Linux, whatever. It won&amp;rsquo;t complain that stuff is missing.</description></item><item><title>From Raw Data to Model Serving: A Blueprint for the AI/ML Lifecycle with Kubeflow</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-07-15-from-raw-data-to-model-serving-a-blueprint-for-the-ai-ml-lifecycle-with-kubeflow/</link><pubDate>Tue, 15 Jul 2025 00:00:00 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-07-15-from-raw-data-to-model-serving-a-blueprint-for-the-ai-ml-lifecycle-with-kubeflow/</guid><description>Jul 15, 2025 • Helber Belmiro • 22 min read mlops pipelines spark feast model-registry kserve Are you looking for a practical, reproducible way to take a machine learning project from raw data all the way to a deployed, production-ready model? This post is your blueprint for the AI/ML lifecycle: you’ll learn how to use Kubeflow and open source tools such as Feast to build a workflow you can run on your laptop and adapt to your own projects. We’ll walk through the entire ML lifecycle—from data preparation to live inference—leveraging the Kubeflow platform to create a cohesive, production-grade MLOps workflow. The project implements a complete MLOps workflow for a fraud detection use case. Fraud detection is a critical application in financial services, where organizations need to identify potentially fraudulent transactions in real-time while minimizing false positives that could disrupt legitimate customer activity. Our fraud detection system leverages machine learning to analyze large volumes of transaction data, learn patterns from historical behavior, and flag suspicious transactions that deviate from normal patterns. The model considers various features such as transaction amounts, location data, merchant information, and user behavior patterns to make predictions. This makes fraud detection an ideal use case for demonstrating MLOps concepts because it requires: The workflow ingests raw transaction data, proceeds through data preparation and feature engineering, then model training and registration, and finally deploys the model as a production-ready inference service that can evaluate transactions in real-time. The entire workflow is orchestrated as a Kubeflow Pipeline, which provides a powerful framework for defining, deploying, and managing complex machine learning pipelines on Kubernetes. Here is a high-level overview of the pipeline: The pipeline assumes that the initial datasets ( train. csv , test. csv , etc. ) are already available.</description></item><item><title>Kubernetes Monitoring backend 2.2: better cluster observability through new alert and recording rules</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-07-15-kubernetes-monitoring-backend-2-2-better-cluster-observability-through-new-alert/</link><pubDate>Tue, 15 Jul 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-07-15-kubernetes-monitoring-backend-2-2-better-cluster-observability-through-new-alert/</guid><description>Pete Wall Â· 17 Jun 2025 Â· 5 min read Our latest Kubernetes Monitoring Helm chart offers easier, dynamic configuration with Alloy Operator.

By keeping infrastructure and cost management simple, the Hatch program enables startups to build tech solutions that make an impact. For Georgi Petrov and Mihail Stoychev, the co-founders and serial entrepreneurs behind Uxify , choosing DigitalOcean to host their startupâs infrastructure was a no-brainer. They built their previous ventures NitroPack, SMSBump, and iSenseLabs on DigitalOcean and could trust the platformâs simplicity, reliability, and user experience. When it came time to power Uxifyâs AI-enabled website performance solution and AI agent Uxi, they opted for DigitalOcean again With Hatch program benefits like cloud credits and GPU Droplet discounts, Uxify could focus on building and scaling their underlying AI infrastructure. Uxifyâs story begins over a decade ago with iSenseLabs, an agency that provided services but also built and sold its own products. One of those products was NitroPack, a performance optimization tool designed to help websites load faster. As NitroPack gained traction, the team began seeing possibilities beyond their current solution. Fast forward to 2024, the team behind NitroPack reached a pivotal moment. They began rethinking web performance and userâs perception of site responsivenessâ¦ This new philosophy led them to develop Navigation AI, a performance solution focused on user experience rather than purely technical metrics. Around the same time, NitroPack was acquired by WP Engine. As part of that acquisition, the emerging Navigation AI project was spun out into a new company: Uxify.</description></item><item><title>Sharks of DigitalOcean: Laura Schaffer, VP, Growth</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-07-10-sharks-of-digitalocean-laura-schaffer-vp-growth/</link><pubDate>Thu, 10 Jul 2025 15:25:33 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-07-10-sharks-of-digitalocean-laura-schaffer-vp-growth/</guid><description>By Sujatha R Technical Writer Laura Schaffer, Vice President of Growth at DigitalOcean, leads the team responsible for helping customers onboard and grow with DigitalOcean.

This blog post dives into the challenges of managing failure modes when operating pods with devices in Kubernetes, based on insights from Sergey Kanzhelev and Mrunal Patel&amp;rsquo;s talk at KubeCon NA 2024. You can follow the links to slides and recording. The rise of AI/ML workloads has brought new challenges to Kubernetes. These workloads often rely heavily on specialized hardware, and any device failure can significantly impact performance and lead to frustrating interruptions. As highlighted in the 2024 Llama paper , hardware issues, particularly GPU failures, are a major cause of disruption in AI/ML training. You can also learn how much effort NVIDIA spends on handling devices failures and maintenance in the KubeCon talk by Ryan Hallisey and Piotr Prokop All-Your-GPUs-Are-Belong-to-Us: An Inside Look at NVIDIA&amp;rsquo;s Self-Healing GeForce NOW Infrastructure ( recording ) as they see 19 remediation requests per 1000 nodes a day! We also see data centers offering spot consumption models and overcommit on power, making device failures commonplace and a part of the business model. However, Kubernetes’s view on resources is still very static. The resource is either there or not. And if it is there, the assumption is that it will stay there fully functional - Kubernetes lacks good support for handling full or partial hardware failures. These long-existing assumptions combined with the overall complexity of a setup lead to a variety of failure modes, which we discuss here. Generally, all AI/ML workloads require specialized hardware, have challenging scheduling requirements, and are expensive when idle.</description></item><item><title>A Detailed Look at Calico Cloud Free Tier</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-07-02-a-detailed-look-at-calico-cloud-free-tier/</link><pubDate>Wed, 02 Jul 2025 20:23:35 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-07-02-a-detailed-look-at-calico-cloud-free-tier/</guid><description>As Kubernetes environments grow in scale and complexity, platform teams face increasing pressure to secure workloads without slowing down application delivery. But managing and enforcing network policies in Kubernetes is notoriously difficult—especially when visibility into pod-to-pod communication is limited or nonexistent. Teams are often forced to rely on manual traffic inspection, standalone logs, or trial-and-error policy changes, increasing the risk of misconfiguration and service disruption. Safe policy management and microsegmentation becomes a daunting task without clear knowledge or insight into which services should communicate with each other. In this detailed look, we’ll explore how Calico Cloud Free Tier builds upon Calico Open Source , and helps platform teams visualize traffic with a dynamic service graph, simplifies policy management, and even analyzes actual traffic to recommend policies. Calico Cloud Free Tier is a managed SaaS, no-cost offering that extends the capabilities of Calico Open Source 3. 30 and higher to help Kubernetes teams improve network visibility, simplify policy management, and improve security by simplifying microsegmentation. Designed for single-cluster environments, it provides platform engineers and operators with powerful observability and policy management tools. With a seamless onboarding experience for users already running Calico Open Source 3. 30 or higher, Calico Cloud Free Tier empowers teams to take control of their Kubernetes traffic—without additional cost or vendor lock-in. Let’s take a closer look at the key features that make Calico Cloud Free Tier a powerful solution for Kubernetes network security and observability: Calico’s primary observability solution is Dynamic Service Graph , a powerful visualization tool that maps real-time pod-to-pod communication across your cluster. This Service Graph, which is available in Calico Cloud Free Tier, gives you an immediate understanding of how workloads interact, making it far easier to identify unexpected traffic patterns or missing connections.</description></item><item><title>July 02, 2025</title><link>https://kubermates.org/releases/2025-07-02-july-02-2025/</link><pubDate>Wed, 02 Jul 2025 00:00:00 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/releases/2025-07-02-july-02-2025/</guid><description>This page includes release notes for all channels and releases.

With custom roles, teams can now assign permissions to individuals that are precisely aligned with their operational and security requirements, reinforcing the principle of least privilege. This allows for more precise permission management, which helps to enhance overall infrastructure security by reducing the risk of over-privileged accounts. Custom roles give you full control over who can do what on your projects, improving the overall security of your cloud resources. In this blog post, we will walk through what custom roles are, how they work, key features, when to use them, and how they can help your team. Custom roles are user-defined sets of permissions that allow organizations to tailor access control to their specific needs, beyond whatâs available in predefined roles. In other words, custom roles let you create your own set of permissions instead of relying only on default, predefined roles (like Viewer, Billing Viewer, etc. ) that may not work for you. Now, users can define more detailed custom permissions that target specific resources and needs. For example, a user may only need read access to Droplets, but write access to Kubernetes. Hear what a DigitalOcean customer had to say about using custom roles. This customer is a Co-founder of a revenue management company: âCustom roles helped me bring my team onto the platform without granting blanket access.</description></item><item><title>Is Your Kyverno Healthy?

But is your Kyverno setup secure, scalable, and resilient? With the latest enhancement in Nirmata Control Hub , you no longer have to guess. We’re excited to introduce the Kyverno Health Check – a new capability that provides a clear, actionable view of Kyverno’s configuration in your clusters. Whether you’re a platform engineer managing dozens of clusters or a security lead enforcing policy compliance, this feature helps to ensure that Kyverno is running optimally at all times. Kyverno by Nirmata enforces critical security, compliance, and operational policies in Kubernetes. But like any controller, its effectiveness depends on its own configuration and health. A misconfigured or unhealthy Kyverno deployment can : Kyverno Health Check ensures none of this happens by continuously and vigilantly evaluating your deployments for best practices and known risks. The new Kyverno Health Check feature in Nirmata Control Hub evaluates Kyverno deployments based on four critical categories: Each category is scored and flagged as: These results are aggregated into a Kyverno Health Grade (A to F), allowing you to view the overall state of Kyverno at a glance and drill down to address the areas that matter most. In many clusters, Kyverno components may restart frequently or be terminated due to out-of-memory (OOM) conditions. These issues often go unnoticed until policy failures occur. That’s a risk. Nirmata Control Hub detects this and gives you: You or your team can apply the fix, rescan the cluster, and watch your health grade improve.</description></item><item><title>Cut Through the DevSecOps Noise: Smart Violation Prioritization in Nirmata Control Hub</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-06-27-cut-through-the-devsecops-noise-smart-violation-prioritization-in-nirmata-contro/</link><pubDate>Fri, 27 Jun 2025 14:54:55 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-06-27-cut-through-the-devsecops-noise-smart-violation-prioritization-in-nirmata-contro/</guid><description>When managing security and compliance in Kubernetes, it’s easy to get overwhelmed. As a platform engineer or administrator, you might look at your cluster or namespace and find hundreds or even thousands of violations. But not all violations are created equal. Some are critical security risks that demand immediate attention, while others are best practices that can be addressed later. The problem? Without clear guidance, most teams end up doing nothing. Not because they don’t care – but because they don’t know where to start. That’s exactly the problem we solve with Violation Summarization and Prioritization in Nirmata Control Hub. With Nirmata Control Hub, you don’t have to dig through pages of findings and all the time spent therein. With a timely glance, you get a summary report for your entire cluster or specific namespaces, showing: Nirmata Control Hub won’t just tell you what’s wrong. We prioritize violations into clear buckets: This intelligent triage lets your team focus on what matters most – without getting distracted by noise.

An AWS managed policy is a standalone policy that is created and administered by AWS. AWS managed policies are designed to provide permissions for many common use cases so that you can start assigning permissions to users, groups, and roles. Keep in mind that AWS managed policies might not grant least-privilege permissions for your specific use cases because theyâre available for all AWS customers to use. We recommend that you reduce permissions further by defining customer managed policies that are specific to your use cases. You cannot change the permissions defined in AWS managed policies. If AWS updates the permissions defined in an AWS managed policy, the update affects all principal identities (users, groups, and roles) that the policy is attached to. AWS is most likely to update an AWS managed policy when a new AWS service is launched or new API operations become available for existing services. For more information, see AWS managed policies in the IAM User Guide. You can attach the AmazonEKS_CNI_Policy to your IAM entities. Before you create an Amazon EC2 node group, this policy must be attached to either the node IAM role , or to an IAM role thatâs used specifically by the Amazon VPC CNI plugin for Kubernetes. This is so that it can perform actions on your behalf.</description></item><item><title>More resilient, flexible networking for the cloud workloads that matter</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-06-26-more-resilient-flexible-networking-for-the-cloud-workloads-that-matter/</link><pubDate>Thu, 26 Jun 2025 16:50:42 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-06-26-more-resilient-flexible-networking-for-the-cloud-workloads-that-matter/</guid><description>By Anantha Ramachandran and Udhay Ravindran Building and scaling cloud infrastructure often means navigating fragile network configurations, unpredictable IP behavior, and rigid networking provider limitations. Whether itâs dealing with flaky multi-cloud connections, scrambling to update IP allow-lists after a restart, or hesitating to migrate workloads due to reputation-bound IPs, these challenges add unnecessary risk and complexity to modern deployments. Weâre excited to announce three new updates designed to simplify cloud networking and enhance deployment flexibility: Partner Network Connect supports high availability and DOKS, general availability of Reserved IPv6 on Droplets, and public preview of Bring Your Own IP (BYOIP). These improvements address real-world infrastructure challenges and are built with simplicity, scalability, and reliability in mind. Multi-cloud architectures are great, until the private links between them become a single point of failure. For teams routing traffic between multiple cloud providers like DigitalOcean, AWS, Microsoft Azure, or Google Cloud Platform, even brief disruptions can stall ML pipelines, gaming platforms, or analytics services. Traditional setups offer limited redundancy, and recovering from outages usually involves manual intervention or rerouting traffic over public networks. High Availability for Partner Network Connect helps solve this by letting you provision redundant links across two separate DigitalOcean gateway routers. Traffic automatically fails over if one link goes down, with no manual steps required and no impact to your customers. With fully managed failover, this update removes operational overhead while helping meet the needs of latency-sensitive or distributed systems. Key benefits include: Automatic failover: Eliminate downtime from single link failures. Reliable for demanding workloads: Especially useful for platforms in streaming, AI, or multiplayer applications.</description></item><item><title>Switching to eBPF One Step at a Time with Calico DNS Inline Policy</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-06-25-switching-to-ebpf-one-step-at-a-time-with-calico-dns-inline-policy/</link><pubDate>Wed, 25 Jun 2025 16:05:49 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-06-25-switching-to-ebpf-one-step-at-a-time-with-calico-dns-inline-policy/</guid><description>Calico Enterprise lets users write network policies using domain names instead of IP addresses. This is done by dynamically mapping domain names to IP addresses and matching the egress traffic against these IPs. We have discussed this feature in detail when we introduced the Inline mode for the eBPF data plane in Calico Enterprise 3. 20 release! It addresses the latency and performance issues of the various modes used by Calico in iptables/nftables data planes. It is a shame that Calico users who are not yet ready to switch completely to eBPF would miss out on this big DNS policy improvement. Don’t worry! We found a way to port it to iptables to enhance our users’ experience without forcing users to make a huge leap. In Calico Enterprise v3. 21, we have extended the Inline DNS policy mode to iptables. In this mode, DNS policies are updated in real time as DNS responses are parsed by eBPF within the data plane, thus improving the performance. In all the existing modes in the iptables data plane, the DNS response packets are sent to Felix – Calico’s userspace agent. It parses the packets and updates the data plane since advanced packet parsing is not feasible with standard iptables rules. However, iptables has an xt_bpf extension which lets us process and match the packets by an eBPF program the same way we do that in the eBPF data plane! An iptables rule that allows it may look something like this: The iptables rule calls the eBPF DNS parser program on the response packet and updates the data plane inline.</description></item><item><title>June 25, 2025</title><link>https://kubermates.org/releases/2025-06-25-june-25-2025/</link><pubDate>Wed, 25 Jun 2025 00:00:00 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/releases/2025-06-25-june-25-2025/</guid><description>This page includes release notes for all channels and releases.

It is common practice to require the use of specific versions of the kernel, its configuration, device drivers, or system components. Despite the existence of the Open Container Initiative (OCI) , a governing community to define standards and specifications for container images, there has been a gap in expression of such compatibility requirements. The need to address this issue has led to different proposals and, ultimately, an implementation in Kubernetes&amp;rsquo; Node Feature Discovery (NFD). NFD is an open source Kubernetes project that automatically detects and reports hardware and system features of cluster nodes. This information helps users to schedule workloads on nodes that meet specific system requirements, which is especially useful for applications with strict hardware or operating system dependencies. A container image is built on a base image, which provides a minimal runtime environment, often a stripped-down Linux userland, completely empty or distroless. When an application requires certain features from the host OS, compatibility issues arise. These dependencies can manifest in several ways: While containers in Kubernetes are the most likely unit of abstraction for these needs, the definition of compatibility can extend further to include other container technologies such as Singularity and other OCI artifacts such as binaries from a spack binary cache. Containerized applications are deployed across various Kubernetes distributions and cloud providers, where different host operating systems introduce compatibility challenges. Often those have to be pre-configured before workload deployment or are immutable. For instance, different cloud providers will include different operating systems like: Each OS comes with unique kernel versions, configurations, and drivers, making compatibility a non-trivial issue for applications requiring specific features.</description></item><item><title>4.20.0-okd-scos.ec.5</title><link>https://kubermates.org/releases/2025-06-24-4-20-0-okd-scos-ec-5/</link><pubDate>Tue, 24 Jun 2025 21:02:12 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/releases/2025-06-24-4-20-0-okd-scos-ec-5/</guid><description>These archives contain the client tooling for OKD on CentOS Stream CoreOS.

Thatâs why weâre pleased to announce that we have made several new observability, monitoring, and hardening advancements to DigitalOcean Managed Databasesâto give you better visibility, understanding, and peace of mind. To be exact, we have made three advancements that will improve your Managed Database observability experience here at DigitalOcean. Letâs walk through all three of them. DigitalOcean Managed Databases now supports log forwarding to Datadog , enabling seamless integration to your existing Datadog observability dashboard. You can now send, view, and analyze your Managed Database logs directly within Datadog. This feature will enhance your overall observability and monitoring. Key features of this integration include: Direct log forwarding: This feature automatically pushes your database service logs to Datadogâs log intake endpoints, eliminating the need to manage a separate log collection agent. By automating log forwarding, you no longer have to worry about deploying, managing, or scaling additional logging agents, which helps to reduce operational complexity. UI-based configuration: The integration is fully configurable through the management console, allowing you to set it up for most database types directly within the log forwarding section. UI-based configuration simplifies the setup process and consolidates your database logs with application and infrastructure telemetry, improving visibility and monitoringâall without the need for managing separate agents. Customizable log templates: The Datadog log template can be customized per database, enabling specific log details or filtering to suit your needs.</description></item><item><title>June 24, 2025</title><link>https://kubermates.org/releases/2025-06-24-june-24-2025/</link><pubDate>Tue, 24 Jun 2025 00:00:00 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/releases/2025-06-24-june-24-2025/</guid><description>This page includes release notes for all channels and releases.

Weâve seen common pain points emerge, like struggling to track who accessed files through CDN endpoints, or wrestling with tricky configurations when using third-party tools like the AWS CLI or s3cmd, plus missed audit trails, prolonged troubleshooting, or accidental misconfigurations that can lead to data loss. Thatâs why weâve made two important updates to help simplify and strengthen the way you manage object storage with DigitalOcean Spaces , our S3-compatible object storage solution, built for simplicity, scalability, and affordability. Whether youâre serving up images on a website, storing large media files, managing data backups, or powering developer workflows, Spaces helps you move fast without managing infrastructure. These new featuresâthe general availability of Spaces access logs and the introduction of the connection wizardâare designed to enhance your visibility, minimize risk, and empower you to work with greater confidence. With access logs, you can get detailed, time-stamped records of all file read and write requests, including traffic that flows through both Spaces origin and CDN endpoints. Previously, there was no easy way to monitor who was accessing your files over the CDN. That made it difficult to troubleshoot, detect suspicious behavior, or meet compliance and audit requirements. Whatâs new Logs now capture both direct and CDN traffic, so you have a complete view of object activity. Spaces Origin access logs are compatible with Amazon S3 Server Access Logs format, while Spaces CDN access logs are compatible with Amazon CloudFront log formats, making it easy to integrate with tools you already use. Logs are stored in your existing Spaces buckets, so they fit directly within your existing services and workflows. Benefits of using Spaces access logs If you serve public files such as images, videos, downloadable content especially at scale or over a CDN, Access Logs can help you: Monitor object storage usage trends Detect unusual patterns or spikes Audit access to meet compliance needs Real-world use cases include AdTech and media platforms with high public traffic that need to track downloads and API activity across their CDN endpoints for better performance insights and usage monitoring.</description></item><item><title>June 18, 2025</title><link>https://kubermates.org/releases/2025-06-18-june-18-2025/</link><pubDate>Wed, 18 Jun 2025 00:00:00 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/releases/2025-06-18-june-18-2025/</guid><description>This page includes release notes for all channels and releases.

For years, Ingress has been the standard way of getting our HTTP/S services exposed. But let’s be honest, it often felt like a compromise. We wrestled with controller-specific annotations to unlock critical features, blurred the lines between infrastructure and application concerns, and sometimes wished for richer protocol support or a more standardized approach. This “pile of vendor annotations,” while functional, highlighted the limitations of a standard that struggled to keep pace with the complex demands of modern, multi-team environments and even led to security vulnerabilities. Yes, and it’s a crucial one. The Kubernetes Gateway API isn’t just an Ingress v2; it’s a fundamental redesign, the “future” of Kubernetes ingress, built by the community to address these very challenges head-on. There are three main points that I came across while evaluating GatewayAPI and Ingress controllers: The Ingress controller landscape is a mishmash of vendors with cool ideas. While they all can route HTTP/S traffic into your cluster, expanding your services to include other protocols puts you at the mercy of that vendor and the capabilities that they implement. On top of that, if you try to migrate from your old Ingress Controller to a new one at some point, there is that sweet conversation of vendor lock-in which ties your hands. If you are wondering how vendor lock-in plays a role here, then take a closer look at your Ingress resources, don’t they all share some sort of annotation? That “pile of vendor annotations,” while functional, is specific to that one great solution you are currently using, highlighting the limitations of a standard that struggled to keep pace and even led to security vulnerabilities. While Ingress isn’t disappearing tomorrow, the direction is clear.</description></item><item><title>June 16, 2025</title><link>https://kubermates.org/releases/2025-06-16-june-16-2025/</link><pubDate>Mon, 16 Jun 2025 00:00:00 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/releases/2025-06-16-june-16-2025/</guid><description>This page includes release notes for all channels and releases.

They ensure scalability, flexibility, and ease of maintenance by allowing individual services to operate and be updated autonomously. In this guide, we will break down what microservices are, how they operate, their advantages, key components, and best practices, offering a comprehensive overview for anyone looking to understand this modern architectural approach. Microservices are an architectural style that organizes an application as a collection of small, independently deployable services. Unlike traditional monolithic architectures, where a single service encapsulates all functionalities, microservices based applications break down applications into individual services, each focusing on a specific business capability. This modularity allows for independent deployment and scaling, making microservice architecture a popular choice for modern applications, particularly when considering internal microservices. One of the key characteristics of microservices is their cloud-native approach. Each service operates independently but is part of a larger application framework, often utilizing cloud resources to ensure scalability and fault tolerance. This approach not only enhances the flexibility of the system but also promotes the use of a diverse technology stack for different services, allowing teams to choose the best tools for each specific function, including individual microservices. Microservices are designed around bounded contexts, where a consistent domain model applies to a specific area of the application. This ensures that responsibilities are well defined, and each service can focus on a single function within the application. Small, cross-functional teams can manage and develop these services independently, fostering agility and rapid development cycles in a microservices architecture.</description></item><item><title>Blog: Changes to Kubernetes Slack</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-06-16-blog-changes-to-kubernetes-slack/</link><pubDate>Mon, 16 Jun 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-06-16-blog-changes-to-kubernetes-slack/</guid><description>UPDATE : We’ve received notice from Salesforce that our Slack workspace WILL NOT BE DOWNGRADED on June 20th.

This capability ensures your application remains responsive and performs well under varying traffic loads. In this article, we will cover the basics of Kubernetes HPA, how it works, best practices, and a hands-on example to help you master this critical Kubernetes feature. At its core, the Kubernetes Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA) is a Kubernetes resource that automatically adjusts the number of pod replicas based on observed CPU and memory usage metrics. This dynamic adjustment ensures your application maintains stable performance even as traffic fluctuates, making it a critical component for production workloads. Horizontal pod autoscaling HPA operates by continuously monitoring specified metrics and making scaling decisions to match the demand. The HPA utilizes resource metrics like CPU and memory, as well as custom metrics and cpu metrics, to determine the appropriate number of replicas needed. For example, if the average CPU utilization exceeds a predefined threshold, HPA will increase the number of replicas to distribute the load. Conversely, when the demand decreases, HPA reduces the number of replicas, optimizing resource usage and reducing costs. Additionally, the custom metrics api can be leveraged to enhance monitoring capabilities. This automatic scaling mechanism helps maintain application performance and reliability without manual intervention and automatically scales.

One key aspect of troubleshooting involves analyzing the application logs, which can provide valuable information about the root cause of the problem. Logs are essentially records of events happening within your application. By examining these logs, we can often gain insights into what went wrong. In this blog post, we’ll learn how to access Pod logs in Kubernetes using the kubectl logs command. Note that when we say Pod logs, we’re generally referring to the logs of the applications running in containers inside the Pod. To easily follow along with the examples in this post, we recommend using KodeKloud’s Kubernetes playground. This playground will provide you instant access to a running Kubernetes cluster with kubectl already installed. No need for you to install any software. With just one click, you&amp;rsquo;ll be ready to run the example code snippets and start experimenting right away.</description></item><item><title>Amazon EKS Auto Mode update to NodeClass</title><link>https://kubermates.org/releases/2025-06-13-amazon-eks-auto-mode-update-to-nodeclass/</link><pubDate>Fri, 13 Jun 2025 19:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/releases/2025-06-13-amazon-eks-auto-mode-update-to-nodeclass/</guid><description>Help improve this page To contribute to this user guide, choose the Edit this page on GitHub link that is located in the right pane of every page. Amazon EKS Node Classes are templates that offer granular control over the configuration of your EKS Auto Mode managed nodes. A Node Class defines infrastructure-level settings that apply to groups of nodes in your EKS cluster, including network configuration, storage settings, and resource tagging. This topic explains how to create and configure a Node Class to meet your specific operational requirements. When you need to customize how EKS Auto Mode provisions and configures EC2 instances beyond the default settings, creating a Node Class gives you precise control over critical infrastructure parameters. For example, you can specify private subnet placement for enhanced security, configure instance ephemeral storage for performance-sensitive workloads, or apply custom tagging for cost allocation. To create a NodeClass , follow these steps: Create a YAML file (for example, nodeclass. yaml ) with your Node Class configuration Apply the configuration to your cluster using kubectl Reference the Node Class in your Node Pool configuration. For more information, see Create a Node Pool for EKS Auto Mode. You need kubectl installed and configured. For more information, see Set up to use Amazon EKS. Hereâs an example Node Class: This NodeClass increases the amount of ephemeral storage on the node.</description></item><item><title>Introducing AMD Instinct™ MI300X GPU Droplets</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-06-12-introducing-amd-instinct-mi300x-gpu-droplets/</link><pubDate>Thu, 12 Jun 2025 13:30:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-06-12-introducing-amd-instinct-mi300x-gpu-droplets/</guid><description>By Waverly Swinton GPU Droplets are now DigitalOcean GradientAI GPU Droplets.

When running applications on Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (Amazon EKS), you might need to access AWS resources that exist in different AWS accounts. This guide shows you how to set up cross account access using EKS Pod Identity, which enables your Kubernetes pods to access other AWS resources using target roles. Before you begin, ensure you have completed the following steps: Set up the Amazon EKS Pod Identity Agent Create an EKS Pod Identity role Pod Identity enables applications in your EKS cluster to access AWS resources across accounts through a process called role chaining. When creating a Pod Identity association, you can provide two IAM roles: an EKS Pod Identity role in the same account as your EKS cluster and a Target IAM Role from the account containing your AWS resources you wish to access, (like S3 buckets or RDS Databases). The EKS Pod Identity role must be in your EKS clusterâs account due to IAM PassRole requirements, while the Target IAM Role can be in any AWS account. PassRole enables an AWS entity to delegate role assumption to another service. EKS Pod Identity uses PassRole to connect a role to a Kubernetes service account, requiring both the role and the identity passing it to be in the same AWS account as the EKS cluster. When your application pod needs to access AWS resources, it requests credentials from Pod Identity. Pod Identity then automatically performs two role assumptions in sequence: first assuming the EKS Pod Identity role , then using those credentials to assume the Target IAM Role. This process provides your pod with temporary credentials that have the permissions defined in the target role, allowing secure access to resources in other AWS accounts. Due to caching mechanisms, updates to an IAM role in an existing Pod Identity association may not take effect immediately in the pods running on your EKS cluster.</description></item><item><title>Secure and Scalable Kubernetes for Multi-Cluster Management</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-06-10-secure-and-scalable-kubernetes-for-multi-cluster-management/</link><pubDate>Tue, 10 Jun 2025 20:03:12 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-06-10-secure-and-scalable-kubernetes-for-multi-cluster-management/</guid><description>This story is becoming more and more common in the Kubernetes world. What starts as a manageable cluster or two can quickly balloon into a sprawling, multi-cluster architecture spanning public clouds, private data centers, or a bit of both. And with that growth comes a whole new set of headaches. How do you keep tabs on compliance across wildly different configurations? When a service goes down across multiple clusters, how do you pinpoint the cause amidst the chaos? And what about those hard-to-diagnose latency issues that seem to crop up between regions? The truth is, achieving secure and scalable multi-cluster Kubernetes isn’t about throwing more tools at the problem. It’s about having the right tools and adopting the right best practices. This is where a solution like Calico Cluster Mesh shines, offering those essential capabilities for a seamless multi-cluster experience without the complexity or overhead that you expect with traditional service meshes. So, why are so many organizations finding themselves in this multi-cluster maze? Often, it’s driven by solid business reasons: While these motivations are sound, the challenges that emerge in these multi-cloud environments are remarkably consistent: This is where Calico Cluster Mesh comes into play. It provides seamless connectivity between clusters deployed across different regions, VPCs, or VNETs, allowing you to interact with services as if they were local. Calico handles the networking with a VXLAN overlay, which means less reliance on cloud vendor-specific networking and fewer unnecessary network hops. Securing Kubernetes isn’t just about drawing lines around your network. It’s about truly understanding how your workloads interact and then enforcing granular policies, even across distributed clusters. A consistent and scalable policy model is absolutely vital in multi-cluster deployments.</description></item><item><title>K3s vs K8s: What are the Differences &amp; Use Cases</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-06-10-k3s-vs-k8s-what-are-the-differences-use-cases/</link><pubDate>Tue, 10 Jun 2025 07:48:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-06-10-k3s-vs-k8s-what-are-the-differences-use-cases/</guid><description>When it comes to container orchestration, K8s (Kubernetes) has become a de facto standard for managing applications and infrastructure at scale across on-premise data centres and public clouds. But as organizations look to deploy containerized workloads to devices at the edge of their network or for Internet of Things (IoT) applications, the full Kubernetes distribution can be overkill. This is where K3s comes in. Developed by Rancher Labs, K3s is a lightweight Kubernetes distribution designed specifically for resource-constrained edge and IoT environments. In this article, we&amp;rsquo;ll explain the key differences between K3s and the upstream Kubernetes project to help you understand when each makes the most sense for your application architecture and deployment needs. Try the Kubernetes Deployments Lab for free. Kubernetes is an open-source container orchestration platform that automates the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications. It allows you to define your application&amp;rsquo;s desired state and ensures that it runs consistently in a cluster of machines. Kubernetes automates tasks such as load balancing, self-healing, and scaling, making it easier to manage and maintain container-based applications. It has become the industry standard for container orchestration, simplifying the management of complex, distributed applications.

This blog post explores how to build custom event aggregation systems that help engineering teams better understand cluster behavior and troubleshoot issues more effectively. In a Kubernetes cluster, events are generated for various operations - from pod scheduling and container starts to volume mounts and network configurations. While these events are invaluable for debugging and monitoring, several challenges emerge in production environments: To learn more about Events in Kubernetes, read the Event API reference. Consider a production environment with tens of microservices where the users report intermittent transaction failures: Traditional event aggregation process: Engineers are wasting hours sifting through thousands of standalone events spread across namespaces. By the time they look into it, the older events have long since purged, and correlating pod restarts to node-level issues is practically impossible. With its event aggregation in its custom events: The system groups events across resources, instantly surfacing correlation patterns such as volume mount timeouts before pod restarts. History indicates it occurred during past record traffic spikes, highlighting a storage scalability issue in minutes rather than hours. The beneﬁt of this approach is that organizations that implement it commonly cut down their troubleshooting time significantly along with increasing the reliability of systems by detecting patterns early. This post explores how to build a custom event aggregation system that addresses these challenges, aligned to Kubernetes best practices. I&amp;rsquo;ve picked the Go programming language for my example. This event aggregation system consists of three main components: Here&amp;rsquo;s a sketch for how to implement the event watcher: The event processor enriches events with additional context and classification: One of the key features you could implement is a way of correlating related Events.</description></item><item><title>Introducing Serverless Inference on the GenAI Platform</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-06-09-introducing-serverless-inference-on-the-genai-platform/</link><pubDate>Mon, 09 Jun 2025 17:48:18 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-06-09-introducing-serverless-inference-on-the-genai-platform/</guid><description>By Grace Morgan DigitalOceanâs GenAI Platform is now DigitalOcean Gradient Platform.

Since its debut in 2014, Kubernetes has seen a meteoric rise in its adoption and popularity. Despite being a relatively new technology, it is now used by a vast number of organizations, from small start-ups to large enterprises, so much so that it has become a standard in the industry. Kubernetes benefits from strong community support and boasts a rich ecosystem of tools and extensions. It is continuously being developed and improved, and judging by the current trends, Kubernetes is only going to get stronger in the future. In this blog post, we’ll discuss why you should consider using Kubernetes , scenarios where Kubernetes might not be the ideal solution, and explore some of its alternatives. Let’s get started! Kubernetes offers several key features that cater to a wide range of application deployment and management needs. Here are the top three features of Kubernetes that make it particularly suitable for modern software development: In recent years, the microservices approach ( where software systems are developed as a collection of small, independent services ) has become increasingly popular in software development. Kubernetes provides many abstractions and APIs that are particularly well-suited to the requirements and characteristics of a microservices architecture. Here&amp;rsquo;s how Kubernetes simplifies the deployment and management of microservices: One of the standout features of Kubernetes is its ability to auto-scale applications in response to fluctuating traffic demands. When production systems experience spikes or drops in traffic, Kubernetes seamlessly steps in to adjust resources. It achieves this through two key scaling strategies: In addition to horizontal and vertical scaling, Kubernetes excels in cloud-based scalability, using a feature known as the Cluster Autoscaler.</description></item><item><title>Amazon EKS AWS Region expansion</title><link>https://kubermates.org/releases/2025-06-06-amazon-eks-aws-region-expansion/</link><pubDate>Fri, 06 Jun 2025 19:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/releases/2025-06-06-amazon-eks-aws-region-expansion/</guid><description>Help improve this page To contribute to this user guide, choose the Edit this page on GitHub link that is located in the right pane of every page.

This topic helps you to enable private access for your Amazon EKS clusterâs Kubernetes API server endpoint and limit, or completely disable, public access from the internet. When you create a new cluster, Amazon EKS creates an endpoint for the managed Kubernetes API server that you use to communicate with your cluster (using Kubernetes management tools such as kubectl ). By default, this API server endpoint is public to the internet, and access to the API server is secured using a combination of AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) and native Kubernetes Role Based Access Control (RBAC). This endpoint is known as the cluster public endpoint. Also there is a cluster private endpoint. For more information about the cluster private endpoint, see the following section Cluster private endpoint. EKS creates a unique dual-stack endpoint in the following format for new IPv6 clusters that are made after October 2024.

Unlike typical short-lived, stateless web requests, LLM inference sessions are often long-running, resource-intensive, and partially stateful. For example, a single GPU-backed model server may keep multiple inference sessions active and maintain in-memory token caches. Traditional load balancers focused on HTTP path or round-robin lack the specialized capabilities needed for these workloads. They also don’t account for model identity or request criticality (e. g. , interactive chat vs. batch jobs). Organizations often patch together ad-hoc solutions, but a standardized approach is missing. Gateway API Inference Extension was created to address this gap by building on the existing Gateway API , adding inference-specific routing capabilities while retaining the familiar model of Gateways and HTTPRoutes. By adding an inference extension to your existing gateway, you effectively transform it into an Inference Gateway , enabling you to self-host GenAI/LLMs with a “model-as-a-service” mindset. The project’s goal is to improve and standardize routing to inference workloads across the ecosystem.</description></item><item><title>Is It Time to Migrate? A Practical Look at Kubernetes Ingress vs. Gateway API</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-06-04-is-it-time-to-migrate-a-practical-look-at-kubernetes-ingress-vs-gateway-api/</link><pubDate>Wed, 04 Jun 2025 14:10:48 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-06-04-is-it-time-to-migrate-a-practical-look-at-kubernetes-ingress-vs-gateway-api/</guid><description>If you’ve managed traffic in Kubernetes, you’ve likely navigated the world of Ingress controllers. For years, Ingress has been the standard way of getting HTTP/S services exposed. But let’s be honest, it often felt like a compromise. We wrestled with controller-specific annotations to unlock critical features, blurred the lines between infrastructure and application concerns, this complexity didn’t just make portability more difficult, it sometimes led to security vulnerabilities and other complications. As part of Calico Open Source v3. 30 , we have released a free and open source Calico Ingress Gateway that implements a custom built Envoy proxy with the Kubernetes Gateway API standard to help you navigate Ingress complexities with style. This blog post is designed to get you up to speed on why such a change might be the missing link in your environment. The challenge with traditional Ingress wasn’t a lack of effort, since the landscape is full of innovative solutions. However, the problem was the lack of a unified, expressive, and role-aware standard. Existing ingress controllers were capable, implemented advanced features, however at the same time tied you to a specific project/vendor. This meant: This “Ingress rut” had tangible consequences. Platform teams struggled to enforce security standards and provide a consistent ingress experience.</description></item><item><title>Introducing ATL1: DigitalOcean’s new AI-optimized data center in Atlanta</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-06-03-introducing-atl1-digitalocean-s-new-ai-optimized-data-center-in-atlanta/</link><pubDate>Tue, 03 Jun 2025 12:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-06-03-introducing-atl1-digitalocean-s-new-ai-optimized-data-center-in-atlanta/</guid><description>By Grace Morgan Weâre excited to announce the launch of ATL1, DigitalOceanâs newest and largest data center, opening in Atlanta.

Hosted by Eric Durmishi and presented by Kyverno maintainers Mariam Fahmy and Charles Edward, the session introduced exciting new capabilities that enhance Kyverno’s flexibility and consistency as a policy engine for Kubernetes. At its core, Kyverno is a policy engine for Kubernetes. It enables you to define policies for validating, mutating, generating, or verifying images for resources within your cluster. When an API request, like creating a Pod, is sent to the Kubernetes API server, it passes through several stages, including authentication and authorization. Kyverno integrates as an admission webhook. The API request is forwarded to the Kyverno server, which fetches relevant policies, applies them to the resource, and then either accepts or rejects the request based on whether the resource violates the policy. Kyverno also includes components such as the Reports Controller, which generates policy reports to visualize policy results, and a Cleanup Controller, which manages unused resources based on cleanup policies. Traditionally, Kyverno used a single policy type with different rule types nested within it, such as validate, mutate, generate, and verifyImages. Policies could define rules to match or exclude specific resources. For validation, you could use patterns, deny rules, Pod Security subrules, or assertion trees.</description></item><item><title>No More kubectl Commands — Just Talk to Your Kubernetes Cluster in Natural Language</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-05-28-no-more-kubectl-commands-just-talk-to-your-kubernetes-cluster-in-natural-languag/</link><pubDate>Wed, 28 May 2025 17:52:01 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-05-28-no-more-kubectl-commands-just-talk-to-your-kubernetes-cluster-in-natural-languag/</guid><description>What if you could just ask: &amp;raquo;&amp;gt; how&amp;rsquo;s my nginx app doing? …and your terminal figured out the rest? Thanks to kubectl-ai , Kubernetes can now understand natural language. You type what you want in plain English, and it responds by executing real, context-aware kubectl commands — without needing to memorize flags, write YAML, or guess namespaces. Let’s explore how this works in action. Before you can chat with your cluster, make sure you have the basics in place: The fastest way (Linux &amp;amp; macOS): Skip the manual steps and install in one line: curl -sSL https://raw. githubusercontent. com/GoogleCloudPlatform/kubectl-ai/main/install. sh | bash You’ll be ready to talk to your cluster in under a minute. Prefer to do it yourself? Manual install (Linux, macOS, Windows): Already a kubectl power user? Install with Krew (Linux/macOS/Windows): If you use Krew (the plugin manager for kubectl), installation is a breeze: Now, just invoke it as a kubectl plugin: No matter which method you choose, you’ll be ready to type natural language commands and let kubectl-ai handle the rest. No more memorizing flags, no more YAML wrangling—just pure, conversational Kubernetes. Ready to see kubectl-ai in action? Now that setup is out of the way, it’s time to experience the magic of conversational Kubernetes firsthand. Let’s dive in: Instead of juggling flags and memorizing resource names, just type your question—kubectl-ai will handle the rest. Note: The following examples are run on a Windows system using the OpenAI GPT-4o model, but kubectl-ai works just as smoothly across platforms and with other LLM providers.</description></item><item><title>May 27, 2025</title><link>https://kubermates.org/releases/2025-05-27-may-27-2025/</link><pubDate>Tue, 27 May 2025 00:00:00 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/releases/2025-05-27-may-27-2025/</guid><description>This page includes release notes for all channels and releases.

Leveraging multiple technologies for networking and security for in-cluster, ingress, egress, and traffic across clusters creates challenges, including operational complexities and increased costs. For example, to manage ingress traffic for Kubernetes clusters, users cobble together multiple solutions from different providers such as ingress controllers or gateways and load balancers for routing traffic, as well as Web Application Firewalls (WAFs) for enhanced security. Despite the challenges it brings, deploying disparate technologies has been a “necessary evil” for organizations to get all the capabilities needed for holistic Kubernetes networking. Here, we’ll explore challenges this proliferation of tooling introduces, and provide actionable tips for today’s platform and security teams to overcome these issues. The fragmented approach to networking and network security in Kubernetes leads to challenges and inefficiencies, including: Take managing ingress traffic, and everything that goes with it. It is typical in a Kubernetes environment, that a user might need to manage multiple tools and services, such as cloud provider load balancers, application gateways, and ingress controllers like NGINX or others, to enable traffic flow and security. This can lead to complexity and fragmentation when integrating these components across your cloud infrastructure and Kubernetes clusters. The user is then required to learn about these individual tools, how they work, what their API is, how to manage them, deploy them, and troubleshoot them. And when it comes to troubleshooting, different sources for logging leads to issues identifying the source of an issue—and, in turn, challenges remediating said issue. Organizations can address these challenges by adopting a unified approach to Kubernetes networking. Deploying a single, unified solution for Kubernetes networking from the application to the networking layer eliminates the need for separate tools to manage ingress, egress, in-cluster, and cross-cluster traffic, significantly simplifying operations and reducing costs without compromising performance or security.</description></item><item><title>Add-on support for Amazon FSx CSI driver</title><link>https://kubermates.org/releases/2025-05-23-add-on-support-for-amazon-fsx-csi-driver/</link><pubDate>Fri, 23 May 2025 19:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/releases/2025-05-23-add-on-support-for-amazon-fsx-csi-driver/</guid><description>Help improve this page To contribute to this user guide, choose the Edit this page on GitHub link that is located in the right pane of every page.

The launch of ChatGPT was a seminal moment in the evolution of AI, and since then, AIâs adoption has accelerated. According to â The rapid adoption of Generative AI. Bick, Blandin, &amp;amp; Deming (2024 )â, AI is being adopted at twice the rate of the PC and internet at a similar point in their evolution. Not just adoption, the rate of innovation in AI has been faster than anything we have seen before. So where is AI headed? To answer this question, let us start by looking at how other transformational technologies have evolved throughout history. Take the Internet for example â it started with the infrastructure - with routers and network switches. But the true inflection point came with the emergence of platform capabilities, such as web browsers and HTML, which allowed people to build and use applications like search engines, e-commerce, and social media. If you look at the PC, microprocessors and memory and other infrastructure components came first. But what triggered the massive adoption was the creation of a platform â WinTel, which provided a standardized environment for developing and running PC applications. Same with the smartphones; the infrastructure started first with modems and cell towers, but it really took off when a platform enabled the creation and use of applications. AI will follow a similar IPA ( I nfrastructure -&amp;gt; P latform -&amp;gt; A pplication) model, with the innovation moving from Infrastructure (e.</description></item><item><title>Kubernetes v1.33: In-Place Pod Resize Graduated to Beta</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-05-16-kubernetes-v1-33-in-place-pod-resize-graduated-to-beta/</link><pubDate>Fri, 16 May 2025 10:30:00 -0800</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-05-16-kubernetes-v1-33-in-place-pod-resize-graduated-to-beta/</guid><description>On behalf of the Kubernetes project, I am excited to announce that the in-place Pod resize feature (also known as In-Place Pod Vertical Scaling), first introduced as alpha in Kubernetes v1. 27, has graduated to Beta and will be enabled by default in the Kubernetes v1. 33 release! This marks a significant milestone in making resource management for Kubernetes workloads more flexible and less disruptive. Traditionally, changing the CPU or memory resources allocated to a container required restarting the Pod. While acceptable for many stateless applications, this could be disruptive for stateful services, batch jobs, or any workloads sensitive to restarts. In-place Pod resizing allows you to change the CPU and memory requests and limits assigned to containers within a running Pod, often without requiring a container restart. Here&amp;rsquo;s the core idea: You can try it out on a v1. 33 Kubernetes cluster by using kubectl to edit a Pod (requires kubectl v1. 32+): For detailed usage instructions and examples, please refer to the official Kubernetes documentation: Resize CPU and Memory Resources assigned to Containers. Kubernetes still excels at scaling workloads horizontally (adding or removing replicas), but in-place Pod resizing unlocks several key benefits for vertical scaling: Since the alpha release in v1. 27, significant work has gone into maturing the feature, improving its stability, and refining the user experience based on feedback and further development. Here are the key changes: Graduating to Beta means the feature is ready for broader adoption, but development doesn&amp;rsquo;t stop here! Here&amp;rsquo;s what the community is focusing on next: With the InPlacePodVerticalScaling feature gate enabled by default in v1.</description></item><item><title>May 16, 2025</title><link>https://kubermates.org/releases/2025-05-16-may-16-2025/</link><pubDate>Fri, 16 May 2025 00:00:00 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/releases/2025-05-16-may-16-2025/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Open the original post ↗ &lt;a href="https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/release-notes#May_16_2025"&gt;https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/release-notes#May_16_2025&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Announcing etcd v3.6.0</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-05-15-announcing-etcd-v3-6-0/</link><pubDate>Thu, 15 May 2025 16:00:00 -0800</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-05-15-announcing-etcd-v3-6-0/</guid><description>This announcement originally appeared on the etcd blog.

In batch workloads, you might want to use leader-follower patterns like MPI , in which the leader controls the execution, including the followers&amp;rsquo; lifecycle. In this case, you might want to mark it as succeeded even if some of the indexes failed. Unfortunately, a leader-follower Kubernetes Job that didn&amp;rsquo;t use a success policy, in most cases, would have to require all Pods to finish successfully for that Job to reach an overall succeeded state. For Kubernetes Jobs, the API allows you to specify the early exit criteria using the. spec. successPolicy field (you can only use the. spec. successPolicy field for an indexed Job ). Which describes a set of rules either using a list of succeeded indexes for a job, or defining a minimal required size of succeeded indexes. This newly stable field is especially valuable for scientific simulation, AI/ML and High-Performance Computing (HPC) batch workloads.</description></item><item><title>Kubernetes v1.33: Updates to Container Lifecycle</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-05-14-kubernetes-v1-33-updates-to-container-lifecycle/</link><pubDate>Wed, 14 May 2025 10:30:00 -0800</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-05-14-kubernetes-v1-33-updates-to-container-lifecycle/</guid><description>Kubernetes v1. 33 introduces a few updates to the lifecycle of containers. The Sleep action for container lifecycle hooks now supports a zero sleep duration (feature enabled by default). There is also alpha support for customizing the stop signal sent to containers when they are being terminated. This blog post goes into the details of these new aspects of the container lifecycle, and how you can use them. Kubernetes v1. 29 introduced the Sleep action for container PreStop and PostStart Lifecycle hooks. The Sleep action lets your containers pause for a specified duration after the container is started or before it is terminated. This was needed to provide a straightforward way to manage graceful shutdowns. Before the Sleep action, folks used to run the sleep command using the exec action in their container lifecycle hooks. If you wanted to do this you&amp;rsquo;d need to have the binary for the sleep command in your container image. This is difficult if you&amp;rsquo;re using third party images.</description></item><item><title>Automate Policy Violation Tracking with Jira in Nirmata Control Hub</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-05-14-automate-policy-violation-tracking-with-jira-in-nirmata-control-hub/</link><pubDate>Wed, 14 May 2025 10:08:17 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-05-14-automate-policy-violation-tracking-with-jira-in-nirmata-control-hub/</guid><description>Keeping track of Kubernetes policy violations across namespaces and clusters can be tedious, especially when teams rely on disconnected tools and manual workflows. With Nirmata Control Hub’s Jira integration, you can automatically or manually create Jira tickets for policy violations directly from the platform. This ensures accountability, reduces MTTR (mean time to resolution), and improves team productivity by embedding policy compliance into your teams’ tools. Every misconfiguration or policy violation is a potential security or compliance risk. However, identifying issues is only the first step. The real value is in closing the loop—from detection to resolution. Traditionally, teams rely on Slack alerts, dashboards, or Excel exports to track violations. But these quickly fall out of sync with what’s happening in the cluster or Git. Hira is where real work happens, and that’s where Nirmata Control Hub (NCH) now meets your team. From any Policy Reports page, users can instantly generate a Jira issue for violations. Simply click “Create Jira Issue” and fill in the ticket details, such as project, title, issue type, priority, and assignee. This creates traceability right at the source of the ossie, whether it;s a misconfigured deployment, a missing securityContext, or a policy deviation.</description></item><item><title>Why Policy as Code is a Game Changer for Platform Engineers</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-05-13-why-policy-as-code-is-a-game-changer-for-platform-engineers/</link><pubDate>Tue, 13 May 2025 20:07:21 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-05-13-why-policy-as-code-is-a-game-changer-for-platform-engineers/</guid><description>Platform engineers, let’s talk about a fundamental shift that’s revolutionizing how we build and manage internal developer platforms: Policy as Code (PaC). This isn’t just another buzzword; it’s the key to creating scalable, secure, and efficient operations that empower developers. Let’s dive in! Platform engineers, let’s talk about a fundamental shift that’s revolutionizing how we build and manage internal developer platforms: Policy as Code (PaC). This isn’t just another buzzword; it’s the key to creating scalable, secure, and efficient operations that empower developers. Let’s dive in! Policy as Code drastically improves developer experience. By implementing policy checks early in the development process (“shifting left”), developers get instant feedback on potential issues. This prevents problems from reaching production and reduces mental load, allowing them to focus on innovation, not compliance headaches. Platform engineering is about giving developers self-service capabilities. Infrastructure as Code (IaC) provides automation, but Policy as Code (PaC) provides the critical guardrails. Developers can provision resources and deploy applications within defined “golden paths,” ensuring agility without compromising security or compliance. Policies written as code are stored in version control, creating a clear history of changes. This auditability is essential for troubleshooting and demonstrating compliance.</description></item><item><title>Kubernetes v1.33: Job's Backoff Limit Per Index Goes GA</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-05-13-kubernetes-v1-33-job-s-backoff-limit-per-index-goes-ga/</link><pubDate>Tue, 13 May 2025 10:30:00 -0800</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-05-13-kubernetes-v1-33-job-s-backoff-limit-per-index-goes-ga/</guid><description>In Kubernetes v1. 33, the Backoff Limit Per Index feature reaches general availability (GA). This blog describes the Backoff Limit Per Index feature and its benefits. When you run workloads on Kubernetes, you must consider scenarios where Pod failures can affect the completion of your workloads. Ideally, your workload should tolerate transient failures and continue running. To achieve failure tolerance in a Kubernetes Job, you can set the spec. backoffLimit field. This field specifies the total number of tolerated failures. However, for workloads where every index is considered independent, like embarassingly parallel workloads - the spec. backoffLimit field is often not flexible enough. For example, you may choose to run multiple suites of integration tests by representing each suite as an index within an Indexed Job. In that setup, a fast-failing index (test suite) is likely to consume your entire budget for tolerating Pod failures, and you might not be able to run the other indexes.</description></item><item><title>May 13, 2025</title><link>https://kubermates.org/releases/2025-05-13-may-13-2025/</link><pubDate>Tue, 13 May 2025 00:00:00 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/releases/2025-05-13-may-13-2025/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Open the original post ↗ &lt;a href="https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/release-notes#May_13_2025"&gt;https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/release-notes#May_13_2025&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Kubernetes v1.33: Image Pull Policy the way you always thought it worked!</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-05-12-kubernetes-v1-33-image-pull-policy-the-way-you-always-thought-it-worked/</link><pubDate>Mon, 12 May 2025 10:30:00 -0800</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-05-12-kubernetes-v1-33-image-pull-policy-the-way-you-always-thought-it-worked/</guid><description>Some things in Kubernetes are surprising, and the way imagePullPolicy behaves might be one of them. Given Kubernetes is all about running pods, it may be peculiar to learn that there has been a caveat to restricting pod access to authenticated images for over 10 years in the form of issue 18787 ! It is an exciting release when you can resolve a ten-year-old issue. The gist of the problem is that the imagePullPolicy: IfNotPresent strategy has done precisely what it says, and nothing more. Let&amp;rsquo;s set up a scenario. To begin, Pod A in Namespace X is scheduled to Node 1 and requires image Foo from a private repository. For it&amp;rsquo;s image pull authentication material, the pod references Secret 1 in its imagePullSecrets. Secret 1 contains the necessary credentials to pull from the private repository. The Kubelet will utilize the credentials from Secret 1 as supplied by Pod A and it will pull container image Foo from the registry. This is the intended (and secure) behavior. But now things get curious. If Pod B in Namespace Y happens to also be scheduled to Node 1 , unexpected (and potentially insecure) things happen. Pod B may reference the same private image, specifying the IfNotPresent image pull policy.</description></item><item><title>How to optimize your cloud architecture for business growth</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-05-09-how-to-optimize-your-cloud-architecture-for-business-growth/</link><pubDate>Fri, 09 May 2025 23:25:48 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-05-09-how-to-optimize-your-cloud-architecture-for-business-growth/</guid><description>By Anantha Ramachandran Principal Product Marketing Manager Your cloud setup is like a ship on the ocean.

One of the most challenging aspects of operating large-scale clusters has been handling List requests that fetch substantial datasets - a common operation that could unexpectedly impact your cluster&amp;rsquo;s stability. Today, the Kubernetes community is excited to announce a significant architectural improvement: streaming encoding for List responses. Current API response encoders just serialize an entire response into a single contiguous memory and perform one ResponseWriter. Write call to transmit data to the client. Despite HTTP/2&amp;rsquo;s capability to split responses into smaller frames for transmission, the underlying HTTP server continues to hold the complete response data as a single buffer. Even as individual frames are transmitted to the client, the memory associated with these frames cannot be freed incrementally. When cluster size grows, the single response body can be substantial - like hundreds of megabytes in size. At large scale, the current approach becomes particularly inefficient, as it prevents incremental memory release during transmission. Imagining that when network congestion occurs, that large response body’s memory block stays active for tens of seconds or even minutes. This limitation leads to unnecessarily high and prolonged memory consumption in the kube-apiserver process. If multiple large List requests occur simultaneously, the cumulative memory consumption can escalate rapidly, potentially leading to an Out-of-Memory (OOM) situation that compromises cluster stability.</description></item><item><title>Kubernetes 1.33: Volume Populators Graduate to GA</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-05-08-kubernetes-1-33-volume-populators-graduate-to-ga/</link><pubDate>Thu, 08 May 2025 10:30:00 -0800</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-05-08-kubernetes-1-33-volume-populators-graduate-to-ga/</guid><description>Kubernetes volume populators are now generally available (GA)! The AnyVolumeDataSource feature gate is treated as always enabled for Kubernetes v1. 33, which means that users can specify any appropriate custom resource as the data source of a PersistentVolumeClaim (PVC). An example of how to use dataSourceRef in PVC: There are four major enhancements from beta. During the beta phase, contributors to Kubernetes identified potential resource leaks with PersistentVolumeClaim (PVC) deletion while volume population was in progress; these leaks happened due to limitations in finalizer handling. Ahead of the graduation to general availability, the Kubernetes project added support to delete temporary resources (PVC prime, etc. ) if the original PVC is deleted. To accommodate this, we&amp;rsquo;ve introduced three new plugin-based functions: A provider example is added in lib-volume-populator/example. For GA, the CSI volume populator controller code gained a MutatorConfig , allowing the specification of mutator functions to modify Kubernetes resources. For example, if the PVC prime is not an exact copy of the PVC and you need provider-specific information for the driver, you can include this information in the optional MutatorConfig. This allows you to customize the Kubernetes objects in the volume populator. Our beta phase highlighted a new requirement: the need to aggregate metrics not just from lib-volume-populator, but also from other components within the provider&amp;rsquo;s codebase. To address this, SIG Storage introduced a provider metric manager.</description></item><item><title>Expanding our GPU Droplet portfolio - NVIDIA RTX 4000 Ada Generation, NVIDIA RTX 6000 Ada Generation, and NVIDIA L40S</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-05-08-expanding-our-gpu-droplet-portfolio-nvidia-rtx-4000-ada-generation-nvidia-rtx-60/</link><pubDate>Thu, 08 May 2025 08:05:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-05-08-expanding-our-gpu-droplet-portfolio-nvidia-rtx-4000-ada-generation-nvidia-rtx-60/</guid><description>By Waverly Swinton GPU Droplets are now DigitalOcean GradientAI GPU Droplets.

By keeping infrastructure and cost management simple, the Hatch program helps enable startups to build solutions that move society forward. Ontra Mobility , a Y Combinator startup, transforms communities by developing data-driven tools that help cities and transit agencies plan and operate more efficient, equitable, and sustainable transportation systems, focusing on optimizing networks and improving first-and-last mile access through on-demand ridesharing. We sat down with CTO Connor Riley, who chose DigitalOcean for its simple, managed infrastructure so they can focus on making public transit more accessible. The Hatch program provided credits and resources that helped support their mission. During their PhD programs at Georgia Institute of Technology, Riley and his co-founder Anthony Trasatti worked with their academic advisor, Pascal Van Hentenryck, to optimize public transit, which serves as a vital lifeline for many. Working closely with MARTA in Atlanta, GA, they developed techniques for network design optimization, special events scheduling, and dispatching algorithms for on-demand ridesharing. These projects powered on-demand ridesharing pilots MARTA Reach and CAT SMART in Savannah, Georgia. Getting adoption for a product that serves public agencies is as much of a battle as building the product itself. Since many residents rely on public transportation, establishing trust with transit agencies is essential before theyâll risk adopting new products that could impact municipal residents. Despite these hurdles, theyâre undeterred: theyâve already gained traction with a number of customers, including conducting a microtransit planning project in Washington D.

A prime example of this shift is the transition of Kubernetes Service Account (KSA) tokens from long-lived, static tokens to ephemeral, automatically rotated tokens with OpenID Connect (OIDC)-compliant semantics. This advancement enables workloads to securely authenticate with external services without needing persistent secrets. However, one major gap remains: image pull authentication. Today, Kubernetes clusters rely on image pull secrets stored in the API, which are long-lived and difficult to rotate, or on node-level kubelet credential providers, which allow any pod running on a node to access the same credentials. This presents security and operational challenges. To address this, Kubernetes is introducing Service Account Token Integration for Kubelet Credential Providers , now available in alpha. This enhancement allows credential providers to use pod-specific service account tokens to obtain registry credentials, which kubelet can then use for image pulls — eliminating the need for long-lived image pull secrets. Currently, Kubernetes administrators have two primary options for handling private container image pulls: Image pull secrets stored in the Kubernetes API Kubelet credential providers Neither approach aligns with the principles of least privilege or ephemeral authentication , leaving Kubernetes with a security gap. This new enhancement enables kubelet credential providers to use workload identity when fetching image registry credentials. Instead of relying on long-lived secrets, credential providers can use service account tokens to request short-lived credentials tied to a specific pod’s identity. This approach provides: Kubelet generates short-lived, automatically rotated tokens for service accounts if the credential provider it communicates with has opted into receiving a service account token for image pulls.</description></item><item><title>Do You Need a Degree to Be a DevOps Engineer?

These new roles include the pre-defined roles of â readOnly â, â readWrite â and â dbAdmin â. Learn more about it here. This update brings greater security, efficiency, and compliance to your MongoDB clusters. With predefined roles, you can now easily manage access control, reduce security risks, and streamline database administration across your MongoDB clusters on DigitalOcean. Managing database access can be a challenge, especially as teams grow and security requirements become more complex. Without a structured approach, organizations risk unauthorized access, operational inefficiencies, and compliance gaps. With RBAC now applicable to your MongoDB environment, you can enforce clear, predefined access policiesâhelping to ensure secure, efficient, and scalable database management. Hereâs how RBAC can benefit your business: Enhanced security: RBAC protects against unauthorized access by only allowing verified users to interact with sensitive database resources. This reduces the risk of data breaches and strengthens overall security posture. Operational efficiency: With predefined roles, administrators can streamline user provisioning and de-provisioning, minimizing the manual workload and reducing errors. Improved compliance: RBAC helps organizations meet industry standards and regulatory requirements by enforcing structured access controls, making audits and reporting more straightforward. Cost savings: By automating user access management, RBAC reduces administrative overhead and lowers the risk of security breaches, which can be costly to remediate.</description></item><item><title>Kubernetes v1.33: Fine-grained SupplementalGroups Control Graduates to Beta</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-05-06-kubernetes-v1-33-fine-grained-supplementalgroups-control-graduates-to-beta/</link><pubDate>Tue, 06 May 2025 10:30:00 -0800</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-05-06-kubernetes-v1-33-fine-grained-supplementalgroups-control-graduates-to-beta/</guid><description>The new field, supplementalGroupsPolicy , was introduced as an opt-in alpha feature for Kubernetes v1. 31 and has graduated to beta in v1. 33; the corresponding feature gate ( SupplementalGroupsPolicy ) is now enabled by default. This feature enables to implement more precise control over supplemental groups in containers that can strengthen the security posture, particularly in accessing volumes. Moreover, it also enhances the transparency of UID/GID details in containers, offering improved security oversight. Please be aware that this beta release contains some behavioral breaking change. See The Behavioral Changes Introduced In Beta and Upgrade Considerations sections for details. Although the majority of Kubernetes cluster admins/users may not be aware, kubernetes, by default, merges group information from the Pod with information defined in /etc/group in the container image. Let&amp;rsquo;s see an example, below Pod manifest specifies runAsUser=1000 , runAsGroup=3000 and supplementalGroups=4000 in the Pod&amp;rsquo;s security context. What is the result of id command in the ctr container? The output should be similar to this: Where does group ID 50000 in supplementary groups ( groups field) come from, even though 50000 is not defined in the Pod&amp;rsquo;s manifest at all? The answer is /etc/group file in the container image. Checking the contents of /etc/group in the container image should show below: This shows that the container&amp;rsquo;s primary user 1000 belongs to the group 50000 in the last entry. Thus, the group membership defined in /etc/group in the container image for the container&amp;rsquo;s primary user is implicitly merged to the information from the Pod.</description></item><item><title>Nirmata’s AI-Powered Remediations: A Smarter Way to Fix Policy Violations</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-05-06-nirmata-s-ai-powered-remediations-a-smarter-way-to-fix-policy-violations/</link><pubDate>Tue, 06 May 2025 18:25:24 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-05-06-nirmata-s-ai-powered-remediations-a-smarter-way-to-fix-policy-violations/</guid><description>Every modern enterprise strives for faster software delivery without compromising on security and compliance. As cloud-native environments grow in scale and complexity, so does the burden of identifying and fixing misconfigurations across clusters, pipelines, and cloud infrastructure. Today, we’re excited to announce a major leap forward in our mission to simplify cloud governance: AI-Powered Remediations , which is now available in preview in Nirmata Control Hub (NCH). Security and platform teams often face a growing backlog of policy violations—from missing labels to insecure container configurations to overly permissive network rules. Manually investigating each violation, understanding its root cause, and crafting a compliant fix takes time—and that time adds up. With AI Remediations, we’re dramatically reducing the Mean Time to Remediation (MTTR ). Instead of spending hours chasing down documentation or writing YAML from scratch, teams can now review and apply context-aware fixes in minutes. And the benefits go beyond speed: Whether it’s a Deployment, ConfigMap, NetworkPolicy, or any Kubernetes resource, if it violates a rule enforced by your Kyverno policies in NCH, we can generate a fix. Here’s how: Transparency by design: We don’t just tell you what to change – we explain why. You stay in control, with the ability to test and validate before deployment. AI Remediations aren’t about removing humans from the loop—they’re about giving your teams a smarter starting point. Think of them as policy-aware code suggestions that plug right into your existing workflows.</description></item><item><title>Mainframes Are the New AI Infrastructure.

And as enterprises begin to deploy containerized AI workloads on Red Hat OpenShift for mainframe environments, that priority becomes even more urgent. IBM Z and IBM LinuxONE, long trusted to power the world’s most critical business systems are now evolving into innovation hubs, supporting advanced, containerized applications. With this transformation comes a new challenge: securing the infrastructure behind your most sensitive and high-stakes workloads The rise of generative AI and large language models (LLMs) has changed how organizations build and deliver value. From real-time fraud detection to intelligent customer support, AI is becoming embedded in nearly every business function. According to a recent McKinsey study , “ 78 percent of respondents say their organizations use AI in at least one business function, up from 72 percent in early 2024. ” These AI workloads are built and deployed in containers. Why? Containers offer portability, scalability, and efficiency, which makes them ideal for AI training, inference, and everything in between. IDC projects that 1 billion new logical applications will be created by 2028, resulting in more than 10 billion container instances across enterprise environments. These billions of containers won’t just run in a general purpose cloud. They will be deployed on purpose built hardware. For regulatory, proprietary, or even cost reasons, many of these models will be deployed on-prem.</description></item><item><title>Kubernetes v1.33: Prevent PersistentVolume Leaks When Deleting out of Order graduates to GA</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-05-05-kubernetes-v1-33-prevent-persistentvolume-leaks-when-deleting-out-of-order-gradu/</link><pubDate>Mon, 05 May 2025 10:30:00 -0800</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-05-05-kubernetes-v1-33-prevent-persistentvolume-leaks-when-deleting-out-of-order-gradu/</guid><description>I am thrilled to announce that the feature to prevent PersistentVolume (or PVs for short) leaks when deleting out of order has graduated to General Availability (GA) in Kubernetes v1. 33! This improvement, initially introduced as a beta feature in Kubernetes v1. 31, ensures that your storage resources are properly reclaimed, preventing unwanted leaks. PersistentVolumeClaim (or PVC for short) is a user&amp;rsquo;s request for storage. A PV and PVC are considered Bound if a newly created PV or a matching PV is found. The PVs themselves are backed by volumes allocated by the storage backend. Normally, if the volume is to be deleted, then the expectation is to delete the PVC for a bound PV-PVC pair. However, there are no restrictions on deleting a PV before deleting a PVC. For a Bound PV-PVC pair, the ordering of PV-PVC deletion determines whether the PV reclaim policy is honored. The reclaim policy is honored if the PVC is deleted first; however, if the PV is deleted prior to deleting the PVC, then the reclaim policy is not exercised. As a result of this behavior, the associated storage asset in the external infrastructure is not removed. With the graduation to GA in Kubernetes v1.</description></item><item><title>Nirmata Enterprise for Kyverno (N4K) Now Available on AWS Marketplace!</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-05-05-nirmata-enterprise-for-kyverno-n4k-now-available-on-aws-marketplace/</link><pubDate>Mon, 05 May 2025 17:55:11 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-05-05-nirmata-enterprise-for-kyverno-n4k-now-available-on-aws-marketplace/</guid><description>We are thrilled to announce that Nirmata Enterprise for Kyverno (N4K) is now available on AWS Marketplace !

Kubernetes v1. 33 introduces an alpha feature called mutable CSI node allocatable count , allowing Container Storage Interface (CSI) drivers to dynamically update the reported maximum number of volumes that a node can handle. This capability significantly enhances the accuracy of pod scheduling decisions and reduces scheduling failures caused by outdated volume capacity information. Traditionally, Kubernetes CSI drivers report a static maximum volume attachment limit when initializing. However, actual attachment capacities can change during a node&amp;rsquo;s lifecycle for various reasons, such as: Static reporting can cause Kubernetes to schedule pods onto nodes that appear to have capacity but don&amp;rsquo;t, leading to pods stuck in a ContainerCreating state. With the new feature gate MutableCSINodeAllocatableCount , Kubernetes enables CSI drivers to dynamically adjust and report node attachment capacities at runtime. This ensures that the scheduler has the most accurate, up-to-date view of node capacity. When this feature is enabled, Kubernetes supports two mechanisms for updating the reported node volume limits: To use this alpha feature, you must enable the MutableCSINodeAllocatableCount feature gate in these components: Below is an example of configuring a CSI driver to enable periodic updates every 60 seconds: This configuration directs Kubelet to periodically call the CSI driver&amp;rsquo;s NodeGetInfo method every 60 seconds, updating the node’s allocatable volume count. Kubernetes enforces a minimum update interval of 10 seconds to balance accuracy and resource usage. In addition to periodic updates, Kubernetes now reacts to attachment failures. Specifically, if a volume attachment fails with a ResourceExhausted error (gRPC code 8 ), an immediate update is triggered to correct the allocatable count promptly.</description></item><item><title>Kubernetes v1.33: New features in DRA</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-05-01-kubernetes-v1-33-new-features-in-dra/</link><pubDate>Thu, 01 May 2025 10:30:00 -0800</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-05-01-kubernetes-v1-33-new-features-in-dra/</guid><description>Kubernetes Dynamic Resource Allocation (DRA) was originally introduced as an alpha feature in the v1. 26 release, and then went through a significant redesign for Kubernetes v1. 31.

This feature adds a scoring method for pod scheduling with the topology-aware volume provisioning. This feature eases to schedule pods on nodes with either the most or least available storage capacity. This feature extends the kube-scheduler&amp;rsquo;s VolumeBinding plugin to perform scoring using node storage capacity information obtained from Storage Capacity. Currently, you can only filter out nodes with insufficient storage capacity. So, you have to use a scheduler extender to achieve storage-capacity-based pod scheduling. This feature is useful for provisioning node-local PVs, which have size limits based on the node&amp;rsquo;s storage capacity. By using this feature, you can assign the PVs to the nodes with the most available storage space so that you can expand the PVs later as much as possible. In another use case, you might want to reduce the number of nodes as much as possible for low operation costs in cloud environments by choosing the least storage capacity node. This feature helps maximize resource utilization by filling up nodes more sequentially, starting with the most utilized nodes first that still have enough storage capacity for the requested volume size. In the alpha phase, StorageCapacityScoring is disabled by default.</description></item><item><title>AI agent development just got easier on GenAI Platform</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-04-30-ai-agent-development-just-got-easier-on-genai-platform/</link><pubDate>Wed, 30 Apr 2025 15:30:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-04-30-ai-agent-development-just-got-easier-on-genai-platform/</guid><description>By Grace Morgan DigitalOceanâs GenAI Platform is now DigitalOcean Gradient Platform.

Horizontal Pod Autoscaling is a well-known Kubernetes feature that allows your workload to automatically resize by adding or removing replicas based on resource utilization. Let&amp;rsquo;s say you have a web application running in a Kubernetes cluster with 50 replicas. You configure the HorizontalPodAutoscaler (HPA) to scale based on CPU utilization, with a target of 75% utilization. Now, imagine that the current CPU utilization across all replicas is 90%, which is higher than the desired 75%. The HPA will calculate the required number of replicas using the formula: In this example: So, the HPA will increase the number of replicas from 50 to 60 to reduce the load on each pod. Similarly, if the CPU utilization were to drop below 75%, the HPA would scale down the number of replicas accordingly. The Kubernetes documentation provides a detailed description of the scaling algorithm. In order to avoid replicas being created or deleted whenever a small metric fluctuation occurs, Kubernetes applies a form of hysteresis: it only changes the number of replicas when the current and desired metric values differ by more than 10%. In the example above, since the ratio between the current and desired metric values is (90/75), or 20% above target, exceeding the 10% tolerance, the scale-up action will proceed. This default tolerance of 10% is cluster-wide; in older Kubernetes releases, it could not be fine-tuned.</description></item><item><title>Kubernetes v1.33: User Namespaces enabled by default!</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-04-25-kubernetes-v1-33-user-namespaces-enabled-by-default/</link><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 10:30:00 -0800</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-04-25-kubernetes-v1-33-user-namespaces-enabled-by-default/</guid><description>In Kubernetes v1. 33 support for user namespaces is enabled by default. This means that, when the stack requirements are met, pods can opt-in to use user namespaces. To use the feature there is no need to enable any Kubernetes feature flag anymore! In this blog post we answer some common questions about user namespaces. But, before we dive into that, let&amp;rsquo;s recap what user namespaces are and why they are important. Note: Linux user namespaces are a different concept from Kubernetes namespaces. The former is a Linux kernel feature; the latter is a Kubernetes feature. Linux provides different namespaces to isolate processes from each other. For example, a typical Kubernetes pod runs within a network namespace to isolate the network identity and a PID namespace to isolate the processes. One Linux namespace that was left behind is the user namespace. It isolates the UIDs and GIDs of the containers from the ones on the host. The identifiers in a container can be mapped to identifiers on the host in a way where host and container(s) never end up in overlapping UID/GIDs.</description></item><item><title>Introducing DigitalOcean Managed Caching for Valkey, The New Evolution of Managed Caching</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-04-24-introducing-digitalocean-managed-caching-for-valkey-the-new-evolution-of-managed/</link><pubDate>Thu, 24 Apr 2025 20:16:49 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-04-24-introducing-digitalocean-managed-caching-for-valkey-the-new-evolution-of-managed/</guid><description>By Nicole Ghalwash Today, weâre excited to announce the launch of DigitalOceanâs Managed Caching for Valkey, our new Managed Database service that seamlessly replaces Managed Caching (previously Managed RedisÂ®).

New Service features like dual-stack networking and traffic distribution are only supported via the EndpointSlice API, so all service proxies, Gateway API implementations, and similar controllers have had to be ported from using Endpoints to using EndpointSlices. At this point, the Endpoints API is really only there to avoid breaking end user workloads and scripts that still make use of it. As of Kubernetes 1. 33, the Endpoints API is now officially deprecated, and the API server will return warnings to users who read or write Endpoints resources rather than using EndpointSlices. Eventually, the plan (as documented in KEP-4974 ) is to change the Kubernetes Conformance criteria to no longer require that clusters run the Endpoints controller (which generates Endpoints objects based on Services and Pods), to avoid doing work that is unneeded in most modern-day clusters. Thus, while the Kubernetes deprecation policy means that the Endpoints type itself will probably never completely go away, users who still have workloads or scripts that use the Endpoints API should start migrating them to EndpointSlices. For end users, the biggest change between the Endpoints API and the EndpointSlice API is that while every Service with a selector has exactly 1 Endpoints object (with the same name as the Service), a Service may have any number of EndpointSlices associated with it: In this case, because the service is dual stack, it has 2 EndpointSlices: 1 for IPv4 addresses and 1 for IPv6 addresses. (The Endpoints API does not support dual stack, so the Endpoints object shows only the addresses in the cluster&amp;rsquo;s primary address family. ) Although any Service with multiple endpoints can have multiple EndpointSlices, there are three main cases where you will see this: An EndpointSlice can only represent endpoints of a single IP family, so dual-stack Services will have separate EndpointSlices for IPv4 and IPv6.</description></item><item><title>DigitalOcean Customers Eligible to Process DORA Workloads</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-04-24-digitalocean-customers-eligible-to-process-dora-workloads/</link><pubDate>Thu, 24 Apr 2025 12:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-04-24-digitalocean-customers-eligible-to-process-dora-workloads/</guid><description>By David Lopez Staff Trust &amp;amp; Governance Advisor, Trust and Governance Today, weâre excited to announce that DigitalOcean will begin signing Digital Operational Resilience Act (DORA) Addendums with eligible customers. Additionally, we engaged Schellman &amp;amp; Company to facilitate an audit of our environment, so that customers can deploy on DigitalOcean with trust in the organizationâs risk management, security controls, operational resilience, incident management and reporting, and outsourcing and third party risk management. Effective January 17, 2025, financial entities operating in the European Union (EU) and Information and Communications Technology (ICT) third-party service providers are subject to the EUâs DORA.

As AI adoption scales and environments grow more complex, so too do the risks, especially at runtime, where traditional tools struggle to provide meaningful visibility. These are not legacy exploits like port scans or brute force attempts. Attackers are targeting what happens inside your environment, at runtime, where misconfigurations, unexpected behaviors, and subtle anomalies can quietly introduce business risk. Yet most security teams are flying blind in production. They have tools that check for vulnerabilities before deployment, scan code for secrets, or assess infrastructure misconfigurations. What they don’t have is visibility into what’s actually happening right now, in the workloads already running in their environment. That’s the gap Aqua is closing with the launch of the Container Security Risk Assessment (CSRA). Security tooling has largely focused on pre-production controls like image scanning, CI/CD pipeline checks, and IaC validation. It is logical, and even easier than runtime. But once containers are running, things change. Configurations drift.</description></item><item><title>Kubernetes Multicontainer Pods: An Overview</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-04-22-kubernetes-multicontainer-pods-an-overview/</link><pubDate>Tue, 22 Apr 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-04-22-kubernetes-multicontainer-pods-an-overview/</guid><description>As cloud-native architectures continue to evolve, Kubernetes has become the go-to platform for deploying complex, distributed systems. One of the most powerful yet nuanced design patterns in this ecosystem is the sidecar pattern—a technique that allows developers to extend application functionality without diving deep into source code. Think of a sidecar like a trusty companion motorcycle attachment. Historically, IT infrastructures have always used auxiliary services to handle critical tasks. Before containers, we relied on background processes and helper daemons to manage logging, monitoring, and networking. The microservices revolution transformed this approach, making sidecars a structured and intentional architectural choice. With the rise of microservices, the sidecar pattern became more clearly defined, allowing developers to offload specific responsibilities from the main service without altering its code. Service meshes like Istio and Linkerd have popularized sidecar proxies, demonstrating how these companion containers can elegantly handle observability, security, and traffic management in distributed systems. In Kubernetes, sidecar containers operate within the same Pod as the main application, enabling communication and resource sharing. Does this sound just like defining multiple containers along each other inside the Pod? It actually does, and this is how sidecar containers had to be implemented before Kubernetes v1. 29. 0, which introduced native support for sidecars.</description></item><item><title>New concepts pages for hybrid networking</title><link>https://kubermates.org/releases/2025-04-18-new-concepts-pages-for-hybrid-networking/</link><pubDate>Fri, 18 Apr 2025 19:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/releases/2025-04-18-new-concepts-pages-for-hybrid-networking/</guid><description>Help improve this page To contribute to this user guide, choose the Edit this page on GitHub link that is located in the right pane of every page.

While this simplifies application deployment, it introduces significant security risks. Unrestricted network traffic allows workloads to interact with unauthorized destinations, increasing the potential for cyberattacks such as Remote Code Execution (RCE), DNS spoofing, and privilege escalation. To better understand these problems, let’s examine a sample Kubernetes application: ANP Demo App. This application comprises a deployment that spawns pods and a service that exposes them to external users in a similar situation like any real word workload which you will encounter in your environment. If you open the application service before implementing any policies, the application reports the following messages: In this blog post we are going through a scenario to secure our cluster by preventing our workloads from accessing the external resources. Number 1 and 3 from the previous list. In Kubernetes, the default permissive networking model, where all pods can freely communicate, poses a significant security challenge. While network policies are crucial for enforcing a Zero Trust security model, identifying the necessary network flows for an application to function correctly can be difficult. Using CLI tools to inspect network traffic and deduce the required policies can be a complex and time-consuming task. It often involves sifting through large amounts of data and requires a deep understanding of network protocols and Kubernetes internals. Even for experienced administrators, accurately capturing all necessary flows without disrupting application functionality is a challenge.</description></item><item><title>What's New on the GenAI Platform</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-04-14-what-s-new-on-the-genai-platform/</link><pubDate>Mon, 14 Apr 2025 19:02:28 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-04-14-what-s-new-on-the-genai-platform/</guid><description>By Grace Morgan DigitalOceanâs GenAI Platform is now DigitalOcean Gradient Platform.

An AWS managed policy is a standalone policy that is created and administered by AWS. AWS managed policies are designed to provide permissions for many common use cases so that you can start assigning permissions to users, groups, and roles. Keep in mind that AWS managed policies might not grant least-privilege permissions for your specific use cases because theyâre available for all AWS customers to use. We recommend that you reduce permissions further by defining customer managed policies that are specific to your use cases. You cannot change the permissions defined in AWS managed policies. If AWS updates the permissions defined in an AWS managed policy, the update affects all principal identities (users, groups, and roles) that the policy is attached to. AWS is most likely to update an AWS managed policy when a new AWS service is launched or new API operations become available for existing services. For more information, see AWS managed policies in the IAM User Guide. You can attach the AmazonEKS_CNI_Policy to your IAM entities. Before you create an Amazon EC2 node group, this policy must be attached to either the node IAM role , or to an IAM role thatâs used specifically by the Amazon VPC CNI plugin for Kubernetes.

This milestone opens the door for U. S. federal agencies, commercial organizations that require FedRAMP High, and cloud service providers operating in FedRAMP-authorized environments to confidently use Aqua’s platform for securing their cloud native applications. We met more than 400 rigorous security controls, giving federal agencies and commercial organizations the peace of mind that they can adopt cloud native technologies while meeting the highest security standards. FedRAMP (Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program) is a United States government-wide program that standardizes security assessments for cloud products and services. FedRAMP High is the most stringent level, designed for cloud services that manage highly sensitive data related to national security, public health, and other sensitive government functions. Achieving this level of authorization involves an extensive review of security controls, practices, and monitoring processes. The result: confidence that the platform is built to withstand today’s complex cyber threats. However, FedRAMP isn’t just about security; it also plays a critical role in compliance. It helps agencies meet a wide range of federal mandates and executive directives, such as NIST 800-53 standards, Executive Order 14028 on improving the nation’s cybersecurity, and OMB memoranda like M-22-09. By aligning cloud solutions with these policies, FedRAMP High Authorization ensures that agencies not only deploy secure technology but also do so in a manner consistent with federal oversight and accountability frameworks.</description></item><item><title>Introducing kube-scheduler-simulator</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-04-07-introducing-kube-scheduler-simulator/</link><pubDate>Mon, 07 Apr 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-04-07-introducing-kube-scheduler-simulator/</guid><description>The Kubernetes Scheduler is a crucial control plane component that determines which node a Pod will run on. Thus, anyone utilizing Kubernetes relies on a scheduler. kube-scheduler-simulator is a simulator for the Kubernetes scheduler, that started as a Google Summer of Code 2021 project developed by me (Kensei Nakada) and later received a lot of contributions. This tool allows users to closely examine the scheduler’s behavior and decisions. It is useful for casual users who employ scheduling constraints (for example, inter-Pod affinity ) and experts who extend the scheduler with custom plugins. The scheduler often appears as a black box, composed of many plugins that each contribute to the scheduling decision-making process from their unique perspectives. Understanding its behavior can be challenging due to the multitude of factors it considers. Even if a Pod appears to be scheduled correctly in a simple test cluster, it might have been scheduled based on different calculations than expected. This discrepancy could lead to unexpected scheduling outcomes when deployed in a large production environment. Also, testing a scheduler is a complex challenge. There are countless patterns of operations executed within a real cluster, making it unfeasible to anticipate every scenario with a finite number of tests. More often than not, bugs are discovered only when the scheduler is deployed in an actual cluster.</description></item><item><title>The Linux Foundation Announces Schedule for Open Source Summit North America 2025</title><link>https://kubermates.org/events/2025-04-03-the-linux-foundation-announces-schedule-for-open-source-summit-north-america-202/</link><pubDate>Thu, 03 Apr 2025 14:29:50 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/events/2025-04-03-the-linux-foundation-announces-schedule-for-open-source-summit-north-america-202/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Kicking off in Denver this year, one of the largest open source events in North America will bring …&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Sharks of DigitalOcean: Makeissah Robinson, Senior Director, Customer Support</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-04-03-sharks-of-digitalocean-makeissah-robinson-senior-director-customer-support/</link><pubDate>Thu, 03 Apr 2025 04:15:54 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-04-03-sharks-of-digitalocean-makeissah-robinson-senior-director-customer-support/</guid><description>By Sujatha R Technical Writer At DigitalOcean, customers are at the heart of what we do, and Makeissah Robinson, our Senior Director of Customer Support, embodies this commitment.

However, connecting different cloud environments securely and efficiently is a major headache. Many businesses struggle with unpredictable latency and complex VPN setups to keep their distributed workloads running smoothly. Without a seamless solution, managing cloud connectivity becomes a costly and time-consuming burden. At DigitalOcean, weâre committed to helping to eliminate these challenges by making cloud networking simpler, more scalable, and more accessible. Today, weâre excited to introduce the general availability of DigitalOcean Partner Network Connect, a cross-cloud connectivity solution that enables more secure, high-performance networking between DigitalOcean and other cloud providers or on-premise data centers. With Partner Network Connect, growing businesses can establish direct, private connections between DigitalOcean and other cloud providers or on-premise data centers or co-location facilitiesâbypassing the public internet to help improve security, minimize latency, and increase network performance. By integrating with Megaport, a leading Network-as-a-Service (NaaS) provider, weâre helping our customers connect their distributed workloads across multiple clouds easily, reliably, and affordably. As businesses scale, they often deploy workloads across multiple cloud providers or maintain hybrid cloud environments. Until now, cloud customers had to rely on VPNs or self-managed solutions to connect these environments, which can be complex to set up, costly, and difficult to maintain. DigitalOcean Partner Network Connect helps eliminate these challenges for cloud-to-cloud and on-premise connectivity. Key benefits include: Improved latency: Low latency, high-bandwidth private connectivity (1 Gbps to 10 Gbps) for faster, more reliable performance across cloud and on-premise environments.</description></item><item><title>Tomcat in the Crosshairs: New Research Reveals Ongoing Attacks</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-04-02-tomcat-in-the-crosshairs-new-research-reveals-ongoing-attacks/</link><pubDate>Wed, 02 Apr 2025 12:00:49 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-04-02-tomcat-in-the-crosshairs-new-research-reveals-ongoing-attacks/</guid><description>News headlines reported that it took just 30 hours for attackers to exploit a newly discovered vulnerability in Apache Tomcat servers. But what does this mean for workloads relying on Tomcat? Aqua Nautilus researchers discovered a new attack campaign targeting Apache Tomcat. In this blog, we shed light on newly discovered malware that targets Tomcat servers to hijack resources. After gaining initial access, the attackers uploads encrypted and encoded payloads that establish backdoors and persistence mechanisms. They then deploy two binaries disguised as kernel processes to exploit the server. The attack infrastructure appears to be relatively new, and code snippets suggest possible links to a Chinese-speaking threat actor. In this blog, we break down how the attack works—and how to stop it. The campaign targets Apache Tomcat servers and deploys encrypted payloads designed to run on both Windows and Linux systems. Once executed, the attack disguises itself, steals SSH credentials to spread laterally, and ultimately hijacks resources for cryptocurrency mining. It all starts with a brute-force attempt from a remote server using a Python script, which tests commonly used usernames and weak passwords on the Tomcat management console (e. g. , username “Tomcat” and password “123456”).</description></item><item><title>Introducing AMD Instinct MI300X GPUs to the DigitalOcean Bare Metal fleet</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-04-01-introducing-amd-instinct-mi300x-gpus-to-the-digitalocean-bare-metal-fleet/</link><pubDate>Tue, 01 Apr 2025 21:42:26 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-04-01-introducing-amd-instinct-mi300x-gpus-to-the-digitalocean-bare-metal-fleet/</guid><description>By Waverly Swinton Bare Metal GPUs are now DigitalOcean GradientAI Bare Metal GPUs.

However, as applications grow, so do their infrastructure and scaling requirements. Managing multiple clusters to handle large-scale workloads introduces operational complexity, increased network management, and challenges for the DevOps teams. These challenges can include greater resource fragmentation, increased latency due to inter-cluster communication, and the manual burden of maintaining security and compliance across multiple clusters. These challenges are particularly pronounced for data-intensive workloads like video streaming, large-scale data analytics, and security operations. Thatâs why weâre excited to announce a major evolution of DigitalOcean Kubernetes Service (DOKS), which consists of four features: Increased cluster capacity to 1,000 worker nodes per cluster Optimized networking with VPC-native Kubernetes Improved performance with eBPF-powered networking Managed Cilium for high-performance networking These updates help to empower businesses to run larger workloads within a single DOKS cluster, reducing the need for complex multi-cluster management and unlocking new levels of performance, reliability, and simplicity. NoBid, a Kubernetes customer who joined us at Deploy 2025, has seen significant improvements in scalability and security when deploying DOKS. âDigitalOcean Kubernetes provides NoBid with a powerful platform for our containerized workloads,&amp;quot; said Shawn Petersen, CIO at NoBid. âAdditionally, the ability to rapidly scale based on business demand, handle 1. 3 PB/month in data egress, along with better security controls were all key differentiators for us to partner with DigitalOcean. &amp;quot; If you want to learn more about NoBidâs use case, check out their case study.

This topic provides an overview of the available options and describes what to consider when you add, change, or remove the hybrid nodes configuration for an Amazon EKS cluster. To enable an Amazon EKS cluster to use hybrid nodes, add the IP address CIDR ranges of your on-premises node and optionally pod network in the RemoteNetworkConfig configuration. EKS uses this list of CIDRs to enable connectivity between the cluster and your on-premises networks. For a full list of options when updating your cluster configuration, see the UpdateClusterConfig in the Amazon EKS API Reference. You can do any of the following actions to the EKS Hybrid Nodes networking configuration in a cluster: Add remote network configuration to enable EKS Hybrid Nodes in an existing cluster. Add, change, or remove the remote node networks or the remote pod networks in an existing cluster. Remove all remote node network CIDR ranges to disable EKS Hybrid Nodes in an existing cluster. Before enabling your Amazon EKS cluster for hybrid nodes, ensure your environment meets the requirements outlined at Prerequisite setup for hybrid nodes , and detailed at Prepare networking for hybrid nodes , Prepare operating system for hybrid nodes , and Prepare credentials for hybrid nodes. Your cluster must use IPv4 address family. Your cluster must use either API or API_AND_CONFIG_MAP for the cluster authentication mode. The process for modifying the cluster authentication mode is described at Change authentication mode to use access entries.</description></item><item><title>Node health for EKS Hybrid Nodes</title><link>https://kubermates.org/releases/2025-03-31-node-health-for-eks-hybrid-nodes/</link><pubDate>Mon, 31 Mar 2025 19:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/releases/2025-03-31-node-health-for-eks-hybrid-nodes/</guid><description>Help improve this page To contribute to this user guide, choose the Edit this page on GitHub link that is located in the right pane of every page. Node health refers to the operational status and capability of a node to effectively run workloads. A healthy node maintains expected connectivity, has sufficient resources, and can successfully run Pods without disruption. For information on getting details about your nodes, see View the health status of your nodes and Retrieve node logs for a managed node using kubectl and S3. To help with maintaining healthy nodes, Amazon EKS offers the node monitoring agent and node auto repair. The node monitoring agent and node auto repair are only available on Linux. These features arenât available on Windows. The node monitoring agent automatically reads node logs to detect certain health issues. It parses through node logs to detect failures and surfaces various status information about worker nodes. A dedicated NodeCondition is applied on the worker nodes for each category of issues detected, such as storage and networking issues. Descriptions of detected health issues are made available in the observability dashboard.

When a new Kubernetes version is available in Amazon EKS, you can update your Amazon EKS cluster to the latest version. Once you upgrade a cluster, you canât downgrade to a previous version. Before you update to a new Kubernetes version, we recommend that you review the information in Understand the Kubernetes version lifecycle on EKS and the update steps in this topic. New Kubernetes versions sometimes introduce significant changes. Therefore, we recommend that you test the behavior of your applications against a new Kubernetes version before you update your production clusters. You can do this by building a continuous integration workflow to test your application behavior before moving to a new Kubernetes version. The update process consists of Amazon EKS launching new API server nodes with the updated Kubernetes version to replace the existing ones. Amazon EKS performs standard infrastructure and readiness health checks for network traffic on these new nodes to verify that theyâre working as expected. However, once youâve started the cluster upgrade, you canât pause or stop it. If any of these checks fail, Amazon EKS reverts the infrastructure deployment, and your cluster remains on the prior Kubernetes version. Running applications arenât affected, and your cluster is never left in a non-deterministic or unrecoverable state.</description></item><item><title>Bottlerocket FIPS AMIs</title><link>https://kubermates.org/releases/2025-03-27-bottlerocket-fips-amis/</link><pubDate>Thu, 27 Mar 2025 19:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/releases/2025-03-27-bottlerocket-fips-amis/</guid><description>Help improve this page To contribute to this user guide, choose the Edit this page on GitHub link that is located in the right pane of every page.

Security incidents rarely happen because of a single weak point. Instead, they stem from toxic combinations. A misconfigured workload might seem harmless on its own, but add exposed credentials and an unpatched vulnerability, and attackers have a direct path to exploitation. Traditional vulnerability scanners surface thousands of issues, yet many tools treat vulnerabilities, misconfigurations, malware, and exposed credentials as isolated problems rather than recognizing how they can combine to create real attack scenarios Without understanding the full attack surface and how risks interact, security teams end up chasing alerts instead of preventing breaches. Instead of drowning in alerts, you need context, a way to connect security findings across the entire cloud native application lifecycle. Aqua provides that visibility, correlating risks from the first line of code to runtime so security teams can focus on what is actually exploitable, not just what is flagged. But risk prioritization is not just about what exists, it is about what an attacker can actually access and exploit. A vulnerability might seem critical, but is it isolated in a test environment, restricted within an internal network, or exposed in a production system accessible from the internet? For example, a banking application with an unpatched critical vulnerability might seem like an urgent issue, but if it is running in a segmented test environment, the risk is far lower than if the same vulnerability exists in a publicly accessible production system. Aqua assesses network exposure, identifying whether a CVE is just a theoretical risk or if it is publicly accessible and exploitable. By linking misconfigurations, exposed credentials, and network exposure with known vulnerabilities, Aqua surfaces toxic combinations that create real world attack paths. Aqua also connects these risks across hybrid and multi-cloud environments, ensuring teams have a comprehensive view of their attack surface, no matter where workloads are running.</description></item><item><title>Kubernetes v1.33 sneak peek</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-03-26-kubernetes-v1-33-sneak-peek/</link><pubDate>Wed, 26 Mar 2025 10:30:00 -0800</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-03-26-kubernetes-v1-33-sneak-peek/</guid><description>As the release of Kubernetes v1. 33 approaches, the Kubernetes project continues to evolve. Features may be deprecated, removed, or replaced to improve the overall health of the project. This blog post outlines some planned changes for the v1. 33 release, which the release team believes you should be aware of to ensure the continued smooth operation of your Kubernetes environment and to keep you up-to-date with the latest developments. The information below is based on the current status of the v1. 33 release and is subject to change before the final release date. The Kubernetes project has a well-documented deprecation policy for features. This policy states that stable APIs may only be deprecated when a newer, stable version of that same API is available and that APIs have a minimum lifetime for each stability level. A deprecated API has been marked for removal in a future Kubernetes release. It will continue to function until removal (at least one year from the deprecation), but usage will result in a warning being displayed. Removed APIs are no longer available in the current version, at which point you must migrate to using the replacement.</description></item><item><title>IngressNightmare Vulnerabilities: All You Need to Know</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-03-26-ingressnightmare-vulnerabilities-all-you-need-to-know/</link><pubDate>Wed, 26 Mar 2025 13:15:57 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-03-26-ingressnightmare-vulnerabilities-all-you-need-to-know/</guid><description>CVE-2025-1974 * CVE-2025-24514 * CVE-2025-1097 * CVE-2025-1098 * CVE-2025-24513 On March 24, 2025, a set of critical vulnerabilities (CVE-2025-1097, CVE-2025-1098, CVE-2025-24514, and CVE-2025-1974 — collectively referred to as IngressNightmare was disclosed in the ingress-nginx Controller for Kubernetes. These vulnerabilities could lead to a complete cluster takeover by granting attackers unauthorized access to all secrets stored across all namespaces in the Kubernetes cluster. In Kubernetes, an Ingress Controller manages external access to services within a cluster, typically via HTTP or HTTPS. The ingress NGINX Controller, built on the NGINX web server , is widely used to route incoming traffic to the appropriate backend services based on defined rules. The disclosed vulnerabilities include: CVE-2025-1974 (CVSS Score 9. 8 Critical) Allows unauthenticated attackers with pod network access to execute arbitrary code in the ingress-nginx controller, potentially leading to full cluster takeover. CVE-2025-24514, CVE-2025-1097, CVE-2025-1098 (CVSS Score 8. 8 High) Involve improper handling of Ingress annotations that can lead to code execution or unauthorized data access. CVE-2025-24513 (CVSS Score 4. 8 Medium) Involves directory traversal that can lead to DoS or limited secret disclosure. The researchers who found these vulnerabilities indicated that over 40% of cloud environments were vulnerable to these remote code execution (RCE) risks. Their analysis discovered over 6,500 clusters, including those of Fortune 500 companies, that publicly expose the admission controllers of vulnerable Kubernetes ingress controllers to the public internet, placing them at immediate critical risk.</description></item><item><title>Kubeflow 1.10 Release Announcement</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-03-26-kubeflow-1-10-release-announcement/</link><pubDate>Wed, 26 Mar 2025 00:00:00 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-03-26-kubeflow-1-10-release-announcement/</guid><description>Mar 26, 2025 • Kubeflow 1. 10 Release Team, Dimitris Poulopoulos • 8 min read release Kubeflow 1. 10. 0 delivers essential updates that enhance the flexibility, efficiency, and scalability of machine learning workflows.

It offers numerous benefits, such as effectively increasing a node’s memory by swapping out unused data, shielding nodes from system-level memory spikes, preventing Pods from crashing when they hit their memory limits, and much more. As a result, the node special interest group within the Kubernetes project has invested significant effort into supporting swap on Linux nodes. The 1. 22 release introduced Alpha support for configuring swap memory usage for Kubernetes workloads running on Linux on a per-node basis. Later, in release 1. 28, support for swap on Linux nodes has graduated to Beta, along with many new improvements. In the following Kubernetes releases more improvements were made, paving the way to GA in the near future. Prior to version 1. 22, Kubernetes did not provide support for swap memory on Linux systems. This was due to the inherent difficulty in guaranteeing and accounting for pod memory utilization when swap memory was involved. As a result, swap support was deemed out of scope in the initial design of Kubernetes, and the default behavior of a kubelet was to fail to start if swap memory was detected on a node.</description></item><item><title>Ingress-nginx CVE-2025-1974: What You Need to Know</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-03-24-ingress-nginx-cve-2025-1974-what-you-need-to-know/</link><pubDate>Mon, 24 Mar 2025 12:00:00 -0800</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-03-24-ingress-nginx-cve-2025-1974-what-you-need-to-know/</guid><description>Today, the ingress-nginx maintainers have released patches for a batch of critical vulnerabilities that could make it easy for attackers to take over your Kubernetes cluster: ingress-nginx v1. 12. 1 and ingress-nginx v1. 11. 5. If you are among the over 40% of Kubernetes administrators using ingress-nginx , you should take action immediately to protect your users and data. Ingress is the traditional Kubernetes feature for exposing your workload Pods to the world so that they can be useful. In an implementation-agnostic way, Kubernetes users can define how their applications should be made available on the network. Then, an ingress controller uses that definition to set up local or cloud resources as required for the user’s particular situation and needs. Many different ingress controllers are available, to suit users of different cloud providers or brands of load balancers. Ingress-nginx is a software-only ingress controller provided by the Kubernetes project. Because of its versatility and ease of use, ingress-nginx is quite popular: it is deployed in over 40% of Kubernetes clusters! Ingress-nginx translates the requirements from Ingress objects into configuration for nginx, a powerful open source webserver daemon.</description></item><item><title>How the Google-Wiz acquisition redefines cloud security</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-03-24-how-the-google-wiz-acquisition-redefines-cloud-security/</link><pubDate>Mon, 24 Mar 2025 16:36:45 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-03-24-how-the-google-wiz-acquisition-redefines-cloud-security/</guid><description>Google’s acquisition of Wiz, announced last week, is a pivotal moment as it marks a strategic shift in how cyber security will evolve over the next few years. It instantly turns Google into a major player in security, adding Wiz to other building blocks Google has racked up in the past couple of years, most notably Mandiant and Google Chronicle. Google will be a new gorilla in the security market, just as Microsoft created a thriving, multi-billion dollar business out of the Defender product line. But while Microsoft has a long history of “owning” operating systems, servers, and Office applications, and is leveraging that to expand its footprint, Google is new to the enterprise security business. In the first phase of public cloud adoption, the “lift and shift” phase, CSPM (cloud security posture management) emerged to ensure proper configuration of cloud services, and CWPP (cloud workload protection platforms) to monitor and protect workloads running in the cloud. The second phase of cloud adoption, the cloud native phase, driven by technologies such as containers, serverless functions, CI/CD, and orchestration (Kubernetes), imparted an even more dramatic change in security – the integration of multiple silos of application related security information. It introduced integrated shift left capabilities , providing a broader risk-based approach to vulnerability management, hardening, and incident management. Thus CNAPP (cloud native application protection platforms) was born. In the early days of cloud services, the cloud providers adopted the shared responsibility model in which some responsibilities were borne by them (such as infrastructure and physical security), others were clearly on the shoulders of customers (configuring of services, their data, their users, their applications), and there’s been a non-negligible area of “shared responsibility” where the answer is often “it depends”. I believe that with this move, Google is shifting the borders within this model and will be offering more of the posture management and visibility to customers as part of its infrastructure. After all this is what Wiz has become famous for – agentless scanning of the cloud estate, providing broad visibility and risk assessment. And this is something a cloud provider can easily integrate into cloud operations.</description></item><item><title>Introducing JobSet</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-03-23-introducing-jobset/</link><pubDate>Sun, 23 Mar 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-03-23-introducing-jobset/</guid><description>Authors : Daniel Vega-Myhre (Google), Abdullah Gharaibeh (Google), Kevin Hannon (Red Hat) In this article, we introduce JobSet , an open source API for representing distributed jobs. The goal of JobSet is to provide a unified API for distributed ML training and HPC workloads on Kubernetes. The Kubernetes community’s recent enhancements to the batch ecosystem on Kubernetes has attracted ML engineers who have found it to be a natural fit for the requirements of running distributed training workloads. Large ML models (particularly LLMs) which cannot fit into the memory of the GPU or TPU chips on a single host are often distributed across tens of thousands of accelerator chips, which in turn may span thousands of hosts. As such, the model training code is often containerized and executed simultaneously on all these hosts, performing distributed computations which often shard both the model parameters and/or the training dataset across the target accelerator chips, using communication collective primitives like all-gather and all-reduce to perform distributed computations and synchronize gradients between hosts. These workload characteristics make Kubernetes a great fit for this type of workload, as efficiently scheduling and managing the lifecycle of containerized applications across a cluster of compute resources is an area where it shines. It is also very extensible, allowing developers to define their own Kubernetes APIs, objects, and controllers which manage the behavior and life cycle of these objects, allowing engineers to develop custom distributed training orchestration solutions to fit their needs. However, as distributed ML training techniques continue to evolve, existing Kubernetes primitives do not adequately model them alone anymore. Furthermore, the landscape of Kubernetes distributed training orchestration APIs has become fragmented, and each of the existing solutions in this fragmented landscape has certain limitations that make it non-optimal for distributed ML training. For example, the KubeFlow training operator defines custom APIs for different frameworks (e. g. PyTorchJob, TFJob, MPIJob, etc.</description></item><item><title>Powering AI Innovation: DigitalOcean Bare Metal GPUs in EU Data Center</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-03-20-powering-ai-innovation-digitalocean-bare-metal-gpus-in-eu-data-center/</link><pubDate>Thu, 20 Mar 2025 14:59:45 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-03-20-powering-ai-innovation-digitalocean-bare-metal-gpus-in-eu-data-center/</guid><description>By DigitalOcean Bare Metal GPUs are now DigitalOcean GradientAI Bare Metal GPUs.

This vulnerability allows remote attackers to expose CI/CD secrets via the action’s build logs. The issue affects users who rely on the tj-actions/changed-files action in GitHub workflows to track changed files within a pull request. Due to the compromised action, sensitive CI/CD secrets are being inadvertently logged in the GitHub Actions build logs. If these logs are publicly accessible, such as in public repositories, unauthorized users could access and retrieve the clear text secrets. However, there is no evidence suggesting that the exposed secrets were transmitted to any external network. The tj-actions/changed-files action is widely used in GitHub CI/CD workflows to efficiently detect file changes within pull requests, streamlining development processes by conditionally triggering actions based on modified files. With over 23,000 active repositories and more than 1 million monthly downloads, its widespread adoption makes this compromise particularly impactful, exposing numerous organizations to potential supply chain attacks. According to the initial report by StepSecurity this incident was first discovered at 4PM UTC on March 14th, 2025, and isolated by 10:30 AM UTC on March 15th, 2025. But, we still warmly advise to avoid using this action until this matter is fully resolved. Initial investigation implies on a malicious commit ( hash:0e58ed8671d6b60d0890c21b07f8835ace038e67 ), and a retroactive compromise of multiple versions, possibly all versions. The attackers introduced malicious JavaScript code directly into the dist/index.</description></item><item><title>🚀 Announcing the Kubeflow Spark Operator Benchmarking Results</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-03-15-announcing-the-kubeflow-spark-operator-benchmarking-results/</link><pubDate>Sat, 15 Mar 2025 00:00:00 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-03-15-announcing-the-kubeflow-spark-operator-benchmarking-results/</guid><description>Mar 15, 2025 • Vara Bonthu , Manabu McCloskey , Ratnopam Chakrabarti , Alan Halcyon • 5 min read operators benchmarking performance Kubernetes has become the go-to platform for running large-scale Apache Spark workloads. But as workloads scale, how do you ensure your Spark jobs run efficiently without hitting bottlenecks? Managing thousands of concurrent Spark jobs can introduce severe performance challenges —from CPU saturation in the Spark Operator to Kubernetes API slowdowns and job scheduling inefficiencies. To address these challenges, we are excited to introduce the Kubeflow Spark Operator Benchmarking Results and Toolkit —a comprehensive framework to analyze performance, pinpoint bottlenecks, and optimize your Spark on Kubernetes deployments. This benchmarking effort provides three key outcomes to help you take full control of your Spark on Kubernetes deployment: ✅ Benchmarking Results – A detailed evaluation of performance insights and tuning recommendations for large-scale Spark workloads. 🛠 Benchmarking Test Toolkit – A fully reproducible test suite to help users evaluate their own Spark Operator performance and validate improvements. 📊 Open-Sourced Grafana Dashboard – A battle-tested visualization tool designed specifically to track large-scale Spark Operator deployments, providing real-time monitoring of job processing efficiency, API latencies, and system health. Running thousands of Spark jobs on Kubernetes at scale uncovers several performance roadblocks that can cripple efficiency if left unresolved: 💡 So, how do you fix these issues and optimize your Spark Operator deployment? That’s where our benchmarking results and toolkit come in. Based on our benchmarking findings, we provide clear, actionable recommendations for improving Spark Operator performance at scale. If you’re running thousands of concurrent Spark jobs , here’s what you need to do: 💡 Why? A single Spark Operator instance struggles to keep up with high job submission rates. ✅ Solution : When a single Spark Operator instance struggles with high job submission rates, leading to CPU saturation and slower job launches, deploying multiple instances can help. Distribute the workload by assigning different namespaces to each instance. For example, one instance can manage ` 20 namespaces while another handles a separate set of 20 namespaces.</description></item><item><title>DigitalOcean Managed MongoDB now supports MongoDB 8.0</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-03-13-digitalocean-managed-mongodb-now-supports-mongodb-8-0/</link><pubDate>Thu, 13 Mar 2025 17:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-03-13-digitalocean-managed-mongodb-now-supports-mongodb-8-0/</guid><description>By Nicole Ghalwash MongoDB 8. 0 is here, bringing significant performance, scalability, and security enhancements to DigitalOcean Managed MongoDB.

The attack consists of multiple stages, beginning with the download of a compressed file from a remote server. Once executed, the attacker deploys several malicious tools to exploit the server and establish persistence. This campaign poses a significant risk to cloud-native environments, as it enables unauthorized access and long-term control over compromised systems. In this blog, we will outline the attack stages, discuss the potential risks, and provide recommendations to strengthen security and prevent exploitation. Interactive Computing Environments or Notebook Interfaces are platforms designed for data scientists and programmers to write, execute, and analyze code interactively. There are many products available, including Jupyter Notebook , JupyterLab , Apache Zeppelin , Google Colab , Databricks Notebooks , and others. These environments are often connected to the internet and require authentication to access data or execute code. However, a simple misconfiguration can sometimes expose the server to malicious activity by hackers. Figure 1: Sobolan campaign attack flow The attackers gained initial access through an unauthenticated JupyterLab instance, allowing them to deploy malware and cryptominers. They first downloaded and extracted a compressed archive containing 13 malicious files, consisting of both binaries and shell scripts. Once executed, these scripts initiated multiple processes to establish persistence, hijack system resources for cryptomining, and evade detection (as shown in Figure 1).</description></item><item><title>Introducing a Managed Component for Maintaining Host Routes in Kubernetes</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-03-10-introducing-a-managed-component-for-maintaining-host-routes-in-kubernetes/</link><pubDate>Mon, 10 Mar 2025 19:39:28 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-03-10-introducing-a-managed-component-for-maintaining-host-routes-in-kubernetes/</guid><description>By Marco Jantke Our new DOKS routing agent is a managed component for configuring static routes on Kubernetes worker nodes. It is a direct response to user feedback on its predecessor, the static route operator, and introduces new features to enhance routing flexibility. Despite being a managed component, the DOKS routing agent is included at no additional cost for users. The DOKS routing agent enables users to configure IP routes on their Kubernetes worker nodes using a dedicated Kubernetes Custom Resource. This is particularly useful for VPN setups or tunneling egress traffic through specific gateway nodes. The routing agent supports multiple gateways and automatically configures ECMP (Equal-Cost Multi-Path) routing to distribute traffic across them. How ECMP Works: The routing agent allows users to override default routes without disrupting cluster connectivityâone of the most requested features. To prevent issues with Kubernetes components, the routing agent ensures that essential control plane endpoints, metadata services, and DNS servers maintain direct connectivity through the worker node Dropletâs default gateway. Routes can be applied to specific nodes using Kubernetes label selectors, allowing for fine-grained control over network configurations. The routing agent can be enabled or disabled using doctl or the DigitalOcean API. For API users, the field structure is: With the DOKS routing agent and a self-managed VPC gateway Droplet, users can configure static egress IPs, ensuring outbound traffic from Kubernetes workloads originates from a predictable IP address. Weâre also working on a fully managed NAT gateway , which will offer a simpler solution for achieving static egress IPs.</description></item><item><title>Blog: Spotlight on SIG etcd</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-03-04-blog-spotlight-on-sig-etcd/</link><pubDate>Tue, 04 Mar 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-03-04-blog-spotlight-on-sig-etcd/</guid><description>In this SIG etcd spotlight we talked with James Blair , Marek Siarkowicz , Wenjia Zhang , and Benjamin Wang to learn a bit more about this Kubernetes Special Interest Group.

Currently in beta, it is expected to be GA as of 1. 33. The new mode fixes long-standing performance problems with the iptables mode and all users running on systems with reasonably-recent kernels are encouraged to try it out. (For compatibility reasons, even once nftables becomes GA, iptables will still be the default. ) The iptables API was designed for implementing simple firewalls, and has problems scaling up to support Service proxying in a large Kubernetes cluster with tens of thousands of Services. In general, the ruleset generated by kube-proxy in iptables mode has a number of iptables rules proportional to the sum of the number of Services and the total number of endpoints. In particular, at the top level of the ruleset, there is one rule to test each possible Service IP (and port) that a packet might be addressed to: This means that when a packet comes in, the time it takes the kernel to check it against all of the Service rules is O(n) in the number of Services. As the number of Services increases, both the average and the worst-case latency for the first packet of a new connection increases (with the difference between best-case, average, and worst-case being mostly determined by whether a given Service IP address appears earlier or later in the KUBE-SERVICES chain). By contrast, with nftables, the normal way to write a ruleset like this is to have a single rule, using a &amp;ldquo;verdict map&amp;rdquo; to do the dispatch: Since there&amp;rsquo;s only a single rule, with a roughly O(1) map lookup, packet processing time is more or less constant regardless of cluster size, and the best/average/worst cases are very similar: But note the huge difference in the vertical scale between the iptables and nftables graphs! In the clusters with 5000 and 10,000 Services, the p50 (average) latency for nftables is about the same as the p01 (approximately best-case) latency for iptables. In the 30,000 Service cluster, the p99 (approximately worst-case) latency for nftables manages to beat out the p01 latency for iptables by a few microseconds! Here&amp;rsquo;s both sets of data together, but you may have to squint to see the nftables results!: While the improvements to data plane latency in large clusters are great, there&amp;rsquo;s another problem with iptables kube-proxy that often keeps users from even being able to grow their clusters to that size: the time it takes kube-proxy to program new iptables rules when Services and their endpoints change.</description></item><item><title>🔐 Secure Secret Management with SOPS in Helm 🚀</title><link>https://kubermates.org/blog/secure-secret-management-with-sops-in-helm-1940/</link><pubDate>Thu, 27 Feb 2025 08:15:10 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/blog/secure-secret-management-with-sops-in-helm-1940/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;When managing applications deployed on Kubernetes, keeping secrets safe while still making them accessible to Helm charts is a challenge.

Feb 21, 2025 • Varsha Prasad Narsing (@varshaprasad96) • 7 min read katib As artificial intelligence and machine learning models become more sophisticated, optimising their performance remains a critical challenge. Kubeflow provides a robust component, Katib , designed for hyperparameter optimization and neural architecture search. As a part of the Kubeflow ecosystem, Katib enables scalable, automated tuning of underlying machine learning models, reducing the manual effort required for parameter selection while improving model performance across diverse ML workflows. With Retrieval-Augmented Generation ( RAG ) becoming an increasingly popular approach for improving search and retrieval quality, optimizing its parameters is essential to achieving high-quality results. RAG pipelines involve multiple hyperparameters that influence retrieval accuracy, hallucination reduction, and language generation quality. In this blog, we will explore how Katib can be leveraged to fine-tune a RAG pipeline, ensuring optimal performance by systematically adjusting key hyperparameters. Since compute resources are scarcer than a perfectly labeled dataset :), we’ll use a lightweight Kind cluster (Kubernetes in Docker) cluster to run this example locally. Rest assured, this setup can seamlessly scale to larger clusters by increasing the dataset size and the number of hyperparameters to tune. To get started, we’ll first install the Katib control plane in our cluster by following the steps outlined in the documentation. In this implementation, we use a retriever model , which encodes queries and documents into vector representations to find the most relevant matches, to fetch relevant documents based on a query and a generator model to produce coherent text responses. To run Katib, we will use the Katib SDK , which provides a programmatic interface for defining and running hyperparameter tuning experiments in Kubeflow.</description></item><item><title>Synthetic Data Generation with Kubeflow Pipelines</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-02-16-synthetic-data-generation-with-kubeflow-pipelines/</link><pubDate>Sun, 16 Feb 2025 00:00:00 -0600</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-02-16-synthetic-data-generation-with-kubeflow-pipelines/</guid><description>Feb 16, 2025 • Åke Edlund , Tarek Abouzeid • 11 min read kfp When creating insights, decisions, and actions from data, the best results come from real data. But accessing real data often requires lengthy security and legal processes. The data may also be incomplete, biased, or too small, and during early exploration, we may not even know if it’s worth pursuing. While real data is essential for proper evaluation, gaps or limited access frequently hinder progress until the formal process is complete. To address these challenges, synthetic data provides an alternative. It mimics real data’s statistical properties while preserving privacy and accessibility. Synthetic data generators (synthesizers) are models trained on real data to generate new datasets that follow the same statistical distributions and relationships but do not contain real records. This allows for accelerated development, improved data availability, and enhanced privacy. Depending on the technique used, synthetic data not only mirrors statistical base properties of real data but also preserves correlations between features. These synthesizers — such as those based on Gaussian Copulas, Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), and Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) — enable the creation of high-fidelity synthetic datasets. See more description of these techniques below. While the above focuses on speed of development in general, and augmentation of data to improve performance of analytical modes, there are more motivations for creating (synthetic) data: Enhanced Privacy and Security Mimics real datasets without containing sensitive or personally identifiable information, mitigating privacy risks and ensuring compliance with regulations like GDPR.</description></item><item><title>The Cloud Controller Manager Chicken and Egg Problem</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-02-14-the-cloud-controller-manager-chicken-and-egg-problem/</link><pubDate>Fri, 14 Feb 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-02-14-the-cloud-controller-manager-chicken-and-egg-problem/</guid><description>Kubernetes 1. 31 completed the largest migration in Kubernetes history , removing the in-tree cloud provider. While the component migration is now done, this leaves some additional complexity for users and installer projects (for example, kOps or Cluster API). We will go over those additional steps and failure points and make recommendations for cluster owners. This migration was complex and some logic had to be extracted from the core components, building four new subsystems. The cloud controller manager is part of the control plane. It is a critical component that replaces some functionality that existed previously in the kube-controller-manager and the kubelet. Components of Kubernetes One of the most critical functionalities of the cloud controller manager is the node controller, which is responsible for the initialization of the nodes. As you can see in the following diagram, when the kubelet starts, it registers the Node object with the apiserver, Tainting the node so it can be processed first by the cloud-controller-manager. The initial Node is missing the cloud-provider specific information, like the Node Addresses and the Labels with the cloud provider specific information like the Node, Region and Instance type information. Chicken and egg problem sequence diagram This new initialization process adds some latency to the node readiness. Previously, the kubelet was able to initialize the node at the same time it created the node.</description></item><item><title>Update strategies for managed node groups</title><link>https://kubermates.org/releases/2025-01-27-update-strategies-for-managed-node-groups/</link><pubDate>Mon, 27 Jan 2025 19:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/releases/2025-01-27-update-strategies-for-managed-node-groups/</guid><description>Help improve this page To contribute to this user guide, choose the Edit this page on GitHub link that is located in the right pane of every page. The Amazon EKS managed worker node upgrade strategy has four different phases described in the following sections. The setup phase has these steps: It creates a new Amazon EC2 launch template version for the Auto Scaling Group thatâs associated with your node group. The new launch template version uses the target AMI or a custom launch template version for the update. It updates the Auto Scaling Group to use the latest launch template version. It determines the maximum quantity of nodes to upgrade in parallel using the updateConfig property for the node group. The maximum unavailable has a quota of 100 nodes. The default value is one node. For more information, see the updateConfig property in the Amazon EKS API Reference. When upgrading the nodes in a managed node group, the upgraded nodes are launched in the same Availability Zone as those that are being upgraded. To guarantee this placement, we use Amazon EC2âs Availability Zone Rebalancing. For more information, see Availability Zone Rebalancing in the Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling User Guide.</description></item><item><title>Kubernetes version 1.32</title><link>https://kubermates.org/releases/2025-01-23-kubernetes-version-1-32/</link><pubDate>Thu, 23 Jan 2025 19:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/releases/2025-01-23-kubernetes-version-1-32/</guid><description>Help improve this page To contribute to this user guide, choose the Edit this page on GitHub link that is located in the right pane of every page. Kubernetes rapidly evolves with new features, design updates, and bug fixes. The community releases new Kubernetes minor versions (such as 1. 33 ) on average once every four months. Amazon EKS follows the upstream release and deprecation cycle for minor versions. As new Kubernetes versions become available in Amazon EKS, we recommend that you proactively update your clusters to use the latest available version. A minor version is under standard support in Amazon EKS for the first 14 months after itâs released. Once a version is past the end of standard support date, it enters extended support for the next 12 months. Extended support allows you to stay at a specific Kubernetes version for longer at an additional cost per cluster hour. If you havenât updated your cluster before the extended support period ends, your cluster is auto-upgraded to the oldest currently supported extended version. Extended support is enabled by default. To disable, see Disable EKS extended support.</description></item><item><title>Helm Chart Essentials &amp; Writing Effective Charts 🚀</title><link>https://kubermates.org/blog/helm-chart-essentials-writing-effective-charts-11ca/</link><pubDate>Thu, 23 Jan 2025 10:50:53 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/blog/helm-chart-essentials-writing-effective-charts-11ca/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Helm charts are a powerful way to define, install, and upgrade Kubernetes applications.

The recent release of Kubernetes v1. 32 moved that support to beta. The support for volume group snapshots relies on a set of extension APIs for group snapshots. These APIs allow users to take crash consistent snapshots for a set of volumes. Behind the scenes, Kubernetes uses a label selector to group multiple PersistentVolumeClaims for snapshotting. A key aim is to allow you restore that set of snapshots to new volumes and recover your workload based on a crash consistent recovery point. This new feature is only supported for CSI volume drivers. Some storage systems provide the ability to create a crash consistent snapshot of multiple volumes. A group snapshot represents copies made from multiple volumes, that are taken at the same point-in-time. A group snapshot can be used either to rehydrate new volumes (pre-populated with the snapshot data) or to restore existing volumes to a previous state (represented by the snapshots).</description></item><item><title>Enhancing Kubernetes API Server Efficiency with API Streaming</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2024-12-17-enhancing-kubernetes-api-server-efficiency-with-api-streaming/</link><pubDate>Tue, 17 Dec 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2024-12-17-enhancing-kubernetes-api-server-efficiency-with-api-streaming/</guid><description>Managing Kubernetes clusters efficiently is critical, especially as their size is growing. A significant challenge with large clusters is the memory overhead caused by list requests. In the existing implementation, the kube-apiserver processes list requests by assembling the entire response in-memory before transmitting any data to the client. But what if the response body is substantial, say hundreds of megabytes? Additionally, imagine a scenario where multiple list requests flood in simultaneously, perhaps after a brief network outage. While API Priority and Fairness has proven to reasonably protect kube-apiserver from CPU overload, its impact is visibly smaller for memory protection. This can be explained by the differing nature of resource consumption by a single API request - the CPU usage at any given time is capped by a constant, whereas memory, being uncompressible, can grow proportionally with the number of processed objects and is unbounded. This situation poses a genuine risk, potentially overwhelming and crashing any kube-apiserver within seconds due to out-of-memory (OOM) conditions. To better visualize the issue, let&amp;rsquo;s consider the below graph. The graph shows the memory usage of a kube-apiserver during a synthetic test. (see the synthetic test section for more details). The results clearly show that increasing the number of informers significantly boosts the server&amp;rsquo;s memory consumption. Notably, at approximately 16:40, the server crashed when serving only 16 informers.</description></item><item><title>Kubernetes v1.32 Adds A New CPU Manager Static Policy Option For Strict CPU Reservation</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2024-12-16-kubernetes-v1-32-adds-a-new-cpu-manager-static-policy-option-for-strict-cpu-rese/</link><pubDate>Mon, 16 Dec 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2024-12-16-kubernetes-v1-32-adds-a-new-cpu-manager-static-policy-option-for-strict-cpu-rese/</guid><description>In Kubernetes v1. 32, after years of community discussion, we are excited to introduce a strict-cpu-reservation option for the CPU Manager static policy. This feature is currently in alpha, with the associated policy hidden by default. You can only use the policy if you explicitly enable the alpha behavior in your cluster. The CPU Manager static policy is used to reduce latency or improve performance. The reservedSystemCPUs defines an explicit CPU set for OS system daemons and kubernetes system daemons. This option is designed for Telco/NFV type use cases where uncontrolled interrupts/timers may impact the workload performance. you can use this option to define the explicit cpuset for the system/kubernetes daemons as well as the interrupts/timers, so the rest CPUs on the system can be used exclusively for workloads, with less impact from uncontrolled interrupts/timers. More details of this parameter can be found on the Explicitly Reserved CPU List page. If you want to protect your system daemons and interrupt processing, the obvious way is to use the reservedSystemCPUs option. However, until the Kubernetes v1. 32 release, this isolation was only implemented for guaranteed pods that made requests for a whole number of CPUs.</description></item><item><title>Kubernetes v1.32: Memory Manager Goes GA</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2024-12-13-kubernetes-v1-32-memory-manager-goes-ga/</link><pubDate>Fri, 13 Dec 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2024-12-13-kubernetes-v1-32-memory-manager-goes-ga/</guid><description>With Kubernetes 1. 32, the memory manager has officially graduated to General Availability (GA), marking a significant milestone in the journey toward efficient and predictable memory allocation for containerized applications. Since Kubernetes v1. 22, where it graduated to beta, the memory manager has proved itself reliable, stable and a good complementary feature for the CPU Manager. As part of kubelet&amp;rsquo;s workload admission process, the memory manager provides topology hints to optimize memory allocation and alignment. This enables users to allocate exclusive memory for Pods in the Guaranteed QoS class. More details about the process can be found in the memory manager goes to beta blog. Most of the changes introduced since the Beta are bug fixes, internal refactoring and observability improvements, such as metrics and better logging. As part of the effort to increase the observability of memory manager, new metrics have been added to provide some statistics on memory allocation patterns. memory_manager_pinning_requests_total - tracks the number of times the pod spec required the memory manager to pin memory pages. memory_manager_pinning_errors_total - tracks the number of times the pod spec required the memory manager to pin memory pages, but the allocation failed.

In line with previous releases, the release of Kubernetes v1. 32 introduces new stable, beta, and alpha features. The consistent delivery of high-quality releases underscores the strength of our development cycle and the vibrant support from our community. This release consists of 44 enhancements in total. Of those enhancements, 13 have graduated to Stable, 12 are entering Beta, and 19 have entered in Alpha. The Kubernetes v1. 32 Release Theme is &amp;ldquo;Penelope&amp;rdquo;. If Kubernetes is Ancient Greek for &amp;ldquo;pilot&amp;rdquo;, in this release we start from that origin and reflect on the last 10 years of Kubernetes and our accomplishments: each release cycle is a journey, and just like Penelope, in &amp;ldquo;The Odyssey&amp;rdquo;, weaved for 10 years &amp;ndash; each night removing parts of what she had done during the day &amp;ndash; so does each release add new features and removes others, albeit here with a much clearer purpose of constantly improving Kubernetes. With v1. 32 being the last release in the year Kubernetes marks its first decade anniversary, we wanted to honour all of those that have been part of the global Kubernetes crew that roams the cloud-native seas through perils and challanges: may we continue to weave the future of Kubernetes together. In this release, like the previous one, the Kubernetes project continues proposing a number of enhancements to the Dynamic Resource Allocation (DRA), a key component of the Kubernetes resource management system.</description></item><item><title>Amazon EKS Auto Mode</title><link>https://kubermates.org/releases/2024-12-01-amazon-eks-auto-mode/</link><pubDate>Sun, 01 Dec 2024 19:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/releases/2024-12-01-amazon-eks-auto-mode/</guid><description>Help improve this page To contribute to this user guide, choose the Edit this page on GitHub link that is located in the right pane of every page.

This version of the API was released on October 3, and we&amp;rsquo;re delighted to report that we now have a number of conformant implementations of it for you to try out. Gateway API v1. 2 brings a number of new features to the Standard channel (Gateway API&amp;rsquo;s GA release channel), introduces some new experimental features, and inaugurates our new release process — but it also brings two breaking changes that you&amp;rsquo;ll want to be careful of. Now that the v1 versions of GRPCRoute and ReferenceGrant have graduated to Standard, the old v1alpha2 versions have been removed from both the Standard and Experimental channels, in order to ease the maintenance burden that perpetually supporting the old versions would place on the Gateway API community. Before upgrading to Gateway API v1. 2, you&amp;rsquo;ll want to confirm that any implementations of Gateway API have been upgraded to support the v1 API version of these resources instead of the v1alpha2 API version. Note that even if you&amp;rsquo;ve been using v1 in your YAML manifests, a controller may still be using v1alpha2 which would cause it to fail during this upgrade. Additionally, Kubernetes itself goes to some effort to stop you from removing a CRD version that it thinks you&amp;rsquo;re using: check out the release notes for more information about what you need to do to safely upgrade. A much smaller breaking change:. status. supportedFeatures in a Gateway is now a list of objects instead of a list of strings.</description></item><item><title>How we built a dynamic Kubernetes API Server for the API Aggregation Layer in Cozystack</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2024-11-21-how-we-built-a-dynamic-kubernetes-api-server-for-the-api-aggregation-layer-in-co/</link><pubDate>Thu, 21 Nov 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2024-11-21-how-we-built-a-dynamic-kubernetes-api-server-for-the-api-aggregation-layer-in-co/</guid><description>Hi there! I&amp;rsquo;m Andrei Kvapil, but you might know me as @kvaps in communities dedicated to Kubernetes and cloud-native tools. In this article, I want to share how we implemented our own extension api-server in the open-source PaaS platform, Cozystack. Kubernetes truly amazes me with its powerful extensibility features. You&amp;rsquo;re probably already familiar with the controller concept and frameworks like kubebuilder and operator-sdk that help you implement it. In a nutshell, they allow you to extend your Kubernetes cluster by defining custom resources (CRDs) and writing additional controllers that handle your business logic for reconciling and managing these kinds of resources. This approach is well-documented, with a wealth of information available online on how to develop your own operators. However, this is not the only way to extend the Kubernetes API. For more complex scenarios such as implementing imperative logic, managing subresources, and dynamically generating responses—the Kubernetes API aggregation layer provides an effective alternative. Through the aggregation layer, you can develop a custom extension API server and seamlessly integrate it within the broader Kubernetes API framework. In this article, I will explore the API aggregation layer, the types of challenges it is well-suited to address, cases where it may be less appropriate, and how we utilized this model to implement our own extension API server in Cozystack. First, let&amp;rsquo;s get definitions straight to avoid any confusion down the road. The API aggregation layer is a feature in Kubernetes, while an extension api-server is a specific implementation of an API server for the aggregation layer.</description></item><item><title>Bottlerocket AMIs that use FIPS 140-3</title><link>https://kubermates.org/releases/2024-11-20-bottlerocket-amis-that-use-fips-140-3/</link><pubDate>Wed, 20 Nov 2024 19:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/releases/2024-11-20-bottlerocket-amis-that-use-fips-140-3/</guid><description>Help improve this page To contribute to this user guide, choose the Edit this page on GitHub link that is located in the right pane of every page.

Our team is composed of members who actively contribute to Kubernetes, including individuals who hold roles such as member, reviewer, approver, and chair. Our goal is to increase the number of Kubernetes contributors and foster the growth of the community. While Kubernetes community is friendly and collaborative, newcomers may find the first step of contributing to be a bit challenging. Our training program aims to lower that barrier and create an environment where even beginners can participate smoothly. Our training started in 2019 and is held 1 to 2 times a year. Initially, Kubernetes Upstream Training was conducted as a co-located event of KubeCon (Kubernetes Contributor Summit), but we launched Kubernetes Upstream Training in Japan with the aim of increasing Japanese contributors by hosting a similar event in Japan. Before the pandemic, the training was held in person, but since 2020, it has been conducted online. The training offers the following content for those who have not yet contributed to Kubernetes: At the beginning of the program, we explain why contributing to Kubernetes is important and who can contribute. We emphasize that contributing to Kubernetes allows you to make a global impact and that Kubernetes community is looking forward to your contributions! We also explain Kubernetes community, SIGs, and Working Groups. Next, we explain the roles and responsibilities of Member, Reviewer, Approver, Tech Lead, and Chair.

In this interview, Sandeep Kanabar , a deaf member of the DHHWG and part of the Kubernetes SIG ContribEx Communications team , sits down with Catherine to explore the impact of the DHHWG on cloud native projects like Kubernetes. Sandeep’s journey is a testament to the power of inclusion. Through his involvement in the DHHWG, he connected with members of the Kubernetes community who encouraged him to join SIG ContribEx - the group responsible for sustaining the Kubernetes contributor experience. In an ecosystem where open-source projects are actively seeking contributors and maintainers, this story highlights how important it is to create pathways for underrepresented groups, including those with disabilities, to contribute their unique perspectives and skills. In this interview, we delve into Catherine’s journey, the challenges and triumphs of establishing the DHHWG, and the vision for a more inclusive future in cloud native. We invite Kubernetes contributors, maintainers, and community members to reflect on the significance of empathy, advocacy, and community in fostering a truly inclusive environment for all, and to think about how they can support efforts to increase diversity and accessibility within their own projects.

Firstly, I got to know about GSoC and Kubeflow with the recommendation from the former active maintainer Ce Gao(gaocegege)’s personal blog. And I was deeply impressed by the idea of cloud native AI toolkits, I decided to dive into this area and learn some skills to enhance my career and future. In the blog, I’ll provide my personal insight into Katib, for those who are interested in cloud native, AI, and hyperparameters tuning. The project aims to provide a Python SDK API interface for users to push metrics to Katib DB directly. The current implementation of Metrics Collector is pull-based, raising design problems such as determining the frequency at which we scrape the metrics, performance issues like the overhead caused by too many sidecar containers, and restrictions on developing environments that must support sidecar containers and admission webhooks. And also, for data scientists, they need to pay attention to the format of metrics printed in the training scripts, which is error prone and may be hard to recognize. We decided to implement a new API for Katib Python SDK to offer users a push-based way to store metrics directly into the Kaitb DB and resolve those issues raised by pull-based metrics collection. In the new design, users just need to set metrics_collector_config={&amp;ldquo;kind&amp;rdquo;: &amp;ldquo;Push&amp;rdquo;} in the tune() function and call the report_metrics() API in their objective function to push metrics to Katib DB directly. There are no sidecar containers and restricted metric log formats any more. After that, Trial Controller will continuously collect metrics from Katib DB and update the status of Trial, which is the same as pull-based metrics collection. If you are interested in it, please refer to this doc and example for more details.</description></item><item><title>Capsule: How to Use It and First Steps to Set It Up on an AKS Cluster 🚀</title><link>https://kubermates.org/blog/capsule-how-to-use-it-and-first-steps-to-set-it-up-on-an-aks-cluster-5hl5/</link><pubDate>Tue, 24 Sep 2024 19:24:03 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/blog/capsule-how-to-use-it-and-first-steps-to-set-it-up-on-an-aks-cluster-5hl5/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Capsule is an awesome, open-source solution that helps you manage multiple tenants in Kubernetes clusters, making it super easy to handle multi-tenancy.

My project focused on developing a high-level API for optimizing hyperparameters in Large Language Models (LLMs) within Katib, Kubeflow’s automated hyperparameter tuning system. I’d like to share insights from this experience with others interested in Kubeflow, GSoC, or optimizing LLMs. The rapid advancements and rising popularity of LLMs, such as GPT and BERT, have created a growing demand for efficient LLMOps in Kubernetes. To address this, we have developed a train API within the Training Python SDK, simplifying the process of fine-tuning LLMs using distributed PyTorchJob workers. However, hyperparameter optimization remains a crucial yet labor-intensive task for enhancing model performance. Hyperparameter optimization is essential but time-consuming, especially for LLMs with billions of parameters. This API simplifies the process by handling Kubernetes infrastructure, allowing data scientists to focus on model performance rather than system configuration. With this API, users can import pretrained models and datasets from Hugging Face and Amazon S3, define parameters including the hyperparameter search space, optimization objective, and resource configuration. The API then automates the creation of Experiment, which contains multiple Trials with different hyperparameter settings using PyTorch distributed training. It then collects and analyzes the metrics from each Trial to identify the optimal hyperparameter configuration. For detailed instruction on using the API, please refer to this guide My work on the project can be broadly divided into four stages: In addition, I addressed several critical bugs in previous Katib and Training Operator releases and contributed new features, such as writing end-to-end tests for the train API.</description></item><item><title>Admission Controllers in Kubernetes: OPA GateKeeper, Kyverno, and Azure Policy Add-on for AKS—Which One Wins? 🏆</title><link>https://kubermates.org/blog/admission-controllers-in-kubernetes-opa-gatekeeper-kyverno-and-azure-policy-add-on-for-aks-which-one-wins-237d/</link><pubDate>Tue, 17 Sep 2024 07:25:52 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/blog/admission-controllers-in-kubernetes-opa-gatekeeper-kyverno-and-azure-policy-add-on-for-aks-which-one-wins-237d/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;When managing a Kubernetes cluster, controlling what gets deployed and ensuring resources comply with security, governance, and operational policies is essential.

Let’s break these down with some easy-to-understand examples.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="1-pod-topology-spread-constraints"&gt;1. Pod Topology Spread Constraints&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Think of &lt;strong&gt;Pod Topology Spread Constraints&lt;/strong&gt; as a way to tell Kubernetes, &amp;ldquo;Hey, I want my Pods spread out evenly across different parts of my cluster.&amp;rdquo; This helps prevent all your Pods from ending up in the same spot, which could be a problem if that spot has an issue.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>How to Test the Latest Kubernetes Changes in Version 1.31 "Elli"</title><link>https://kubermates.org/blog/how-to-test-the-latest-kubernetes-changes-in-version-131-elli-39ec/</link><pubDate>Wed, 14 Aug 2024 21:38:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/blog/how-to-test-the-latest-kubernetes-changes-in-version-131-elli-39ec/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Testing Kubernetes 1.31 &amp;ldquo;Elli&amp;rdquo; involves setting up a dedicated environment, verifying new features, validating API changes, running automated tests, and closely monitoring your cluster. Here’s a detailed guide with examples for each step.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="1-set-up-a-testing-environment"&gt;1. Set Up a Testing Environment&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Create a Kubernetes Cluster&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Example&lt;/strong&gt;: Use Minikube to create a local cluster. Run:
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"&gt;&lt;code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;&lt;span class="cl"&gt;minikube start --kubernetes-version&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;v1.31.0
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;This command sets up a Kubernetes 1.31 cluster locally, allowing you to test the new features and changes in a controlled environment.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cloud-Based Testing&lt;/strong&gt;: For cloud environments, use a tool like &lt;code&gt;eksctl&lt;/code&gt; for Amazon EKS:
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"&gt;&lt;code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;&lt;span class="cl"&gt;eksctl create cluster --version 1.31 --name test-cluster
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;This command creates an Amazon EKS cluster with Kubernetes 1.31, suitable for more extensive testing scenarios.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Isolate the Environment&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Observe deleted Kubernetes components in Grafana Cloud to boost troubleshooting and resource management</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2024-08-08-observe-deleted-kubernetes-components-in-grafana-cloud-to-boost-troubleshooting-/</link><pubDate>Thu, 08 Aug 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2024-08-08-observe-deleted-kubernetes-components-in-grafana-cloud-to-boost-troubleshooting-/</guid><description>Elizabeth Burkly Â· 26 Aug 2025 Â· 9 min read With our Voice of Customer program, we can tighten the loop between what our users ask for and what we prioritize in R&amp;amp;D.

Frederico (FSM): Hello, and thank your for your time. To start with, could you tell us about yourselves and how you got involved in Kubernetes? David : I started working on OpenShift (the Red Hat distribution of Kubernetes) in the fall of 2014 and got involved pretty quickly in API Machinery. My first PRs were fixing kube-apiserver error messages and from there I branched out to kubectl ( kubeconfigs are my fault!), auth ( RBAC and *Review APIs are ports from OpenShift), apps ( workqueues and sharedinformers for example). Don’t tell the others, but API Machinery is still my favorite :) Federico : I was not as early in Kubernetes as David, but now it’s been more than six years. At my previous company we were starting to use Kubernetes for our own products, and when I came across the opportunity to work directly with Kubernetes I left everything and boarded the ship (no pun intended). I joined Google and Kubernetes in early 2018, and have been involved since. FSM: It only takes a quick look at the SIG API Machinery charter to see that it has quite a significant scope, nothing less than the Kubernetes control plane. Could you describe this scope in your own words? David : We own the kube-apiserver and how to efficiently use it. On the backend, that includes its contract with backend storage and how it allows API schema evolution over time. On the frontend, that includes schema best practices, serialization, client patterns, and controller patterns on top of all of it. Federico : Kubernetes has a lot of different components, but the control plane has a really critical mission: it’s your communication layer with the cluster and also owns all the extensibility mechanisms that make Kubernetes so powerful.</description></item><item><title>Monitor these Kubernetes signals to help rightsize your fleet</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2024-07-29-monitor-these-kubernetes-signals-to-help-rightsize-your-fleet/</link><pubDate>Mon, 29 Jul 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2024-07-29-monitor-these-kubernetes-signals-to-help-rightsize-your-fleet/</guid><description>Serena Kei Â· 15 Jul 2025 Â· 4 min read The latest backend update to our Kubernetes Monitoring app in Grafana Cloud features significant improvements to alert rules and recording rules that.

A model registry provides a central catalog for ML model developers to index and manage models, versions, and ML artifacts metadata. It fills a gap between model experimentation and production activities. It provides a central interface for all stakeholders in the ML lifecycle to collaborate on ML models. Model registry has been asked by the community for a long time and we are delighted to introduce it to the Kubeflow ecosystem. This initial release includes REST APIs and a Python SDK to track model artifacts and model metadata with a standardized format that can be reused across Kubeflow components, such as to deploy Inference Servers. You can get started by following the Model Registry tutorial on the Kubeflow website , or see a short demo video of the Model Registry in action. We are just getting started. This is an Alpha version and we look forward to feedback.</description></item><item><title>Blog: Spotlight on SIG Node</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2024-06-20-blog-spotlight-on-sig-node/</link><pubDate>Thu, 20 Jun 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2024-06-20-blog-spotlight-on-sig-node/</guid><description>In the world of container orchestration, Kubernetes reigns supreme, powering some of the most complex and dynamic applications across the globe.

This is where conformance testing becomes crucial, verifying that a Kubernetes cluster meets the required standards set by the community. Today, we’re thrilled to introduce Hydrophone , a lightweight runner designed to streamline Kubernetes tests using the official conformance images released by the Kubernetes release team. Hydrophone’s design philosophy centers around ease of use. By starting the conformance image as a pod within the conformance namespace, Hydrophone waits for the tests to conclude, then prints and exports the results. This approach offers a hassle-free method for running either individual tests or the entire Conformance Test Suite. In the Kubernetes world, where providers like EKS, Rancher, and k3s offer diverse environments, ensuring consistent experiences is vital. This consistency is anchored in conformance testing, which validates whether these environments adhere to Kubernetes community standards. Historically, this validation has either been cumbersome or requires third-party tools. Hydrophone offers a simple, single binary tool that streamlines running these essential conformance tests. It’s designed to be user-friendly, allowing for straightforward validation of Kubernetes clusters against community benchmarks, ensuring providers can offer a certified, consistent service. Hydrophone doesn’t aim to replace the myriad of Kubernetes testing frameworks out there but rather to complement them.</description></item><item><title>Blog: Migrate to Google Artifact Registry</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2024-05-06-blog-migrate-to-google-artifact-registry/</link><pubDate>Mon, 06 May 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2024-05-06-blog-migrate-to-google-artifact-registry/</guid><description>Google has announced that container registry will be shut down some time after March 18, 2025.

The Kubeflow Spark Operator simplifies the deployment and management of Apache Spark applications on Kubernetes. This announcement isn’t just about a new piece of technology, it’s about building a stronger, open-governed, and more collaborative community around Spark on Kubernetes. The journey of the Kubeflow Spark Operator began with Google Cloud Platform’s Spark on Kubernetes Operator (https://cloud. google. com/blog/products/data-analytics/data-analytics-meet-containers-kubernetes-operator-for-apache-spark-now-in-beta). With over 2. 3k stars and 1. 3k forks on GitHub, this project laid the foundation for a robust Spark on Kubernetes experience, enabling users to deploy Spark workloads seamlessly across Kubernetes clusters. Growth and innovation require not just code but also community. Acknowledging the resource and time limitations faced by Google Cloud’s original maintainers, Kubeflow has taken up the mantle. This transition is not merely administrative but a strategic move towards fostering a vibrant, diverse, and more actively engaged community.</description></item><item><title>Blog: Spotlight on SIG Architecture: Code Organization</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2024-04-11-blog-spotlight-on-sig-architecture-code-organization/</link><pubDate>Thu, 11 Apr 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2024-04-11-blog-spotlight-on-sig-architecture-code-organization/</guid><description>This is the third interview of a SIG Architecture Spotlight series that will cover the different subprojects. We will cover SIG Architecture: Code Organization. In this SIG Architecture spotlight I talked with Madhav Jivrajani (VMware), a member of the Code Organization subproject. Frederico (FSM) : Hello Madhav, thank you for your availability. Could you start by telling us a bit about yourself, your role and how you got involved in Kubernetes? Madhav Jivrajani (MJ) : Hello! My name is Madhav Jivrajani, I serve as a technical lead for SIG Contributor Experience and a GitHub Admin for the Kubernetes project. Apart from that I also contribute to SIG API Machinery and SIG Etcd, but more recently, I’ve been helping out with the work that is needed to help Kubernetes stay on supported versions of Go , and it is through this that I am involved with the Code Organization subproject of SIG Architecture. FSM : A project the size of Kubernetes must have unique challenges in terms of code organization – is this a fair assumption? If so, what would you pick as some of the main challenges that are specific to Kubernetes? MJ : That’s a fair assumption! The first interesting challenge comes from the sheer size of the Kubernetes codebase. We have ≅2. 2 million lines of Go code (which is steadily decreasing thanks to dims and other folks in this sub-project!), and a little over 240 dependencies that we rely on either directly or indirectly, which is why having a sub-project dedicated to helping out with dependency management is crucial: we need to know what dependencies we’re pulling in, what versions these dependencies are at, and tooling to help make sure we are managing these dependencies across different parts of the codebase in a consistent manner. Another interesting challenge with Kubernetes is that we publish a lot of Go modules as part of the Kubernetes release cycles, one example of this is client-go. However, we as a project would also like the benefits of having everything in one repository to get the advantages of using a monorepo, like atomic commits… so, because of this, code organization works with other SIGs (like SIG Release) to automate the process of publishing code from the monorepo to downstream individual repositories which are much easier to consume, and this way you won’t have to import the entire Kubernetes codebase! FSM : For someone just starting contributing to Kubernetes code-wise, what are the main things they should consider in terms of code organization? How would you sum up the key concepts? MJ : I think one of the key things to keep in mind at least as you’re starting off is the concept of staging directories. In the kubernetes/kubernetes repository, you will come across a directory called staging/.</description></item><item><title>Blog: Using Go workspaces in Kubernetes</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2024-03-19-blog-using-go-workspaces-in-kubernetes/</link><pubDate>Tue, 19 Mar 2024 08:30:00 -0800</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2024-03-19-blog-using-go-workspaces-in-kubernetes/</guid><description>The Go programming language has played a huge role in the success of Kubernetes. As Kubernetes has grown, matured, and pushed the bounds of what “regular” projects do, the Go project team has also grown and evolved the language and tools. In recent releases, Go introduced a feature called “workspaces” which was aimed at making projects like Kubernetes easier to manage. We’ve just completed a major effort to adopt workspaces in Kubernetes, and the results are great. Our codebase is simpler and less error-prone, and we’re no longer off on our own technology island. Kubernetes is one of the most visible open source projects written in Go. The earliest versions of Kubernetes, dating back to 2014, were built with Go 1. 3. Today, 10 years later, Go is up to version 1. 22 — and let’s just say that a whole lot has changed. In 2014, Go development was entirely based on GOPATH. As a Go project, Kubernetes lived by the rules of GOPATH.</description></item><item><title>Grafana Labs at KubeCon: eBPF, sustainability, Prometheus, and more</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2024-03-15-grafana-labs-at-kubecon-ebpf-sustainability-prometheus-and-more/</link><pubDate>Fri, 15 Mar 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2024-03-15-grafana-labs-at-kubecon-ebpf-sustainability-prometheus-and-more/</guid><description>Colin Steele Â· 22 Aug 2025 Â· 5 min read Learn how Beyla, eBPF, and OpenTelemetry combine to make homelab observability easy with this recap of a recent GrafanaCON 2025 session.

How does this whole process of integration of Kubernetes to various cloud providers happen? To answer that, let’s put the spotlight on SIG Cloud Provider. SIG Cloud Provider works to create seamless integrations between Kubernetes and various cloud providers. Their mission? Keeping the Kubernetes ecosystem fair and open for all. By setting clear standards and requirements, they ensure every cloud provider plays nicely with Kubernetes. It is their responsibility to configure cluster components to enable cloud provider integrations. In this blog of the SIG Spotlight series, Arujjwal Negi interviews Michael McCune (Red Hat), also known as elmiko , co-chair of SIG Cloud Provider, to give us an insight into the workings of this group. Arujjwal : Let’s start by getting to know you. Can you give us a small intro about yourself and how you got into Kubernetes? Michael : Hi, I’m Michael McCune, most people around the community call me by my handle, elmiko. I’ve been a software developer for a long time now (Windows 3. 1 was popular when I started!), and I’ve been involved with open-source software for most of my career. I first got involved with Kubernetes as a developer of machine learning and data science applications; the team I was on at the time was creating tutorials and examples to demonstrate the use of technologies like Apache Spark on Kubernetes. That said, I’ve been interested in distributed systems for many years and when an opportunity arose to join a team working directly on Kubernetes, I jumped at it! Arujjwal : Can you give us an insight into what SIG Cloud Provider does and how it functions? Michael : SIG Cloud Provider was formed to help ensure that Kubernetes provides a neutral integration point for all infrastructure providers.</description></item><item><title>Blog: A look into the Kubernetes Book Club</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2024-02-22-blog-a-look-into-the-kubernetes-book-club/</link><pubDate>Thu, 22 Feb 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2024-02-22-blog-a-look-into-the-kubernetes-book-club/</guid><description>Learning Kubernetes and the entire ecosystem of technologies around it is not without its challenges. In this interview, we will talk with Carlos Santana (AWS) to learn a bit more about how he created the Kubernetes Book Club , how it works, and how anyone can join in to take advantage of a community-based learning experience. Frederico Muñoz (FSM) : Hello Carlos, thank you so much for your availability. To start with, could you tell us a bit about yourself? Carlos Santana (CS) : Of course. My experience in deploying Kubernetes in production six years ago opened the door for me to join Knative and then contribute to Kubernetes through the Release Team. Working on upstream Kubernetes has been one of the best experiences I’ve had in open-source. Over the past two years, in my role as a Senior Specialist Solutions Architect at AWS, I have been assisting large enterprises build their internal developer platforms (IDP) on top of Kubernetes. Going forward, my open source contributions are directed towards CNOE and CNCF projects like Argo , Crossplane , and Backstage. FSM : So your path led you to Kubernetes, and at that point what was the motivating factor for starting the Book Club? CS : The idea for the Kubernetes Book Club sprang from a casual suggestion during a TGIK livestream. For me, it was more than just about reading a book; it was about creating a learning community. This platform has not only been a source of knowledge but also a support system, especially during the challenging times of the pandemic. It’s gratifying to see how this initiative has helped members cope and grow.</description></item><item><title>The Linux Foundation Releases Conference Schedule for Open Source Summit North America 2024</title><link>https://kubermates.org/events/2024-02-20-the-linux-foundation-releases-conference-schedule-for-open-source-summit-north-a/</link><pubDate>Tue, 20 Feb 2024 20:50:13 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/events/2024-02-20-the-linux-foundation-releases-conference-schedule-for-open-source-summit-north-a/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;The leading gathering for the global open source community offers 200+ sessions presented through 16 microconferences, exploring the …&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>The Linux Foundation Announces the Embedded Open Source Summit 2024 Schedule</title><link>https://kubermates.org/events/2024-02-20-the-linux-foundation-announces-the-embedded-open-source-summit-2024-schedule/</link><pubDate>Tue, 20 Feb 2024 20:06:52 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/events/2024-02-20-the-linux-foundation-announces-the-embedded-open-source-summit-2024-schedule/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;130+ sessions spotlighting recent advancements and the trajectory of embedded technologies provide exclusive access to leaders propelling innovation …&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Kubernetes alerting: Simplify anomaly detection in Kubernetes clusters with Grafana Cloud</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2024-02-15-kubernetes-alerting-simplify-anomaly-detection-in-kubernetes-clusters-with-grafa/</link><pubDate>Thu, 15 Feb 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2024-02-15-kubernetes-alerting-simplify-anomaly-detection-in-kubernetes-clusters-with-grafa/</guid><description>Alejandro Fraenkel Â· 5 Aug 2025 Â· 9 min read We built a brand new alert rules list page.

Have you ever considered how such a big project like Kubernetes manages its timeline so efficiently to release its new version, or how the internal workings of the Release Team look like? If you’re curious about these questions or want to know more and get involved with the work SIG Release does, read on! SIG Release plays a crucial role in the development and evolution of Kubernetes. Its primary responsibility is to manage the release process of new versions of Kubernetes. It operates on a regular release cycle, typically every three to four months. During this cycle, the Kubernetes Release Team works closely with other SIGs and contributors to ensure a smooth and well-coordinated release. This includes planning the release schedule, setting deadlines for code freeze and testing phases, as well as creating release artefacts like binaries, documentation, and release notes. Before you read further, it is important to note that there are two subprojects under SIG Release - Release Engineering and Release Team. In this blog post, Nitish Kumar interviews Verónica López (PlanetScale), Technical Lead of SIG Release, with the spotlight on the Release Team subproject, how the release process looks like, and ways to get involved. What is the typical release process for a new version of Kubernetes, from initial planning to the final release? Are there any specific methodologies and tools that you use to ensure a smooth release? The release process for a new Kubernetes version is a well-structured and community-driven effort. There are no specific methodologies or tools as such that we follow, except a calendar with a series of steps to keep things organised. The complete release process looks like this: Release Team Onboarding: We start with the formation of a Release Team, which includes volunteers from the Kubernetes community who will be responsible for managing different components of the new release. This is typically done before the previous release is about to wrap up.</description></item><item><title>Blog: Blixt - A load-balancer written in Rust, using eBPF, born from Gateway API</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2024-01-08-blog-blixt-a-load-balancer-written-in-rust-using-ebpf-born-from-gateway-api/</link><pubDate>Mon, 08 Jan 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2024-01-08-blog-blixt-a-load-balancer-written-in-rust-using-ebpf-born-from-gateway-api/</guid><description>In SIG Network we now have a layer 4 (“L4”) load balancer named Blixt. This project started as a fun experiment using emerging technologies and is intended to become a utility for CI and testing to help facilitate the continued development of Gateway API. Are you interested in developing networking tools in Rust and eBPF ? Or perhaps you’re specifically interested in Gateway API? We’ll tell you a bit about the project and how it might benefit you. Blixt originated at Kong as an experiment to test load-balancing ingress traffic for Kubernetes clusters using eBPF for the dataplane. Around the time of Kubecon Detroit (2022) we (the Gateway API maintainers) realized it had significant potential to help us move our TCPRoute and UDPRoute support forward, which had been sort of “stuck in alpha” at the time due to a lack of conformance tests being developed for them. At the same time, various others in the SIG Network community developed an interest in the project due to the rapid growth of eBPFs use on Kubernetes. Given the potential for benefit to the Kubernetes ecosystem and the growing interest, Kong decided it would be helpful to donate the project to Kubernetes SIGs to benefit upstream Kubernetes. Over several months we rewrote the project in Rust (from C), due to a strong contingency of Rust knowledge (and interest) between us developing the project and an active interest in the burgeoning Aya project (a Rust framework for developing eBPF programs). We did eventually move the control plane (specifically) to Golang however, so that we could take advantage of the Kubebuilder and controller-runtime ecosystems. Additionally, we augmented our custom program loader (in eBPF, you generally write loaders that load your BPF byte code into the kernel) with bpfman : a project adjacent to us in the Rust + eBPF ecosystem, which helps solve several security and ergonomic problems with managing BPF programs on Linux systems. After the recently completed license review process , which provided a blanket exception for the use of dual licensed eBPF in CNCF code, the project became officially part of Kubernetes and interest has been growing. We have several goals for the project which revolve around the continued development of Gateway API, with a specific focus on helping mature Layer 4 support (e.</description></item><item><title>Blog: Kubernetes supports running kube-proxy in an unprivileged container</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2024-01-05-blog-kubernetes-supports-running-kube-proxy-in-an-unprivileged-container/</link><pubDate>Fri, 05 Jan 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2024-01-05-blog-kubernetes-supports-running-kube-proxy-in-an-unprivileged-container/</guid><description>This post describes how the &amp;ndash;init-only flag to kube-proxy can be used to run the main kube-proxy container in a stricter securityContext , by performing the configuration that requires privileged mode in a separate init container. Since Windows doesn’t have the equivalent of capabilities , this only works on Linux. The kube-proxy Pod still only meets the privileged Pod Security Standard , but there is still an improvement because the running container doesn’t need to run privileged. Please note that kube-proxy can be installed in different ways. The examples below assume that kube-proxy is run from a pod, but similar changes could be made in clusters where it is run as a system service. It is undesirable to run a server container like kube-proxy in privileged mode. Security aware users wants to use capabilities instead. If kube-proxy is installed as a POD, the initialization requires “privileged” mode, mostly for setting sysctl’s. However, kube-proxy only tries to set the sysctl’s if they don’t already have the right values. In theory, then, if a privileged init container set the sysctls to the right values, then kube-proxy could run unprivileged. The problem is to know what to setup. Until now the only option has been to read the source to see what changes kube-proxy would have made, but with &amp;ndash;init-only you can have kube-proxy itself do the setup exactly as on a normal start, and then exit.</description></item><item><title>Blog: Contextual logging in Kubernetes 1.29: Better troubleshooting and enhanced logging</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2023-12-20-blog-contextual-logging-in-kubernetes-1-29-better-troubleshooting-and-enhanced-l/</link><pubDate>Wed, 20 Dec 2023 09:30:00 -0800</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2023-12-20-blog-contextual-logging-in-kubernetes-1-29-better-troubleshooting-and-enhanced-l/</guid><description>On behalf of the Structured Logging Working Group and SIG Instrumentation , we are pleased to announce that the contextual logging feature introduced in Kubernetes v1. 24 has now been successfully migrated to two components (kube-scheduler and kube-controller-manager) as well as some directories. This feature aims to provide more useful logs for better troubleshooting of Kubernetes and to empower developers to enhance Kubernetes. Contextual logging is based on the go-logr API. The key idea is that libraries are passed a logger instance by their caller and use that for logging instead of accessing a global logger. The binary decides the logging implementation, not the libraries. The go-logr API is designed around structured logging and supports attaching additional information to a logger. This enables additional use cases: The caller can attach additional information to a logger: When passing this extended logger into a function, and the function uses it instead of the global logger, the additional information is then included in all log entries, without having to modify the code that generates the log entries. This is useful in highly parallel applications where it can become hard to identify all log entries for a certain operation, because the output from different operations gets interleaved. When running unit tests, log output can be associated with the current test. Then, when a test fails, only the log output of the failed test gets shown by go test. That output can also be more verbose by default because it will not get shown for successful tests.</description></item><item><title>Blog: Spotlight on SIG Testing</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2023-11-24-blog-spotlight-on-sig-testing/</link><pubDate>Fri, 24 Nov 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2023-11-24-blog-spotlight-on-sig-testing/</guid><description>Welcome to another edition of the SIG spotlight blog series, where we highlight the incredible work being done by various Special Interest Groups (SIGs) within the Kubernetes project. In this edition, we turn our attention to SIG Testing , a group interested in effective testing of Kubernetes and automating away project toil. SIG Testing focus on creating and running tools and infrastructure that make it easier for the community to write and run tests, and to contribute, analyze and act upon test results. To gain some insights into SIG Testing, Sandipan Panda spoke with Michelle Shepardson , a senior software engineer at Google and a chair of SIG Testing, and Patrick Ohly , a software engineer and architect at Intel and a SIG Testing Tech Lead. Sandipan: Could you tell us a bit about yourself, your role, and how you got involved in the Kubernetes project and SIG Testing? Michelle: Hi! I’m Michelle, a senior software engineer at Google. I first got involved in Kubernetes through working on tooling for SIG Testing, like the external instance of TestGrid. I’m part of oncall for TestGrid and Prow, and am now a chair for the SIG. Patrick: Hello! I work as a software engineer and architect in a team at Intel which focuses on open source Cloud Native projects. When I ramped up on Kubernetes to develop a storage driver, my very first question was “how do I test it in a cluster and how do I log information?” That interest led to various enhancement proposals until I had (re)written enough code that also took over official roles as SIG Testing Tech Lead (for the E2E framework ) and structured logging WG lead. Sandipan: Testing is a field in which multiple approaches and tools exist; how did you arrive at the existing practices? Patrick: I can’t speak about the early days because I wasn’t around yet 😆, but looking back at some of the commit history it’s pretty obvious that developers just took what was available and started using it. For E2E testing, that was Ginkgo+Gomega. Some hacks were necessary, for example around cleanup after a test run and for categorising tests.</description></item><item><title>Blog: Kubernetes Contributor Summit: Behind-the-scenes</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2023-11-03-blog-kubernetes-contributor-summit-behind-the-scenes/</link><pubDate>Fri, 03 Nov 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2023-11-03-blog-kubernetes-contributor-summit-behind-the-scenes/</guid><description>Every year, just before the official start of KubeCon+CloudNativeCon, there’s a special event that has a very special place in the hearts of those organizing and participating in it: the Kubernetes Contributor Summit. To find out why, and to provide a behind-the-scenes perspective, we interview Noah Abrahams, whom amongst other roles was the co-lead for the Kubernetes Contributor Summit in 2023. Frederico Muñoz (FSM) : Hello Noah, and welcome. Could you start by introducing yourself and telling us how you got involved in Kubernetes? Noah Abrahams (NA) : I’ve been in this space for quite a while. I got started in IT in the mid 90’s, and I’ve been working in the “Cloud” space for about 15 years. It was, frankly, through a combination of sheer luck (being in the right place at the right time) and having good mentors to pull me into those places (thanks, Tim!), that I ended up at a startup called Apprenda in 2016. While I was there, they pivoted into Kubernetes, and it was the best thing that could have happened to my career. It was around v1. 2 and someone asked me if I could give a presentation on Kubernetes concepts at “my local meetup” in Las Vegas. The meetup didn’t exist yet, so I created it, and got involved in the wider community. One thing led to another, and soon I was involved in ContribEx, joined the release team, was doing booth duty for the CNCF, became an ambassador, and here we are today. FM : Before leading the organisation of the KCSEU 2023, how many other Contributor Summits were you a part of? NA : I was involved in four or five before taking the lead.</description></item><item><title>Blog: Spotlight on SIG Architecture: Production Readiness</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2023-11-02-blog-spotlight-on-sig-architecture-production-readiness/</link><pubDate>Thu, 02 Nov 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2023-11-02-blog-spotlight-on-sig-architecture-production-readiness/</guid><description>This is the second interview of a SIG Architecture Spotlight series that will cover the different subprojects. In this blog, we will cover the SIG Architecture: Production Readiness subproject. In this SIG Architecture spotlight, we talked with Wojciech Tyczynski (Google), lead of the Production Readiness subproject. Frederico (FSM) : Hello Wojciech, could you tell us a bit about yourself, your role and how you got involved in Kubernetes? Wojciech Tyczynski (WT) : I started contributing to Kubernetes in January 2015. At that time, Google (where I was and still am working) decided to start a Kubernetes team in the Warsaw office (in addition to already existing teams in California and Seattle). I was lucky enough to be one of the seeding engineers for that team. After two months of onboarding and helping with different tasks across the project towards 1. 0 launch, I took ownership of the scalability area and I was leading Kubernetes to support clusters with 5000 nodes. I’m still involved in SIG Scalability as its Technical Lead. That was the start of a journey since scalability is such a cross-cutting topic, and I started contributing to many other areas including, over time, to SIG Architecture. FSM : In SIG Architecture, why specifically the Production Readiness subproject? Was it something you had in mind from the start, or was it an unexpected consequence of your initial involvement in scalability? WT : After reaching that milestone of Kubernetes supporting 5000-node clusters , one of the goals was to ensure that Kubernetes would not degrade its scalability properties over time. While non-scalable implementation is always fixable, designing non-scalable APIs or contracts is problematic.</description></item><item><title>Blog: A Quick Recap of 2023 China Kubernetes Contributor Summit</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2023-10-20-blog-a-quick-recap-of-2023-china-kubernetes-contributor-summit/</link><pubDate>Fri, 20 Oct 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2023-10-20-blog-a-quick-recap-of-2023-china-kubernetes-contributor-summit/</guid><description>On September 26, 2023, the first day of KubeCon + CloudNativeCon + Open Source Summit China 2023 , nearly 50 contributors gathered in Shanghai for the Kubernetes Contributor Summit. All participants in the 2023 Kubernetes Contributor Summit This marked the first in-person offline gathering held in China after three years of the pandemic. The event began with welcome speeches from Kevin Wang from Huawei Cloud, one of the co-chairs of KubeCon, and Puja from Giant Swarm. Following the opening remarks, the contributors introduced themselves briefly. Most attendees were from China, while some contributors had made the journey from Europe and the United States specifically for the conference. Technical experts from companies such as Microsoft, Intel, Huawei, as well as emerging forces like DaoCloud, were present. Laughter and cheerful voices filled the room, regardless of whether English was spoken with European or American accents or if conversations were carried out in authentic Chinese language. This created an atmosphere of comfort, joy, respect, and anticipation. Past contributions brought everyone closer, and mutual recognition and accomplishments made this offline gathering possible. Face to face meeting in Shanghai The attending contributors were no longer just GitHub IDs; they transformed into vivid faces. From sitting together and capturing group photos to attempting to identify “Who is who,” a loosely connected collective emerged. This team structure, although loosely knit and free-spirited, was established to pursue shared dreams.</description></item><item><title>Blog: Spotlight on SIG Architecture: Conformance</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2023-10-05-blog-spotlight-on-sig-architecture-conformance/</link><pubDate>Thu, 05 Oct 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2023-10-05-blog-spotlight-on-sig-architecture-conformance/</guid><description>This is the first interview of a SIG Architecture Spotlight series that will cover the different subprojects. We start with the SIG Architecture: Conformance subproject In this SIG Architecture spotlight, we talked with Riaan Kleinhans (ii-Team), Lead for the Conformance sub-project. Frederico (FSM) : Hello Riaan, and welcome! For starters, tell us a bit about yourself, your role and how you got involved in Kubernetes. Riaan Kleinhans (RK) : Hi! My name is Riaan Kleinhans and I live in South Africa. I am the Project manager for the ii-Team in New Zealand. When I joined ii the plan was to move to New Zealand in April 2020 and then Covid happened. Fortunately, being a flexible and dynamic team we were able to make it work remotely and in very different time zones. The ii. nz team have been tasked with managing the Kubernetes Conformance testing technical debt and writing tests to clear the technical debt. I stepped into the role of project manager to be the link between monitoring, test writing and the community. Through that work I had the privilege of meeting the late Dan Kohn in those first months, his enthusiasm about the work we were doing was a great inspiration. FSM : Thank you - so, your involvement in SIG Architecture started because of the conformance work?

In this blog post, we’ll be shining a spotlight on the Special Interest Group for Contributor Experience (SIG ContribEx), an essential component of the Kubernetes project. SIG ContribEx in Kubernetes is responsible for developing and maintaining a healthy and productive community of contributors to the project. This involves identifying and addressing bottlenecks that may hinder the project’s growth and feature velocity, such as pull request latency and the number of open pull requests and issues. SIG ContribEx works to improve the overall contributor experience by creating and maintaining guidelines, tools, and processes that facilitate collaboration and communication among contributors. They also focus on community building and support, including outreach programs and mentorship initiatives to onboard and retain new contributors. Ultimately, the role of SIG ContribEx is to foster a welcoming and inclusive environment that encourages contribution and supports the long-term sustainability of the Kubernetes project. In this blog post, Fyka Ansari interviews Kaslin Fields , a DevRel Engineer at Google, who is a chair of SIG ContribEx, and Madhav Jivrajani , a Software Engineer at VMWare who serves as a SIG ContribEx Tech Lead. This interview covers various aspects of SIG ContribEx, including current initiatives, exciting developments, and how interested individuals can get involved and contribute to the group. It provides valuable insights into the workings of SIG ContribEx and highlights the importance of its role in the Kubernetes ecosystem. Fyka: Let’s start by diving into your background and how you got involved in the Kubernetes ecosystem. Can you tell us more about that journey? Kaslin: I first got involved in the Kubernetes ecosystem through my mentor, Jonathan Rippy, who introduced me to containers during my early days in tech. Eventually, I transitioned to a team working with containers, which sparked my interest in Kubernetes when it was announced.</description></item><item><title>Blog: Spotlight on SIG CLI</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2023-07-20-blog-spotlight-on-sig-cli/</link><pubDate>Thu, 20 Jul 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2023-07-20-blog-spotlight-on-sig-cli/</guid><description>In the world of Kubernetes, managing containerized applications at scale requires powerful and efficient tools. The command-line interface (CLI) is an integral part of any developer or operator’s toolkit, offering a convenient and flexible way to interact with a Kubernetes cluster. SIG CLI plays a crucial role in improving the Kubernetes CLI experience by focusing on the development and enhancement of kubectl , the primary command-line tool for Kubernetes. In this SIG CLI Spotlight, Arpit Agrawal, SIG ContribEx-Comms team member, talked with Katrina Verey , Tech Lead &amp;amp; Chair of SIG CLI,and Maciej Szulik , SIG CLI Batch Lead, about SIG CLI, current projects, challenges and how anyone can get involved. So, whether you are a seasoned Kubernetes enthusiast or just getting started, understanding the significance of SIG CLI will undoubtedly enhance your Kubernetes journey. Arpit : Could you tell us a bit about yourself, your role, and how you got involved in SIG CLI? Maciej : I’m one of the technical leads for SIG-CLI. I was working on Kubernetes in multiple areas since 2014, and in 2018 I got appointed a lead. Katrina : I’ve been working with Kubernetes as an end-user since 2016, but it was only in late 2019 that I discovered how well SIG CLI aligned with my experience from internal projects. I started regularly attending meetings and made a few small PRs, and by 2021 I was working more deeply with the Kustomize team specifically. Later that year, I was appointed to my current roles as subproject owner for Kustomize and KRM Functions, and as SIG CLI Tech Lead and Chair. Arpit : Thank you! Could you share with us the purpose and goals of SIG CLI? Maciej : Our charter has the most detailed description, but in few words, we handle all CLI tooling that helps you manage your Kubernetes manifests and interact with your Kubernetes clusters. Arpit : I see.</description></item><item><title>Blog: Improve your changelogs</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2023-05-24-blog-improve-your-changelogs/</link><pubDate>Wed, 24 May 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2023-05-24-blog-improve-your-changelogs/</guid><description>A standard part of the Jenkins X pipelines since a long time is the execution of jx changelog create that takes the commit messages between the release currently being created and the previous one and creates a change log from these. The change log is then stored as a release note in GitHub or other git provider. During the last year some improvements have landed in various Jenkins X components to improve the changelogs and their usefulness. So I’ll take this opportunity to describe these improvements and also in general give hints to how to get useful changelogs. Changelogs haven’t been very informative with regard to upgrades, ie those applied with jx promote or jx updatebot. One example of this is the release notes of jx after the split out of most functionality to plugins. Lately these have improved due to new functionality to propagate changelogs via pull requests. One place where changelogs have been completely lacking is in cluster repositories. But using the functionality for propagation of changelogs and some changes in jx boot job you can now a get a changelog for every successful application of changes in a cluster. An example of what this functionality achieves can be seen in a release of jx: https://github. com/jenkins-x/jx/releases/tag/v3. 10.</description></item><item><title>Blog: Spotlight on SIG Network</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2023-05-09-blog-spotlight-on-sig-network/</link><pubDate>Tue, 09 May 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2023-05-09-blog-spotlight-on-sig-network/</guid><description>Networking is one of the core pillars of Kubernetes, and the Special Interest Group for Networking (SIG Network) is responsible for developing and maintaining the networking features of Kubernetes. It covers all aspects to ensure Kubernetes provides a reliable and scalable network infrastructure for containerized applications. In this SIG Network spotlight, Sujay Dey talked with Shane Utt , Software Engineer at Kong, chair of SIG Network and maintainer of Gateway API, on different aspects of the SIG, what are the exciting things going on and how anyone can get involved and contribute here. Sujay : Hello, and first of all, thanks for the opportunity of learning more about SIG Network. I would love to hear your story, so could you please tell us a bit about yourself, your role, and how you got involved in Kubernetes, especially in SIG Network? Shane : Hello! Thank you for reaching out. My Kubernetes journey started while I was working for a small data centre: we were early adopters of Kubernetes and focused on using Kubernetes to provide SaaS products. That experience led to my next position developing a distribution of Kubernetes with a focus on networking. During this period in my career, I was active in SIG Network (predominantly as a consumer). When I joined Kong my role in the community changed significantly, as Kong actively encourages upstream participation. I greatly increased my engagement and contributions to the Gateway API project during those years, and eventually became a maintainer. I care deeply about this community and the future of our technology, so when a chair position for the SIG became available, I volunteered my time immediately. I’ve enjoyed working on Kubernetes over the better part of a decade and I want to continue to do my part to ensure our community and technology continues to flourish.</description></item><item><title>Blog: E2E Testing Best Practices, Reloaded</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2023-04-12-blog-e2e-testing-best-practices-reloaded/</link><pubDate>Wed, 12 Apr 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2023-04-12-blog-e2e-testing-best-practices-reloaded/</guid><description>End-to-end (E2E) testing in Kubernetes is how the project validates functionality with real clusters. Contributors sooner or later encounter it when asked to write E2E tests for new features or to help with debugging test failures. Cluster admins or vendors might run the conformance tests, a subset of all tests in the E2E test suite. The underlying E2E framework for writing these E2E tests has been around for a long time. Functionality was added to it as needed, leading to code that became hard to maintain and use. The testing commons WG started cleaning it up, but dissolved before completely achieving their goals. After the migration to Gingko v2 in Kubernetes 1. 25, I picked up several of the loose ends and started untangling them. This blog post is a summary of those changes. Some of this content is also found in the Kubernetes contributor document about writing good E2E tests and gets reproduced here to raise awareness that the document has been updated. At the moment, the framework is used in-tree for testing against a cluster ( test/e2e ), testing kubeadm ( test/e2e_kubeadm ) and kubelet ( test/e2e_node ). The goal is to make the core test/e2e/framework a package that has no dependencies on internal code and that can be used in different E2E suites without polluting them with features or options that make no sense for them.</description></item><item><title>Blog: From Zero to Kubernets Subproject Lead</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2023-03-29-blog-from-zero-to-kubernets-subproject-lead/</link><pubDate>Wed, 29 Mar 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2023-03-29-blog-from-zero-to-kubernets-subproject-lead/</guid><description>Getting started in any open-source community can be daunting, especially if it’s a big one like Kubernetes. I wrote this post to share my experience and encourage others to join up. All it takes is some curiosity and a willingness to show up! Here’s how my journey unfolded at a high level: First things first. What are you interested in learning more about? There are so many wonderful SIGs and working groups in the Kubernetes community: there’s something for everyone. And continuing to show up and participate will be so much easier if you think what you are doing is interesting. Likewise, continued participation is what keeps the community thriving, so that interest will drive you to have more of an impact. Also: it’s ok to show up knowing nothing! I remember showing up knowing very little about Kubernetes or how the community itself worked. And while I know more about how the community functions today, I am still learning all the time about it and the project.

You can find more details about this here. There are some drawbacks with kubectl apply though. The one that made me start looking for alternatives was that if you remove a resource from your cluster repository it may not be removed from your cluster. The way deletion works with kubectl apply is that it is handed the option &amp;ndash;prune which will remove resources that are not in the manifests. Except that it doesn’t always work as expected. It will only remove certain kinds of resources defined in kubectl. In my case I removed an HorizontalPodAutoscaler from my cluster repository, but it wasn’t removed from my cluster. When trying to find a solution to this I first tried to override this default list in kubectl of things to prune, but this turned out to be difficult in the general case. I also tried the already existing alternative of using kapp to apply the manifests, but I couldn’t get that to work. Looking for other options I settled for kpt live apply. You enable the use of kpt live apply by adding to the Makefile of your cluster repository anywhere before include versionStream/src/Makefile.</description></item><item><title>Blog: Introducing KWOK: Kubernetes WithOut Kubelet</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2023-03-01-blog-introducing-kwok-kubernetes-without-kubelet/</link><pubDate>Wed, 01 Mar 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2023-03-01-blog-introducing-kwok-kubernetes-without-kubelet/</guid><description>Author: Shiming Zhang (DaoCloud), Wei Huang (Apple), Yibo Zhuang (Apple) Have you ever wondered how to set up a cluster of thousands of nodes just in seconds, how to simulate real nodes with a low resource footprint, and how to test your Kubernetes controller at scale without spending much on infrastructure? If you answered “yes” to any of these questions, then you might be interested in KWOK, a toolkit that enables you to create a cluster of thousands of nodes in seconds. KWOK stands for Kubernetes WithOut Kubelet. So far, it provides two tools: KWOK has several advantages: KWOK can be used for various purposes: KWOK is not intended to replace others completely. It has some limitations that you should be aware of: If you are interested in trying out KWOK, please check its documents for more details.

In the passing year a couple of functionalities has been added to help with this. To avoid maintaining the OWNERS_ALIASES file in many repositories you can now refer to the OWNERS_ALIASES file in another repository. In the Jenkins X project we have the main OWNERS_ALIASES file in the jx-community repository. So in the jx repository the OWNERS_ALIASES file only looks like this: The organisation defaults to be the same as for the repository, but can specify as well. So in the jx-project repository the OWNERS_ALIASES file looks like this: Using the filed ref you can also specify a branch or tag to use instead of the default one of the repository. When creating or importing a repository using jx project the default content of OWNERS and OWNERS_ALIASES isn’t that useful since only the current user are put in the files. If you create your own quickstarts you place the OWNERS and / or OWNERS_ALIASES files with the content of your liking in those. A recent new functionality is that you can put OWNERS and / or OWNERS_ALIASES files in the extensions directory of your cluster repository. These files will then be used as the default content of the files in new repositories.</description></item><item><title>Blog: Project ideas for Google Summer of Code 2023 ☀️</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2023-02-06-blog-project-ideas-for-google-summer-of-code-2023/</link><pubDate>Mon, 06 Feb 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2023-02-06-blog-project-ideas-for-google-summer-of-code-2023/</guid><description>We have put together some project ideas as part of our application to participate in the Google Summer of Code 2023 program. The cdEvents project standardises the way systems talk to each other, which enables Interoperability between systems so they speak a common language through the cdEvents spec in the event. Creating a capability in Jenkins X that can receive and sent a cdEvent would benefit the project and the DevOps ecosystem in general, by stopping glue code used to integrate systems and power innovation by letting end users swap out tools with no effort. Jenkins X, Kubernetes, golang, cdEvents 350 hours Hard Jenkins X only applies changes to cluster when contents of the gitops repository changes as part of a git pull request or git commit. This does not satisfy one of the requirements of the gitops model where we need continuous reconciliation. It would be nice to detect drift between the current state (kubernetes) and the desired state (git) and apply only those changes. This has the side effect of making the boot job faster. Also, our bootjob is made up of a makefile which calls cli commands written in golang, instead it would be desirable to move to a controller based approach similar to other tools in the kubernetes ecosystem. Kubernetes, golang, Jenkins X, kubebuiler, basic understanding of gitops. 350 hours Hard In the last GSoC project, we created a modern UI which has more functionalities than the older viewer UI. However, as we added the ability to start/stop pipelines from the new UI, this opened up an issue around access.

In the context of Kubernetes, having best practices for cluster observability across all Kubernetes components is crucial. SIG Instrumentation helps to address this issue by providing best practices and tools that all other SIGs use to instrument Kubernetes components-like the API server , scheduler , kubelet and kube-controller-manager. In this SIG Instrumentation spotlight, Imran Noor Mohamed , SIG ContribEx-Comms tech lead talked with Elana Hashman , and Han Kang , chairs of SIG Instrumentation, on how the SIG is organized, what are the current challenges and how anyone can get involved and contribute. Imran (INM) : Hello, thank you for the opportunity of learning more about SIG Instrumentation. Could you tell us a bit about yourself, your role, and how you got involved in SIG Instrumentation? Han (HK) : I started in SIG Instrumentation in 2018, and became a chair in 2020. I primarily got involved with SIG instrumentation due to a number of upstream issues with metrics which ended up affecting GKE in bad ways. As a result, we ended up launching an initiative to stabilize our metrics and make metrics a proper API. Elana (EH) : I also joined SIG Instrumentation in 2018 and became a chair at the same time as Han. I was working as a site reliability engineer (SRE) on bare metal Kubernetes clusters and was working to build out our observability stack. I encountered some issues with label joins where Kubernetes metrics didn’t match kube-state-metrics ( KSM ) and started participating in SIG meetings to improve things. I helped test performance improvements to kube-state-metrics and ultimately coauthored a KEP for overhauling metrics in the 1.</description></item><item><title>Blog: Prow and Tide for Kubernetes Contributors</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2022-12-12-blog-prow-and-tide-for-kubernetes-contributors/</link><pubDate>Mon, 12 Dec 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2022-12-12-blog-prow-and-tide-for-kubernetes-contributors/</guid><description>Authors: Chris Short , Frederico Muñoz In my work in the Kubernetes world, I look up a label or Prow command often. The systems behind the scenes ( Prow and Tide ) are here to help Kubernetes Contributors get stuff done. Labeling which SIG, WG, or subproject is as important as the issue or PR having someone assigned. To quote the docs , “Tide is a Prow component for managing a pool of GitHub PRs that match a given set of criteria. It will automatically retest PRs that meet the criteria (’tide comes in’) and automatically merge them when they have up-to-date passing test results (’tide goes out’). ” What actually prompted this article is the awesomely amazing folks on the Contributor Comms team saying, “I need to squash my commits and push that. ” Which immediately made me remember the wonder of the Tide label: tide/merge-method-squash. Contributing to Kubernetes will, most of the time, involve some kind of git-based action, specifically on the Kubernetes GitHub. This can be an obstacle to those less exposed to git and/or GitHub, and is especially noticeable when we’re dealing with non-code contributions (documentation, blog posts, etc. ). When a contributor submits something, it will generally be through a pull request. When it comes to how the change will go from request to approval, there are a number of considerations that must be made, such as: These are some of the main tasks in which Tide will help, allowing us to use the GitHub interface for these tasks (and more), making the actions more visible to the community (since they are visible as plain comments in the GitHub discussion), and allowing us to manage contributions without necessarily having to clone git repositories or having to manually issue git commands.</description></item><item><title>Blog: GSoC 2022 Final Report: Building Jenkins X UI</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2022-11-13-blog-gsoc-2022-final-report-building-jenkins-x-ui/</link><pubDate>Sun, 13 Nov 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2022-11-13-blog-gsoc-2022-final-report-building-jenkins-x-ui/</guid><description>It is a web application built with Golang for the backend and Sveltekit for the frontend, both of which are built together and used in the same container.

Securing the software supply chain encompasses vulnerability remediation and the implementation of controls throughout the software development process. Due to massive increase in attacks on software supply chain and the diversity of its types , Jenkins X has to make efforts to ensure that the build process is secure. As part of securing Jenkins X installation by default I worked on both securing our own components and enabling our users to use these features in their build and release steps. The work done so far covers these four sections. Description: A first step towards securing Jenkins X supply chain is to increase the amount of information gained from running jx version command. Implementation The issue created for this task is here. The PR to fix it is here. Description: As Jenkins X uses tekton as its pipeline execution engine, TaskRun and PipelineRun are considered the key components of Jenkins X pipeline activities and steps Tekton Chains monitors the execution of all TaskRun and PipelineRun inside the cluster and takes a snapshot upon completion of each of them to sign with user-provided cryptographic keys and store them on the backend storage. The payload and signature cn be verified later using cosign verify-blob. Implementation I used the helm chart developed by Chainguard for integrating Chains with Jenkins X. To integrate the chart and added support for it on jx3-versions to make installation of helm chart easy for our users.</description></item><item><title>Blog: Hacktoberfest 2022</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2022-10-03-blog-hacktoberfest-2022/</link><pubDate>Mon, 03 Oct 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2022-10-03-blog-hacktoberfest-2022/</guid><description>We are excited to announce that Jenkins X will be participating in Hacktoberfest again this year!

This blog will cover how we implemented this feature. An auto-refreshing CVE feed allows users and implementers to programmatically fetch the list of CVEs announced by the Kubernetes SRC (Security Response Committee). To ensure freshness and minimal maintainer overhead, the feed updates automatically by fetching the CVE related information from the CVE announcement GitHub Issues. Creating these issues is already part of the existing Security Response Committee (SRC) workflow. Until December 2021, it was not possible to filter for issues or PRs that are tied to CVEs announced by Kubernetes SRC. We added a new label, official-cve-feed to address that, and SIG-Security labelled relevant issues with it. The in-scope issues are closed issues for which there is a CVE ID(s) and is officially announced as a Kubernetes security vulnerability by SRC. You can now filter on all of these issues and find them here. For future security vulnerabilities, we added the label to the SRC playbook so that all the future in-scope issues will automatically have this label. For the next step, we created a prow job in order to periodically query the GitHub REST API and pull the relevant issues.</description></item><item><title>Blog: Enhancements Opt-in Process Change for v1.26</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2022-09-09-blog-enhancements-opt-in-process-change-for-v1-26/</link><pubDate>Fri, 09 Sep 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2022-09-09-blog-enhancements-opt-in-process-change-for-v1-26/</guid><description>Author: Grace Nguyen Since the inception of the Kubernetes release team, we have used a spreadsheet to keep track of enhancements for the release. The project has scaled massively in the past few years, with almost a hundred enhancements collected for the 1. 24 release. This process has become error-prone and time consuming. A lot of manual work is required from the release team and the SIG leads to populate KEPs data in the sheet. We have received continuous feedback from our contributors to streamline the process. Starting with the 1. 26 release, we are replacing the enhancements tracking spreadsheet with an automated GitHub project board. The board is populated with a script gathering all KEP issues in the kubernetes/enhancements repo that have the label lead-opted-in. The enhancements’ stage and SIG information will also be automatically pulled from the KEP issue. After the KEP is populated on the Github Project Board, the Enhancements team will manually update the KEP with the label tracked/yes , tracked/no and on occasions, tracked/out-of-tree. The tracked label signifies qualification for the closest approaching milestone.</description></item><item><title>Blog: Spotlight on SIG Storage</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2022-08-22-blog-spotlight-on-sig-storage/</link><pubDate>Mon, 22 Aug 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2022-08-22-blog-spotlight-on-sig-storage/</guid><description>Since the very beginning of Kubernetes, the topic of persistent data and how to address the requirement of stateful applications has been an important topic. Support for stateless deployments was natural, present from the start, and garnered attention, becoming very well-known. Work on better support for stateful applications was also present from early on, with each release increasing the scope of what could be run on Kubernetes. Message queues, databases, clustered filesystems: these are some examples of the solutions that have different storage requirements and that are, today, increasingly deployed in Kubernetes. Dealing with ephemeral and persistent storage, local or remote, file or block, from many different vendors, while considering how to provide the needed resiliency and data consistency that users expect, all of this is under SIG Storage’s umbrella. In this SIG Storage spotlight, Frederico Muñoz (Cloud &amp;amp; Architecture Lead at SAS) talked with Xing Yang , Tech Lead at VMware and co-chair of SIG Storage, on how the SIG is organized, what are the current challenges and how anyone can get involved and contribute.

This post features four outstanding contributors from China, who have played diverse leadership and community roles in the upstream Kubernetes project. So, without further ado, let’s get straight to the article. Andy Zhang currently works for Microsoft China at the Shanghai site. His main focus is on Kubernetes storage drivers. Andy started contributing to Kubernetes about 5 years ago. He states that as he is working in Azure Kubernetes Service team and spends most of his time contributing to the Kubernetes community project. Now he is the main contributor of quite a lot Kubernetes subprojects such as Kubernetes cloud provider code. His open source contributions are mainly self-motivated. In the last two years he has mentored a few students contributing to Kubernetes through the LFX Mentorship program, some of whom got jobs due to their expertise and contributions on Kubernetes projects. Andy is an active member of the China Kubernetes community. He adds that the Kubernetes community has a good guide about how to become members, code reviewers, approvers and finally when he found out that some open source projects are in the very early stage, he actively contributed to those projects and became the project maintainer.</description></item><item><title>Blog: Enhancing Kubernetes one KEP at a Time</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2022-08-11-blog-enhancing-kubernetes-one-kep-at-a-time/</link><pubDate>Thu, 11 Aug 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2022-08-11-blog-enhancing-kubernetes-one-kep-at-a-time/</guid><description>Author: Ryler Hockenbury (Mastercard) Did you know that Kubernetes v1. 24 has 46 enhancements ? That’s a lot of new functionality packed into a 4-month release cycle. The Kubernetes release team coordinates the logistics of the release, from remediating test flakes to publishing updated docs. It’s a ton of work, but they always deliver. The release team comprises around 30 people across six subteams - Bug Triage, CI Signal, Enhancements, Release Notes, Communications, and Docs. Each of these subteams manages a component of the release. This post will focus on the role of the enhancements subteam and how you can get involved. Great question. We’ll get to that in a second but first, let’s talk about how features are managed in Kubernetes. Each new feature requires a Kubernetes Enhancement Proposal - KEP for short. KEPs are small structured design documents that provide a way to propose and coordinate new features. The KEP author describes the motivation, design (and alternatives), risks, and tests - then community members provide feedback to build consensus.</description></item><item><title>Blog: Spotlight on SIG Docs</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2022-08-02-blog-spotlight-on-sig-docs/</link><pubDate>Tue, 02 Aug 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2022-08-02-blog-spotlight-on-sig-docs/</guid><description>Author: Purneswar Prasad The official documentation is the go-to source for any open source project. For Kubernetes, it’s an ever-evolving Special Interest Group (SIG) with people constantly putting in their efforts to make details about the project easier to consume for new contributors and users. SIG Docs publishes the official documentation on kubernetes. io which includes, but is not limited to, documentation of the core APIs, core architectural details, and CLI tools shipped with the Kubernetes release. To learn more about the work of SIG Docs and its future ahead in shaping the community, I have summarised my conversation with the co-chairs, Divya Mohan (DM), Rey Lejano (RL) and Natali Vlatko (NV), who ran through the SIG’s goals and how fellow contributors can help. SIG Docs is the special interest group for documentation for the Kubernetes project on kubernetes. io, generating reference guides for the Kubernetes API, kubeadm and kubectl as well as maintaining the official website’s infrastructure and analytics. The remit of their work also extends to docs releases, translation of docs, improvement and adding new features to existing documentation, pushing and reviewing content for the official Kubernetes blog and engaging with the Release Team for each cycle to get docs and blogs reviewed. Blogs : This subproject highlights new or graduated Kubernetes enhancements, community reports, SIG updates or any relevant news to the Kubernetes community such as thought leadership, tutorials and project updates, such as the Dockershim removal and removal of PodSecurityPolicy, which is upcoming in the 1. 25 release. Tim Bannister, one of the SIG Docs tech leads, does awesome work and is a major force when pushing contributions through to the docs and blogs. Localization : With this subproject, the Kubernetes community has been able to achieve greater inclusivity and diversity among both users and contributors.</description></item><item><title>Blog: Introduction to Software Bill Of Materials</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2022-07-24-blog-introduction-to-software-bill-of-materials/</link><pubDate>Sun, 24 Jul 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2022-07-24-blog-introduction-to-software-bill-of-materials/</guid><description>Before going through Software Bill Of Materials (SBOMs), we need to set the ground for a rising concern in the software industry which is Software Supply Chain Security. Like traditional industries, deploying a piece of a software artifact goes through multiple stages composed of collecting source code components, libraries, tools, and processes used in those stages. Fig. 1 https://blog. convisoappsec. com/en/is-your-software-supply-chain-secure/ A supply chain attack can occur along the chain from submitting unauthorized malicious code in your source, unauthorized injection of harmful dependencies, and even replacing packages after being built with other compromised artifacts. A more detailed explanation about those types of attacks is here Due to its importance and being a critical issue, generating SBOM for your software adds another layer of protection to this threat. As far as we know, developers around the world are building web applications using hundreds of third-party open-source libraries and packages. You can confidently tell that 90% of the software products around the world are built over open-source components. With that in mind, we need to keep track of using these dependencies while building our applications. What if there are vulnerabilities in the libraries we use? How to efficiently protect ourselves against it?.

Three commonly used standards achieved the NTIA minimum requirements for SBOM generation and each one results in a different final SBOM document. History: SPDX is an open-source machine-readable format adopted by the Linux Foundation as an industry standard. The specifications are implemented as a file format that identifies the software components within a larger piece of computer software and fulfilling the requirements of NTIA. The SPDX project started in 2010 and was initially dedicated to solving the issues around open source licensing compliance. It evolved over the years to adhere supply chain security challenges and has seen extensive uptake by companies and projects in the software industry. Companies like Hitachi, Fujitsu, and Toshiba contributed to furthering the standard in the SPDX v2. 2. 2 specification release.</description></item><item><title>Blog: Software Bill Of Materials generation tools</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2022-07-24-blog-software-bill-of-materials-generation-tools/</link><pubDate>Sun, 24 Jul 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2022-07-24-blog-software-bill-of-materials-generation-tools/</guid><description>Before you read this, you have to understand what are SBOMs and what are different formats of SBOMs If you got this far, you already realize the importance of SBOM generation, and also it should meet certain requirements to achieve its purpose. Due to various requirements depending on what standard you’re following, there has to be a way to automatically generate different output formats for different standards. Also, it has to be suited for ci/cd solutions to keep up with the increasing number of releases for each organization. Note: Here we’re only considering open source tools Introduction: Anchore is a platform that implements sbom-powered supply chain security solutions for developers and enterprises. For generating SBOMs, a CLI tool and library named Syft was developed by Anchore that could be injected into your ci/cd pipeline to generate SBOMs from container images and filesystems at each step. Integration and Support: Syft is supported on Linux, Mac, and Windows and it can run as a docker container which makes it a great suit for CI systems. Other than the 3 SBOM standards, Syft can generate its JSON standard format to be input for other Anchore tools like Grype which is a vulnerability scanner for container images and filesystems. It supports projects based on the following package managers: Features and Specs: For more resources about Syft capabilities refer to the source repo and official documentation Introduction: Opensbom-Generator is an open source project initiated by the Linux Foundation SPDX workgroup to generate SBOMs using CLI tools. Currently, they support the standard spdx 2. 2 formats and JSON with their spdx-sbom-generator tool based on golang.

In 2022, I have been selected as a student developer in Google Summer of Code under Jenkins X. We will be building a new UI for Jenkins X. I got this news on May 20th, as I received an email from google. The technologies needed were Golang , Kubernetes , and GitOps. I used golang only once before, while linting Jenkins X codebase, I only used Kubernetes once before while setting up a k3s cluster to run Jenkins X pipelines. These tasks were necessary to do for all GSoC participants. Apart from that, I was a total beginner. So, when I got selected, I had a lot to learn, my mentors gave me a 30 Day plan. They also suggested some resources and conference talks which made it simple for me to start. 30 Day plan was: We also had some amazing pair programming sessions, where I used to share my screen and my mentor guided me through, which is not common because mentors have a very busy schedule. But my mentors helped me a lot.</description></item><item><title>Blog: Contextual Logging in Kubernetes 1.24</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2022-05-25-blog-contextual-logging-in-kubernetes-1-24/</link><pubDate>Wed, 25 May 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2022-05-25-blog-contextual-logging-in-kubernetes-1-24/</guid><description>Authors: Patrick Ohly (Intel) The Structured Logging Working Group has added new capabilities to the logging infrastructure in Kubernetes 1. 24. This blog post explains how developers can take advantage of those to make log output more useful and how they can get involved with improving Kubernetes. The goal of structured logging is to replace C-style formatting and the resulting opaque log strings with log entries that have a well-defined syntax for storing message and parameters separately, for example as a JSON struct. When using the traditional klog text output format for structured log calls, strings were originally printed with \n escape sequences, except when embedded inside a struct. For structs, log entries could still span multiple lines, with no clean way to split the log stream into individual entries: Now, the &amp;lt; and &amp;gt; markers along with indentation are used to ensure that splitting at a klog header at the start of a line is reliable and the resulting output is human-readable: Note that the log message itself is printed with quoting. It is meant to be a fixed string that identifies a log entry, so newlines should be avoided there. Before Kubernetes 1. 24, some log calls in kube-scheduler still used klog. Info for multi-line strings to avoid the unreadable output. Now all log calls have been updated to support structured logging. Contextual logging is based on the go-logr API.</description></item><item><title>Blog: February 2022 Community Meeting Highlights</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2022-05-05-blog-february-2022-community-meeting-highlights/</link><pubDate>Thu, 05 May 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2022-05-05-blog-february-2022-community-meeting-highlights/</guid><description>Author: Nigel Brown (VMware) We just had our first contributor community meeting this year, and it was awesome to be back with you in that format. These meetings will be happening on Zoom once per month, on the third Thursday of the month - that should be available in your calendar if you’re subscribed to the k-dev mailing list. Community meetings are an opportunity for you to meet synchronously with other members of the Kubernetes community to talk about issues of general appeal. This meeting kicked off with an update on the 1. 24 release with Xander Grzywinski, who is one of the shadows for the release team leads. This release is scheduled for April 19, 2022 with a code freeze scheduled for March 30th. At the time of the meeting there were 66 individual enhancements included, as well as bug fixes. You can join the conversation on Slack in #sig-release. Update: Kubernetes 1. 24 was delayed and released on May 3, 2022. From there, the discussion moved to the dockershim removal and the docs updates we need to make around that, with the discussion led by Kat Cosgrove. The main takeaway was that if you have a platform, talk to folks about this change.</description></item><item><title>Blog: Kubernetes 1.22 - Breaking change!</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2022-04-22-blog-kubernetes-1-22-breaking-change/</link><pubDate>Fri, 22 Apr 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2022-04-22-blog-kubernetes-1-22-breaking-change/</guid><description>To allow Jenkins X to support Kubernetes 1. 22, we had to update our version of Tekton. This updated version of Tekton contains breaking changes that has consequences if you made your own custom Jenkins X pipelines. To make sure that your custom pipelines continue to work after this upgrade, you must edit the resource settings in your pipelines. Otherwise your pipelines will most likely not be able to start at all, or if they do, consume a lot of resources. Tekton made changes in how to calculate the resources needed to run a pipeline, in order to support the concept of LimitRange in Kubernetes (introduced in Kubernetes version 1. 10). Previously, Tekton simply used the maximum requested cpu and memory of any single step, and set that as limits for the all steps in the pipeline. For more details, please read the Tekton documentation on LimitRange. In the Tekton pipeline files, the StepTemplate needs to be changed to not specify resource requests , but only setting an empty resource limits : The resource requests should be set on only one individual step: To see examples of what changes you need to apply to your custom pipelines you may investigate this PR on The Jenkins X pipeline catalog. The PR will be merged and released simultaneous with the upgrade of Tekton. In the current version of Tekton used by Jenkins X, the resource requests are set on the stepTemplate.</description></item><item><title>Blog: Google Summer of Code 2022 project proposal template ☀️</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2022-04-05-blog-google-summer-of-code-2022-project-proposal-template/</link><pubDate>Tue, 05 Apr 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2022-04-05-blog-google-summer-of-code-2022-project-proposal-template/</guid><description>Repeat this section for as many project ideas as you want (Go in the order most likely to least likely).</description></item><item><title>Blog: Project proposal for Google Season of Docs 2022 📄</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2022-03-23-blog-project-proposal-for-google-season-of-docs-2022/</link><pubDate>Wed, 23 Mar 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2022-03-23-blog-project-proposal-for-google-season-of-docs-2022/</guid><description>We have put together a project proposal as part of our application to participate in the Google Season of Docs 2022 program.

This article describes a workaround for a similar issue I encountered when attempting to have my modifications approved and merged into the master branch. While contributing to kubernetes/kubernetes for some minor documentation changes, the pushed changes needed to be updated with other verified contents of the entire documentation. So, in order for the change to take effect, a single command must be performed to ensure that all tests on the CI pipeline pass. The single command make update runs all presubmission verification tests. For some reason on the “Windows Subsystem for Linux” environment the tests, specifically the update-openapi-spec. sh script, failed (in my case, take a look at the conversation here ), eventually failing the pull-kubernetes-verify tests. You might encounter the following on your PR The tests failing the particular issue: Consecutively, Additionally one can check the failed test via the link provided under details in the above image.

This post will feature four outstanding contributors from the Australia and New Zealand regions, who have played diverse leadership and community roles in the Upstream Kubernetes project. So, without further ado, let’s get straight to the article. Caleb Woodbine is currently a member of the ii. nz organisation. He began contributing to the Kubernetes project in 2018 as a member of the Kubernetes Conformance working group. His experience was positive, and he benefited from early guidance from Hippie Hacker , a fellow contributor from New Zealand. He has made major contributions to Kubernetes project since then through SIG k8s-infra and k8s-conformance working group. Caleb is also a co-organizer of the CloudNative NZ community events, which aim to expand the reach of Kubernetes project throughout New Zealand in order to encourage technical education and improved employment opportunities. There need to be more outreach in APAC and the educators and universities must pick up Kubernetes, as they are very slow and about 8+ years out of date. NZ tends to rather pay overseas than educate locals on the latest cloud tech Locally. Dylan Graham is a cloud engineer from Adeliade, Australia.</description></item><item><title>Blog: Google Summer of Code 2022 ☀️</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2022-03-12-blog-google-summer-of-code-2022/</link><pubDate>Sat, 12 Mar 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2022-03-12-blog-google-summer-of-code-2022/</guid><description>We are very happy to announce that Jenkins X has been selected to participate in the Google Summer of Code (GSoC) 2022! If you are new to GSoC and want to learn more about it, check out their new site. You can find the list of project ideas from Jenkins X here. If you are interested in applying to Jenkins X, please check the timeline. Apply as early as possible. This post aims to give GSoC contributors insight into the selection process and how to get started. We have 3 mentors signed up at the moment and are looking to select a maximum of 2 applicants. We want you to have a great experience contributing to Jenkins X and learn lots of new things! You do not have to complete all of these tasks. This is presented here so that you have some clarity around where to start and which resources to follow. We will start interviewing candidates between April 19 and May 12. We want to talk to you individually, and get to know you better. Contributors will be scored based on the following criteria: Important: Nice to have: Technical expertise (basic knowledge goes a long way): Past open source contribution experience Any level of familiarity with Jenkins X (or other CI/CD tools) Complete one of the three tasks listed below (If you have any questions on these tasks, please ask in our slack channel and we’ll be happy to answer your questions): Previous GSoC experience (first time contributors are more than welcome) We will make an effort to talk individually to all the Jenkins X GSoC contributor applicants. We look forward to reviewing your application and working with you.</description></item><item><title>Blog: Project ideas for Google Summer of Code 2022 ☀️</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2022-02-20-blog-project-ideas-for-google-summer-of-code-2022/</link><pubDate>Sun, 20 Feb 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2022-02-20-blog-project-ideas-for-google-summer-of-code-2022/</guid><description>Jenkins X has been accepted into the Google Summer of Code 2022 program, take a look at the follow up blog. Project proposal template can be found here. We have put together some project ideas as part of our application to participate in the Google Summer of Code 2022 program. The only way to trigger jobs/workflows in Jenkins X at the moment is by listening to events from Source Control Management (SCM) providers like github, gitlab, bitbucket, however it would be nice to listen to other event sources and trigger jobs/pipelines in Jenkins X. One interesting application would be to trigger some Jenkins X job in response to some alerting event (pagerduty, opsgenie). As a start we should focus on (emitting and listening to) cloudevents which define a common format for events produced from different sources. This will also help make Jenkins X compatible with other platforms. Golang, kubernetes, cloudevents, familiarity with lighthouse would be great, but not required 350 hours Hard With all the software breach that has happened recently, it has become necessary to add tooling to solve the issue around supply chain security. There are some good open source tools which can help with that (sigstore tools). As a CI/CD platform, Jenkins X needs to be integrated with them so that the end users can get this feature out of the box. Jenkins X leverages tekton as it’s pipeline execution engine. However, we dont integrate with tekton chain yet.</description></item><item><title>Blog: SIG Node CI Subproject Celebrates Two Years of Test Improvements</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2022-02-16-blog-sig-node-ci-subproject-celebrates-two-years-of-test-improvements/</link><pubDate>Wed, 16 Feb 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2022-02-16-blog-sig-node-ci-subproject-celebrates-two-years-of-test-improvements/</guid><description>Authors: Sergey Kanzhelev (Google), Elana Hashman (Red Hat) Ensuring the reliability of SIG Node upstream code is a continuous effort that takes a lot of behind-the-scenes effort from many contributors. There are frequent releases of Kubernetes, base operating systems, container runtimes, and test infrastructure that result in a complex matrix that requires attention and steady investment to “keep the lights on. ” In May 2020, the Kubernetes node special interest group (“SIG Node”) organized a new subproject for continuous integration (CI) for node-related code and tests. Since its inauguration, the SIG Node CI subproject has run a weekly meeting, and even the full hour is often not enough to complete triage of all bugs, test-related PRs and issues, and discuss all related ongoing work within the subgroup. Over the past two years, we’ve fixed merge-blocking and release-blocking tests, reducing time to merge Kubernetes contributors’ pull requests thanks to reduced test flakes. When we started, Node test jobs only passed 42% of the time, and through our efforts, we now ensure a consistent &amp;gt;90% job pass rate. We’ve closed 144 test failure issues and merged 176 pull requests just in kubernetes/kubernetes. And we’ve helped subproject participants ascend the Kubernetes contributor ladder, with 3 new org members, 6 new reviewers, and 2 new approvers. The Node CI subproject is an approachable first stop to help new contributors get started with SIG Node. There is a low barrier to entry for new contributors to address high-impact bugs and test fixes, although there is a long road before contributors can climb the entire contributor ladder: it took over a year to establish two new approvers for the group. The complexity of all the different components that power Kubernetes nodes and its test infrastructure requires a sustained investment over a long period for developers to deeply understand the entire system, both at high and low levels of detail. We have several regular contributors at our meetings, however; our reviewers and approvers pool is still small.</description></item><item><title>Blog: Jenkins X Survey Result Details</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2022-02-15-blog-jenkins-x-survey-result-details/</link><pubDate>Tue, 15 Feb 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2022-02-15-blog-jenkins-x-survey-result-details/</guid><description>For more information on the Jenkins X survey see Survey results Some highlights from the free text answers. run it against a local running cluster to test changes to Jenkins-X before updated in GitHub. Integration with on-premise (Gitlab) as a lot of organizations are not using public cloud due to security policies, Proper guide on installing into existing cluster without using terraform. Give us back something like jx compliance , jx boot. Would be nice to not be tied to terraform to boot jenkins-x. Just like kubernetes, it would be great to have a jenkins-x the hard way where everything needs to be installed manually. it’s very difficult to just dive in without previous knowledge of the system extreme lack of quality documentation. Many conversations take place in slack and users cannot find information that somebody had the same problem beforehand and how it was solved More documentation and guides, making sure quickstart guides work without hassle Making it easier to get started Very hard to find any information on how people solve a similar problem before I very much enjoy your documentation, but it is very hard to find anything on google that is a huge disadvantage. Documents need to be clear about what works, and what does not work (kubernetes versions for example, bitbucket etc. ) Could also be nice with an arcitecture illustration or video that could compare jenkins with jenkins X I find that when I’m looking for information I get a lot of mixed results (v3 vs v2). Integration with vault is confused. Why install vault in docker in k3s environment? I strongly believe in this project!

We received lots of valuable insights into how people are using Jenkins X. We need more contributors in the Jenkins X community, so if you feel strongly about how Jenkins X should evolve, your best bet is to dive in and get your hands dirty:) Some highlights of the free text responses we got are collected here According to the survey, a typical Jenkinx X user works with Devops and Software Engineering This person is using Jenkins X version 3 on Amazon working in a company of 1-50 people. She finds it somewhat difficult to find documentation, average 2. 9 out of 5 The Jenkins X user tries to find information mainly on the main web site, sometimes on slack and less often on github. What he enjoys most about Jenkins X is that it is an easy way to learn, play around and work with Kubernetes. The git(ops(ish)) style of configuration, the preview environments, and the staging /production environments. But one thing is sure, documentation is confusing and shold be improved. The typical Jenkins X user would like to run Jenkins X offline, either to run on a laptop, or behind a (corporate) firewall. Proper support for multi-tenancy would be nice, and who can ignore security in these times. A clear governance of Jenkins X needs to be established, The typical person who answers surveys on Jenkins X is planning to attend Jenkins X Office hours, which is great! See you there next week then!.</description></item><item><title>Blog: Spotlight on SIG Multicluster</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2022-02-04-blog-spotlight-on-sig-multicluster/</link><pubDate>Fri, 04 Feb 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2022-02-04-blog-spotlight-on-sig-multicluster/</guid><description>Authors: Dewan Ahmed (Aiven) and Chris Short (AWS) SIG Multicluster is the Special Interest Group (SIG) focused on how Kubernetes concepts are expanded and used beyond the cluster boundary. Historically, Kubernetes resources only interacted within that boundary - KRU or Kubernetes Resource Universe (not an actual Kubernetes concept). Kubernetes clusters, even now, don’t really know anything about themselves or, about other clusters. Absence of cluster identifiers is a case in point. With the growing adoption of multicloud and multicluster deployments, the work SIG Multicluster doing is gaining a lot of attention. In this article, Jeremy Olmsted-Thompson, Google and Chris Short, AWS discuss the interesting problems SIG Multicluster is solving and how you can get involved. Their initials JOT and CS will be used for brevity. CS : How long has the SIG Multicluster existed and how was the SIG in its infancy? How long have you been with this SIG? JOT : I’ve been around for almost two years in the SIG Multicluster. All I know about the infancy years is from the lore but even in the early days, it was always about solving this same problem. Early efforts have been things like KubeFed. I think there are still folks using KubeFed but it’s a smaller slice. Back then, I think people out there deploying large numbers of Kubernetes clusters were really not at a point where we had a ton of real concrete use cases.</description></item><item><title>Blog: January 2022 updates from the JX community</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2022-02-02-blog-january-2022-updates-from-the-jx-community/</link><pubDate>Wed, 02 Feb 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2022-02-02-blog-january-2022-updates-from-the-jx-community/</guid><description>Happy new year 2022!

In this post, we’ll introduce you to five amazing folks from the India region who have been actively contributing to the upstream Kubernetes projects in a variety of ways, as well as being the leaders or maintainers of numerous community initiatives. 💫 Let’s get started, so without further ado… Arsh is currently employed with Okteto as a Developer Experience engineer. As a new contributor, he realised that 1:1 mentorship opportunities were quite beneficial in getting him started with the upstream project. He is presently a CI Signal shadow on the Kubernetes 1. 23 release team. He is also contributing to the SIG Testing and SIG Docs projects, as well as to the cert-manager tools development work that is being done under the aegis of SIG Architecture. To the newcomers, Arsh helps plan their early contributions sustainably. I would encourage folks to contribute in a way that’s sustainable. What I mean by that is that it’s easy to be very enthusiastic early on and take up more stuff than one can actually handle. This can often lead to burnout in later stages. It’s much more sustainable to work on things iteratively.</description></item><item><title>Blog: Incident: Kaniko and ACR</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2021-12-28-blog-incident-kaniko-and-acr/</link><pubDate>Tue, 28 Dec 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2021-12-28-blog-incident-kaniko-and-acr/</guid><description>We’ve recently had an issue with one of our packages come to light. We wanted to talk through the resolution steps we’re going to put into place. Azure users started reporting seeing the following error within the build step: This seemed to be indicating to an authorization issues with the terraform module. Other users were seemingly unaffected by this issue. Upon further analysis, kaniko seems to have issues with the latest version and grabbing credentials for acr. The latest working version that we are aware of is 1. 3. There wasn’t a massive influx of people seeing this issue due to it only occuring once versionstream had been updated with jx gitops upgrade. For starters, most users are probably using the latest kaniko features, so we’re unable to just roll this back for everyone. We’re getting started by creating a PR to kaniko to resolve the issue. However, due to release schedules etc, this will mean that getting started with azure will be broken for quite a while.

Like last year, this year also we are back with Kubernetes Contributor Celebration, the annual end of the year celebration, to recognize our achievements and have some fun! It’s a time for us to relax, chat and do something fun with your fellow contributors! To register, please fill out the Registration Form. More details on how to join the event. DevOps Party Games “DevOps Party Games takes the idea of “online party games” and tilts it on its head by adding DevOps-inspired content to existing games, and then streams it live via Twitch for a worldwide audience to watch, comment, and hopefully be entertained. In addition, the hosts (Matt Stratton, Jeremy Meiss, and Dan Maher) will provide color commentary, much like a modern day Cotton McKnight and Pepper Brooks (announcers from Dodgeball). ” There will be a Kubernetes slant for this edition of DevOps Party Games. The Great Cloud Native Bakeoff A virtual cooking event styled after the Great British Bake-off will be held during the Kubernetes Celebration Event. Contestants will have 90 minutes to bake something related to to your Cloud Native experience. Anything goes, as long as the majority of preparation is done live. The competition is open to all skill levels, from baking from a cake mix to grinding your own flour as long as it’s somehow Kubernetes-themed. At the end of the contest, each baked good will be judged on ambition, execution, success, and implementation of a Kubernetes theme. The winner will get a unique, handmade, baking-related prize. We’re looking for cooks of all backgrounds and talents.</description></item><item><title>Blog: Improve your documentation with Mermaid.js diagrams</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2021-12-01-blog-improve-your-documentation-with-mermaid-js-diagrams/</link><pubDate>Wed, 01 Dec 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2021-12-01-blog-improve-your-documentation-with-mermaid-js-diagrams/</guid><description>By Chris Metz and Tim Bannister Topics covered in this blog.

This will mainly affect jx v2 users but there is expected to be a small impact on v3 users too. Below describes the steps we believe are needed to keep Jenkins X installations working as normal but there will be some action needed. When Jenkins X first started we made heavy use of GCP’s services for hosting the cloud infrastructure needed by users to install and run Jenkins X. This was great as we could use the same IAM to push and maintain content from our own hosted build infrastructure and ensure we were validating the same experience of using cloud provider hosted services wherever possible. As Jenkins X grew in popularity the cloud costs began to increase with the pricing model from GCP , specifically the networking costs of cross continent egress. Given this, for jx3 we decided to see if switching to GitHub packages for container images and GitHub pages for helm repositories would be better, the result was it is better. In fact we have made it super easy for users to switch to using GitHub pages for releasing helm charts and using GitHub packages. Now that we have validated GitHub is more cost effective for hosting public images and helm charts for the Jenkins X project, we want to switch to using GitHub for all v2 plus v3 users, then shutdown the GCP services which are causing unnecessary cost. It is expected that v3 users will need a small change and v2 slightly more. Details for both will be described below but it is worth noting that there hasn’t been a v2 release in 9 months and v3 was GA in April earlier this year, so we aren’t expecting too many folks on v2. We are aiming to limit any disruption and help provide easy steps to handle the move.</description></item><item><title>Blog: How to debug your Tekton pipelines</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2021-08-18-blog-how-to-debug-your-tekton-pipelines/</link><pubDate>Wed, 18 Aug 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2021-08-18-blog-how-to-debug-your-tekton-pipelines/</guid><description>Tekton recently introduced a debug feature when you create TaskRun resources so that steps can be paused at a breakpoint until told to move forwards so that you can diagnose why pipeline steps fail. The latest Tekton release only supports breakpoints on TaskRun resources but there is a Pull Request #4145 to add support also to debugging PipelineRun resources as well. If you are reading this please add your thumbs up emoji feedback to the PR #4145 We’ve switched Jenkins X to use a preview image of Tekton with PR #4145 included so that Jenkins X developers can easily debug their pipelines (which typically are PipelineRun resources). Here is a demo which shows how to debug pipelines: Make sure your cluster is upgraded to the latest version stream. If you intend to use the jx in the below examples make sure you upgrade the CLI too To enable a breakpoint you can: You can view breakpoints in the Lens UI in the Breakpoints tab or via: Once you have set a breakpoint defined for a particular Pipeline you need to trigger the pipeline. e. g. perform a git commit on the git branch to trigger a new pipeline to execute. The pipeline will execute as normal; you’ll be able to view it execute via: Once your breakpoint is reached the pipeline pod will pause, waiting to continue. At this point you can then open a shell inside the container. The easiest way to do this is via the Lens UI , click on the Pipeline action menu then Shell -&amp;gt; latest step and a shell will open. Otherwise you can use: If you wish to continue the execution of a pipeline there are multiple scripts you can run inside the shell you can run inside the shell in the pipeline to tell the pipeline to continue: There are a few ways to delete breakpoints.</description></item><item><title>Blog: How to use GitOps and Kubernetes External Secrets for better audit and security</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2021-08-17-blog-how-to-use-gitops-and-kubernetes-external-secrets-for-better-audit-and-secu/</link><pubDate>Tue, 17 Aug 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2021-08-17-blog-how-to-use-gitops-and-kubernetes-external-secrets-for-better-audit-and-secu/</guid><description>So GitOps is a cool approach to managing kubernetes resources in a cluster, by checking in the source code for: Then everything is versioned and audited; you know who changed what, when and why. If a change breaks things, just revert via git like any other source code change. You can then add pipelines to verify changes in the Pull Requests result in valid kubernetes YAML etc. Then if you merge changes to git then an operator detect the change and do the kubectl apply (or helm install or whatever). There are a number of tools out there for doing this. e. g. Anthos Config Management , argo cd , fleet , flux cd and kapp controller So why did Jenkins X not use these tools and instead created its own git operator ? Over time it would be great to have more standardisation of the Git layout given the different tool. Our current recommended layout that works with many GitOps tools is described here. A number of solutions in the GitOps space define which helm charts to install in git with configuration files; or specify which kustomize templates to apply etc. However Jenkins X defaults to using helmfile to manage installing, upgrading and configuring multiple helm charts. Then we use helmfile template to render the helm charts as kubernetes resources.</description></item><item><title>Blog: How to choose a SIG as a non-code Kubernetes contributor</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2021-07-09-blog-how-to-choose-a-sig-as-a-non-code-kubernetes-contributor/</link><pubDate>Fri, 09 Jul 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2021-07-09-blog-how-to-choose-a-sig-as-a-non-code-kubernetes-contributor/</guid><description>By Chris Short Kubernetes contributors aren’t people in capes or part of some secret society. How to start committing to the GitHub repos that make up the project is well documented , yet it remains intimidating for many. A few years ago, I spoke at an event and jokingly said, “Kubernetes is just a bunch of APIs and YAML… I’m a contributor; you don’t believe me?” After that talk, someone pulled me aside and asked if I was the Kubernetes contributor. They wanted to get involved in the community. Then came the real question, “I don’t know which special interest group (SIG) I would work in. ” The SIG you work in depends on your skills and what you want to do with your (or your company’s) free time. I’ll start with myself as an example. I do not code as part of my day-to-day work; I never have. While I have made bits of code into programs here and there, I always had a helping hand. It’s also possible my definition of a coder is busted too. But, I consider myself a non-code contributor to Kubernetes. I’m an Ops person that embraced DevOps early.</description></item><item><title>Blog: Jenkins X 3 and Argo CD</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2021-06-28-blog-jenkins-x-3-and-argo-cd/</link><pubDate>Mon, 28 Jun 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2021-06-28-blog-jenkins-x-3-and-argo-cd/</guid><description>There have been a number of requests from the Jenkins X community to use Argo CD for the last mile deployment phase of their continuous delivery pipelines. This blog explains some of the advantages of using Jenkins X and Argo CD all together. What’s included? You might be wondering why you would want to use BOTH Jenkins X and Argo CD together. Jenkins X aims to embrace OSS, where possible providing a nice UX to integrate with other projects and help provide better solutions for building, developing and running software on Kubernetes. Jenkins X indeed does have a git operator that applies Kubernetes YAML from a Git repository but there are some differences: Jenkins X uses GitOps principles for the entire installation, i. e. the starting point is a Git repository which is used to provision a cluster and manage (automatic if users wish) upgrades whereas today Argo CD uses a manual kubectl apply to manage the Argo installation itself. External Secrets integration for Vault, Google Secrets manager etc is something that Jenkins X provides out of the box. When Kubernetes based applications require a secret we prefer the source is stored in a secrets manager and the value synchronised automatically into the cluster enabling easier secret rotation, avoiding local secrets on machines and an easier UX for working with secrets. When adding an Application via Argo CD users can leverage the Jenkins X approach to working with secrets and rely on Argo to manage the deployments. If users prefer to work with SOPS that is totally fine too and will work in the same way as they are used to. If you do not wish to expose direct access for the Kubernetes cluster to developers then using a combination of Jenkins X UI for accessing logs and Argo CD for managing application deployments may be enough.</description></item><item><title>Blog: Continuous microservices with databases in Jenkins X</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2021-06-25-blog-continuous-microservices-with-databases-in-jenkins-x/</link><pubDate>Fri, 25 Jun 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2021-06-25-blog-continuous-microservices-with-databases-in-jenkins-x/</guid><description>A common question we get asked on the Jenkins X project is how to get started creating microservices that use databases with automated CI/CD with GitOps Promotion and Preview Environments. To make things a little easier to get started we’ve created a new node-postgresql quickstart. If you are using the cloud then we prefer cloud over kubernetes for things like databases, storage, ingress and secret managers so please try use your clouds managed databases if you can. So ideally you’d set up your database via your infrastructure as code solution, such as terraform , and then associate your kubernetes Service Account to a cloud IAM role to access the database. However to provide something simple that just works in any kubernetes cluster this quickstart uses the postgres-operator to manage setting up each database cluster in each environment. So to be able to use this quickstart you will need to install this operator into your cluster. You can add charts to your cluster via the CLI. From inside a git clone of your cluster git repository run the following command: This will modify the helmfile. yaml to point at a new helmfiles/postgres/helmfile. yaml file to deploy the postgres-operator chart. Then git commit and push that change to your cluster. You can watch it run via jx admin log -w.</description></item><item><title>Blog: Jenkins X at cdCon</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2021-06-22-blog-jenkins-x-at-cdcon/</link><pubDate>Tue, 22 Jun 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2021-06-22-blog-jenkins-x-at-cdcon/</guid><description>cdCon 2021 is about to start with lots of great sessions.

If so we recommend not to use docker on your laptop. Docker on Windows/MacOS helps you run a VM that can then run linux containers easily. But why bother? We highly recommend just use a development kubernetes cluster - build and run your containers there instead then you’re closer to a production like environment. First you’ll need a kubernetes cluster. I fully agree with James Ward that developers should not need to run kubernetes. Friends don’t let friends setup and manage kubernetes clusters by hand :). So try ask your infrastructure team for a development cluster or, if you can, use the cloud to set-up a managed kubernetes cluster. All the public clouds have a relatively straightforward way to spin up a fully managed kubernetes cluster for you that will be relatively inexpensive &amp;amp; they are easy to scale down when you don’t need them. e. g. on Google Cloud it’s a couple of clicks and about 5 minutes later you’ll have a fully managed kubernetes cluster ready to use. Its easy to enable auto-scaling too.</description></item><item><title>Blog: Jenkins X 3 - May 2021 LTS</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2021-05-12-blog-jenkins-x-3-may-2021-lts/</link><pubDate>Wed, 12 May 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2021-05-12-blog-jenkins-x-3-may-2021-lts/</guid><description>May 2001 LTS release is now available!

We have also been continuously delivering changes from Jenkins X into our production cluster for many months now and it’s been working great - GitOps FTW! In general Jenkins X 3. x is now much simpler and more flexible. It supports lots more platforms than before and should be easy to extend and configure for other platforms too. If you have never tried 3. x before then please follow the Admin Guide to get Jenkins X installed on your cloud provider, on-premises kubernetes cluster or minikube. If you previously tried the 3. x alpha then the migration instructions are here.

LTS is a slower cadence version stream which contains a verified set of releases and configurations that have been used by teams tracking the bleeding edge Jenkins X. Initially when we decided to maintain an LTS version stream we thought we’d aim for monthly releases however this second release comes two months after the first. This has given us more chances to run fixes and chart upgrades on Jenkins X own infrastructure to verify stability. Note This LTS release is intended to be the final one before Jenkins X 3 is made Generally Available so stay tuned for the exciting news coming very soon! We will of course continue to develop and release LTS post GA.

And the first one is tracing for all your pipelines : With it, you can easily see the timings of all your pipelines, stages, and steps. This is great to inspect a “slow” pipeline and quickly see the slower steps. We are using OpenTelemetry to generate a “logical” view of the pipeline, with 1 trace per pipeline and 1 span for each stage and step. By default, these traces are ingested by Grafana Tempo. But if you prefer to export them to a different destination, it’s very easy, and thanks to the OpenTelemetry Collector you can export to a lot of different services. You can see the full list here and here. The trace identifier is also stored in the pipeline itself so that the Jenkins X Pipelines Visualizer UI can link directly to the trace. You just need to enable the observability stack, as explained in the observability admin guide. Then, trigger a pipeline, and once it’s finished, go to the web UI, and click on the “Trace” button on the top-right. That’s it! This is only the first step of native tracing support in Jenkins X. Stay tuned for more!.</description></item><item><title>Blog: Jenkins X v3: now with built-in observability</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2021-04-01-blog-jenkins-x-v3-now-with-built-in-observability/</link><pubDate>Thu, 01 Apr 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2021-04-01-blog-jenkins-x-v3-now-with-built-in-observability/</guid><description>As a Continuous Delivery platform, Jenkins X has a central part in your infrastructure. If it becomes unstable or unusable, it will impact the whole software delivery of your organization. This is why observability is a critical topic for Jenkins X, and work has started to get observability built-in for Jenkins X v3: We’re using Grafana as the central visualization component: the main entry point from which you can get a complete overview of both your application’s lifecycle - development, build, tests, releases, deployments, runtime - and your Continuous Delivery platform. Platform observability is not enabled by default for the moment, so the first step is to enable it, as explained in the platform observability admin guide. Once it’s done, you’ll get a running Grafana instance, pre-configured with data sources for applications logs - using Loki - and applications metrics - using Prometheus. But most important, it comes with a set of pre-defined Grafana dashboards for the main platform components: Tekton, Lighthouse, cert-manager, … Here is an example of such a dashboard, using a mix of data sources to display cert-manager metrics collected by Prometheus - including the certificates expiration dates - and logs collected by Loki/Promtail: Continuous Delivery Indicators’ main goal is to give people insights into their workflows/processes so that they can continuously improve them. This is based on the DORA devops metrics and the SPACE framework. The CD Indicators addon is not enabled by default for the moment, so the first step is to enable it, as explained in the continuous delivery indicators admin guide. Once it’s done, you’ll get a running collector, along with a PostgreSQL database. The collector will listen for various events, both from the cluster and the git repositories, and store pull requests, pipelines, releases, and deployments data in the PostgreSQL database. The addon will also expose a new Grafana data source along with pre-configured Grafana dashboards, which will be picked up by your running Grafana instance. Here is an example of such a dashboard, displaying various indicators for a single repository/application: contributors, reviews, pull requests, releases, deployments, … This is only the beginning!

You can then use this preview environment to run integration tests, or manually use/test your application. This is all great until you have more and more applications, each with a few dependencies (postgresql, mongodb, …) and a few opened pull requests at any time. This means that you’ll get more and more pods running in your Kubernetes cluster, in addition to Jenkins X’s own components, your build pipelines, and of course your staging and production applications - unless you are using multi-cluster. The result is that you’ll need more nodes or bigger nodes. Which means more money. But, these preview environments are in fact idle most of the time: they are only used for the integration tests, and sometimes when someone manually uses them. The rest of the time - including all night for example - they are just staying there, idle, and consuming resources. What if we could easily scale them down when they are idle, and automatically bring them up when we need them? So that a Pull Request staying opened for 2 weeks because someone went on vacation won’t consume resources in your cluster. Enter Osiris ! Initially created by the Deislabs team , Osiris is a Kubernetes component that will automatically scale down your “idle” pods, and scale them up when a request comes in. Although the original project has been archived, the Dailymotion team has taken over the maintenance of a fork. And they have been using it with success in their Jenkins X dev cluster for more than 2 years: they regularly have around 50 preview environments active at any time, and… 0 pods from these environments running at night - or on weekends.</description></item><item><title>Blog: cdCon 2021 - Call for Jenkins X Proposals</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2021-02-25-blog-cdcon-2021-call-for-jenkins-x-proposals/</link><pubDate>Thu, 25 Feb 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2021-02-25-blog-cdcon-2021-call-for-jenkins-x-proposals/</guid><description>Hear ye!

We are moving towards a microservice kind of world with many teams writing many bits of software in many repositories. So there are lots and lots of pipelines. These pipelines keep getting more sophisticated over time; doing much more (all kinds of building, analysis, reporting, testing, ChatOps etc) and the software/images/approaches they use change. So how can we manage, configure and maintain them all so that there are many pipelines for many repositories; where each repository can customise anything it needs but we can easily maintain everything continuously and its easy to understand and tool around? We’ve tried to tackle this problem in a number of ways over the years; each has pros and cons. One option is to put all your pipelines in a shared library. You can then reference the pipelines by name in each of your repositories. But what if you want to change a bit of a pipeline for a specific repository? If you change it globally for everyone you can break things. You may just want local customisation for your repository only. You can add parameters into your pipelines. They are quite verbose on Pipelines and PipelineRuns ; but it’s hard to think up front of every parameterisation that may be required by downstream repositories. e.</description></item><item><title>Blog: Jenkins X 3 - February 2021 LTS</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2021-02-01-blog-jenkins-x-3-february-2021-lts/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Feb 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2021-02-01-blog-jenkins-x-3-february-2021-lts/</guid><description>This is the first LTS release for Jenkins X 3. x.

To kick this off we are going to start with 9 videos that we’ll follow up with more dedicated blogs over the coming weeks. The complete playlist can be found here however the blog below gives a more context for each one. There are a few key areas we are focusing on here: Starting off with a very quick introduction including what to expect from the walkthrough series. Jenkins X 3. x has focussed on clearer lines of separation, making the architecture significantly more pluggable, extensible and maintainable. With better tooling including UIs and more reliable guard rails for installations and upgrades. Jenkins X 3 also minimises abstractions and wrapping; so it promotes the direct use of open source projects like Helm, Helmfile and Tekton. Decoupling the management of Cloud infrastructure away from Jenkins X to tools that are better suited for the job. Jenkins X has started with Terraform and this manages all the cloud resources needed by Jenkins X Over time Jenkins X plans to support other tools (aided by the Kubernetes Cluster API ) users in the Kubernetes ecosystem leverage such as crossplane. io , Google Config Connector , AWS Controller etc.</description></item><item><title>Blog: New features in the pipelines visualizer UI</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2021-01-18-blog-new-features-in-the-pipelines-visualizer-ui/</link><pubDate>Mon, 18 Jan 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2021-01-18-blog-new-features-in-the-pipelines-visualizer-ui/</guid><description>The Jenkins X Pipelines Visualizer UI has recently received a number of new features, so let’s do a little tour of these new features! When viewing a pipeline, the biggest new feature is the collapsed logs. No more hundreds - or thousands - of log lines, we now group the logs per-container (step), which are collapsed by default. Along with the status of the step and its duration, so it’s easier to go to the interesting part of the logs. Clicking on a log line will expand the logs for this specific container. You can also use the “Toggle Steps” button to expand/collapse the logs for all the steps at once. While we’re talking about the logs, you can notice the 2 new buttons: On top of the logs, we now display some information about the pipeline: The pipeline timeline has been improved to include all the steps for all stages, but it is currently hidden by default - to avoid using too much space. Clicking on a stage will bring you to the steps, and clicking on a step will bring you to the logs for this step. Note that for a pipeline which includes a deployment to a Preview Environment, the UI will also display a link to the application’s URL in that specific Preview Environment. The homepage got some love too, with: We started this project at v0, and we believe that now it has enough features to be a v1! On our roadmap - without any specific order - we have: Thanks to all the contributors! All contributions are welcomed, the source code is: github. com/jenkins-x/jx-pipelines-visualizer.</description></item><item><title>Blog: Jenkins X 3.x beta is here!</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2020-12-09-blog-jenkins-x-3-x-beta-is-here/</link><pubDate>Wed, 09 Dec 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2020-12-09-blog-jenkins-x-3-x-beta-is-here/</guid><description>I’m super excited to announce the 3. 0 beta of Jenkins X! Christmas has come early this year! the main documentation of the changes are: but here’s a brief summary of the differences: As a user the high level UX of Jenkins X is similar: We have been using Jenkins X 3. x in production now for many months (for CI/CD of all of the 3. x codebase and continuously upgrading our cluster in the standard way and it’s been much simpler and easier to use, operate and configure. In general Jenkins X 3. x is now much simpler and more flexible. It supports lots more platforms than before and should be easy to extend and configure for other platforms too. If you have never tried 3. x before then please follow the Admin Guide to get Jenkins X installed on your cloud provider, on-premises kubernetes cluster or minikube. If you previously tried the 3. x alpha then the migration instructions are here. For folks on older 2.</description></item><item><title>Blog: Jenkins X 3.x - beta is close!</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2020-12-04-blog-jenkins-x-3-x-beta-is-close/</link><pubDate>Fri, 04 Dec 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2020-12-04-blog-jenkins-x-3-x-beta-is-close/</guid><description>It has been ‘all hands on deck’ in recent months with the focus on Jenkins X 3 alpha. First off a huge thankyou to everyone involved. The OSS community spirit has really shone through what has been a very difficult year for everyone. Knowing that people from all over the world come and help each other, share banter and work at all hours of the day to help build out a true open source cloud native continuous delivery solution for developers - it’s quite fantastic to see and amazing to be apart of. As a result of all this hard work the Beta is iminent so this is a good opportunity to thank all involved so far and to outline what to expect in the coming days. While we’ve been in the Alpha phase it has provided us with the opportunity to deprecate and remove APIs, commands and obsolete features that existed in v2. This means we will not have any code dependency on the v2 codebase and so going forward v3 will be easier to maintain without the tech debt. With that, we aim to make a big push and roll out a few last changes in preparation for Beta, here’s a couple you will notice if you are already on the Alpha. We recommend taking time to understand these, and avoid upgrading for a few days so that changes can be handled in one go, as there will be a constant stream of larger updates happening: Balancing upgrades with continuous delivery brings many challenges. However with Kubernetes, GitOps, Jenkins X version streams (including the monthly LTS coming soon) and other tools like kpt makes the process more transparent and provides a greater level of high availability. Jenkins X automatically upgrades its own infrastructure with every version stream release and we haven’t experienced any disruption during the alpha period so far. We aim to continue this, but when we know there will be disruption we endeavour to inform and explain why ahead of time.</description></item><item><title>Blog: Accelerate your Tekton with Jenkins X</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2020-11-11-blog-accelerate-your-tekton-with-jenkins-x/</link><pubDate>Wed, 11 Nov 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2020-11-11-blog-accelerate-your-tekton-with-jenkins-x/</guid><description>One of the goals of Jenkins X has always been to help accelerate and automate Continuous Delivery so that developers can focus on delivering value to their customers; either by creating that new microservice or adding features to an existing project and not writing and managing pipelines. Pipeline engines like Jenkins and Tekton are awesome - they can do anything! But they start as a blank sheet of paper where you have to fill in all the details of how to compile your code, test it, verify it, tag it, release, distribute and delivery it to production. Figuring all that stuff out can take a huge amount of time to create and maintain. This gets even more complex as we are all creating more and more microservices each with their own pipelines making more and more things to create and manage. We want to be able to reuse pipelines and tasks to get work done. But at the same time we want flexibility; not all applications are the same and sometimes things need to be changed on a per team or application basis. In Jenkins X 2. x we went with a jenkins-x. xml approach to pipelines which let you inherit pipelines from reuable pipeline library and then use a composition DSL above Tekton which lets you add/remove/replace steps. e. g. to use the javascript pipeline library but override a step you could use: This was a pretty good approach; it lets us reuse common pipelines in a shared git repository and let’s reuse a composition DSL.</description></item><item><title>Blog: Hacktoberfest</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2020-09-23-blog-hacktoberfest/</link><pubDate>Wed, 23 Sep 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2020-09-23-blog-hacktoberfest/</guid><description>We are excited to announce that Jenkins X will be participating in Hacktoberfest again this year!

This project was started at Dailymotion and quickly shared with the Jenkins X community. There is already the Octant-based UI , so why a new UI? The main reason is that Octant “is an application and is intended as a single client tool and at this time there are no plans to support hosted versions of Octant” - see this thread on the Octant github repository for more information and details. So while Octant answers to a lot of use-cases, there is one for which it is not suited: quickly printing the build logs on a browser, for a specific pipeline. We want to be able to click on a link from a Pull/Merge Request, and get the pipeline logs. This is the specific use-case covered by the Pipelines Visualizer. We want to keep it small, focused, and fast. It’s a read-only UI, so there won’t be “actions” to trigger a pipeline - because it can already be done using “chatops” commands in the Pull Request for example. But there are a few interesting features already: This project was shared very early with the community, after just a few hours of work. So our short-term goal is to improve the UI - make it beautiful. We did a demo of jx-pipelines-visualizer at the last office hours : Check out the jx-pipelines-visualizer github repository if you want to install it in your cluster - there is a Helm Chart which can be added to your Jenkins X Dev Environment. And any contributions are welcomed - either create an issue or pull request in the project’s github repository, or come in the #jenkins-x-dev Slack Channel.</description></item><item><title>Blog: Jenkins X Talks at CDCon</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2020-09-16-blog-jenkins-x-talks-at-cdcon/</link><pubDate>Wed, 16 Sep 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2020-09-16-blog-jenkins-x-talks-at-cdcon/</guid><description>There will be six Jenkins X talks given by various speakers at the first-ever CDCon on October 7-8. The two-day virtual event, hosted by the Continuous Delivery Foundation, will focus on improving the world’s capacity to deliver software with security and speed. Register to attend the virtual event for only 25 USD and get access to all of the following Jenkins X talks and more. A CI/CD Framework for Production Machine Learning at Massive Scale (using Jenkins X and Seldon Core) Speaker: Alejandro Saucedo, Seldon Time: 1:15 PM PDT Managing production machine learning systems as internal data science infrastructure requirements grow, has uncovered new challenges which have required fundamentally different approaches to that of traditional CI/CD in software engineering. In this talk we will dive into the work we are doing at the SIG-MLOps and the CD Foundation towards developing the methodologies that encompass best practices to continuously integrate and deploy machine learning in production at massive scale. In this talk, we’ll provide key insights on the core MLOps concepts, as well as a hands-on coding example where we take a text classification model through its training, deployment and promotion as canary and shadow deployments, which will also allow us to get deeper and more specific insight on our production environment. Dailymotion’s Continuous Delivery Story Speaker: Vincent Behar, Dailymotion Time: 3:30 PM PDT In this session, Vincent will share Dailymotion’s Continuous Delivery story with Jenkins, Jenkins X and Tekton. He will come back on the initial state and issues faced on the CI/CD topic, and how it was solved. He will insist on the practices that were put in place and the benefits that resulted from switching to Jenkins X. He will conclude with the new challenges brought by improving Dailymotion’s Continuous Delivery platform. If you are wondering if Jenkins X is the right tool for you, and the impact it can have on your team(s), then this is the right session for you! Moving from Jenkins to Jenkins X: Scaling and Accelerating CI/CD Speaker: Dr Michael Garbade, Education Ecosystem Time: 12:00 PM PDT Jenkins has served as a continuous integration (CI) tool long before the emergence of Kubernetes and distributed systems running on cloud-native platforms. Working with Jenkins as a stand-alone open-source tool has proved to be extremely difficult for distributed systems engineers, as it is designed for small projects and not scalable to bigger projects.</description></item><item><title>Blog: Welcome to Jenkins X 3.x alpha!</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2020-09-16-blog-welcome-to-jenkins-x-3-x-alpha/</link><pubDate>Wed, 16 Sep 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2020-09-16-blog-welcome-to-jenkins-x-3-x-alpha/</guid><description>We are very pleased to announce the alpha release of Jenkins X version 3 You can read more about the overview of the architecture and components here. This release has lots of benefits over version 2 is much easier to use, understand and manage. It is more flexible and simpler to configure for different infrastructures and cloud providers. The new release works well with any combination of helm 3, helmfile, kpt and/or kustomize. For those who’ve used Jenkins X version 2 you can check out a comparison of the two versions Here is a demo video showing how to get started with Jenkins X on Google Cloud with Terraform and Vault : We also did a live demo of getting started and using version 3 at the octant office hours last week. We also included the helmfile based preview environments enhancement via the new jx-preview plugin which makes it much easier to make more sophisticated previews such as We now have support, via Terraform for 2 of the big 3 public clouds: Azure support is getting really close; if you’d like to help get it ready join us on slack Also when using your laptop or local kubernetes cluster without terraform we support: We are working on improving the UX of the installation/upgrade; we’re hoping to soon have a pure terraform (or Terraform Cloud) way to spin up a Jenkins X installation on a public cloud with a minimum of fuss. We’ll hopefully blog about that soon… So please take it for a spin and let us know what you think ! If you can think of any ways we can improve let us know!.</description></item><item><title>Blog: Octant: the OSS UI for Jenkins X</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2020-08-06-blog-octant-the-oss-ui-for-jenkins-x/</link><pubDate>Thu, 06 Aug 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2020-08-06-blog-octant-the-oss-ui-for-jenkins-x/</guid><description>A common question we have heard in the community over the years is Is there an open source UI for Jenkins X?. Well we now have an answer: its Octant using the octant-jx plugin. We love Octant because: Longer term we’re planning on making most of the developer and operations features of Jenkins X available through the UI via octant-jx. e. g. we hope as part of Jenkins X 3. x you’ll be able to install or upgrade Jenkins X and watch the installation proceed all via Octant. But already right now today you can: Find out more about installing and using Octant here. We did a demo of octant-jx at the last office hours. We also presented octant-jx at the octant office hours this week. Here is a demo video showing octant in action with Jenkins X :.</description></item></channel></rss>
