Containers provide integrated dependency management and enable a standard distribution and deployment model for any workload. With Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (Amazon EKS), Kubernetes has emerged as a go-to solution for customers running large-scale containerized workloads that need to efficiently scale to meet evolving needs. However, one persistent challenge continues to impact specific deployment and scaling aspects of Kubernetes workload operations. Container image pulls, particularly when working with large and complex container images, can directly impact the responsiveness and agility of your systems. With the growth of AI/ML workloads, where we see particularly large images, this directly impacts operations as images may take several minutes to pull and prepare. In our recent Under the Hood post for EKS Ultra Scale Clusters, we briefly touched on our evolving solution for this problem, Seekable OCI (SOCI) Parallel Pull. In this post, we’ll explain how container image pulls work and how they impact deployment and scaling operations, we’ll dive deeper into how SOCI parallel pull works, and finally show how it can help you improve image pull performance with your workloads on Amazon EKS. As average container image sizes have grown in recent years, container startup performance has become a critical element of modern cloud native system performance. Image pull and preparation can account for more than 75% of total startup time for new and scaling workloads. This challenge is particularly acute with the rise of AI/ML workloads on Amazon EKS. These workloads have driven significant growth in container image sizes, where images are commonly tens of gigabytes in size.</description></item><item><title>Metal3.io becomes a CNCF incubating project</title><link>https://kubermates.org/events/2025-08-27-metal3-io-becomes-a-cncf-incubating-project/</link><pubDate>Wed, 27 Aug 2025 19:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/events/2025-08-27-metal3-io-becomes-a-cncf-incubating-project/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;The CNCF Technical Oversight Committee (TOC) has voted to accept Metal3.io as a CNCF incubating project.

Amazon EKS provides two types of insights: Configuration insights and Upgrade insights. Configuration insights identify misconfigurations in your EKS Hybrid Nodes setup that could impair functionality of your cluster or workloads. Upgrade insights identify issues that could impact your ability to upgrade to new versions of Kubernetes. To see the list of insight checks performed and any relevant issues that Amazon EKS has identified, you can call the look in the AWS Management Console, the AWS CLI, AWS SDKs, and Amazon EKS ListInsights API operation. Open the Amazon EKS console. From the cluster list, choose the name of the Amazon EKS cluster for which you want to see the insights. Choose Monitor cluster. Choose the Cluster health tab. In the Configuration insights table, you will see the following columns: Name â The check that was performed by Amazon EKS against the cluster. Insight status â An insight with a status of Error means that there is a misconfiguration that is likely impacting cluster functionality. An insight with a status of Warning means that the configuration doesnât match the documented approach, but that cluster functionality might work if you configured it intentionally.</description></item><item><title>Kubernetes v1.34: Of Wind &amp; Will (O' WaW)</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-08-27-kubernetes-v1-34-of-wind-will-o-waw/</link><pubDate>Wed, 27 Aug 2025 10:30:00 -0800</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-08-27-kubernetes-v1-34-of-wind-will-o-waw/</guid><description>Editors: Agustina Barbetta, Alejandro Josue Leon Bellido, Graziano Casto, Melony Qin, Dipesh Rawat Similar to previous releases, the release of Kubernetes v1. 34 introduces new stable, beta, and alpha features. The consistent delivery of high-quality releases underscores the strength of our development cycle and the vibrant support from our community. This release consists of 58 enhancements. Of those enhancements, 23 have graduated to Stable, 22 have entered Beta, and 13 have entered Alpha. There are also some deprecations and removals in this release; make sure to read about those. A release powered by the wind around us — and the will within us. Every release cycle, we inherit winds that we don&amp;rsquo;t really control — the state of our tooling, documentation, and the historical quirks of our project. Sometimes these winds fill our sails, sometimes they push us sideways or die down. What keeps Kubernetes moving isn&amp;rsquo;t the perfect winds, but the will of our sailors who adjust the sails, man the helm, chart the courses and keep the ship steady. The release happens not because conditions are always ideal, but because of the people who build it, the people who release it, and the bears ^ , cats, dogs, wizards, and curious minds who keep Kubernetes sailing strong — no matter which way the wind blows. This release, Of Wind &amp;amp; Will (O&amp;rsquo; WaW) , honors the winds that have shaped us, and the will that propels us forward.</description></item><item><title>Pre-release v2.9.11-rc1</title><link>https://kubermates.org/releases/2025-08-27-pre-release-v2-9-11-rc1/</link><pubDate>Wed, 27 Aug 2025 17:32:18 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/releases/2025-08-27-pre-release-v2-9-11-rc1/</guid><description>There was an error while loading.

However, enterprises face significant challenges in AI adoption, especially concerning privacy, data security, and the need for adaptable infrastructure. This is why Broadcom announced VMware Private AI. Today Broadcom and AMD are announcing the expansion of our collaboration to Advance AI for enterprises with a private, secure, and high-performance AI infrastructure. We will release in the future a joint platform bringing VMware Cloud Foundation (VCF) together with AMD Enterprise AI software and AMD Instinct™ GPUs. Together this will enable privacy and security of infrastructure, simplify infrastructure management and streamline AI model deployment. We will also enable Broadcom’s Enhanced DirectPath (I/O) driver models with AMD GPUs to take advantage of VCF’s unique virtualization capabilities for delivering a scalable and efficient platform for AI workloads. Our expanded efforts directly tackle the core issues enterprises encounter with AI deployments: The core of this expanded collaboration is a robust architecture we will release in the future for enterprise AI. Let’s review the components of this: Note: Supermicro Computer Inc. server AS-8125GS-TNMR2 with MI300 GPUs are now supported in DirectPath I/O mode with VCF. Let’s get into some of the capabilities that this expanded collaboration will enable for customers in future. This collaboration will enable privacy and control of corporate data, integrated security and management and help enterprises build and deploy private and secure AI models.</description></item><item><title>Building your GenAI Agents on VCF with Private AI Services</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-08-26-building-your-genai-agents-on-vcf-with-private-ai-services/</link><pubDate>Tue, 26 Aug 2025 12:30:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-08-26-building-your-genai-agents-on-vcf-with-private-ai-services/</guid><description>Today at VMware Explore’s general session you saw Chris Wolf demonstrate Intelligent Assist for VMware Cloud Foundation, providing AI-powered assistance for our users. In this blog, we’ll take a step behind the curtain to see how these capabilities are running in VCF, using AI features that our customers can also use to build their own AI experiences with their own private data. VMware Private AI services enable administrators to safely and securely import and share approved AI models (Model Gallery and Model Governance); scale and run Models as a Service for their organization (Model Runtime and ML API gateway); create Knowledge bases and regularly refresh data in a fully supported vector database for creating RAG applications (Data Indexing and Retrieval Service in partnership with Data Services Manager); and provide developers a UI where they can compose models, knowledge bases, and tools together to create Agents (Agent Builder). The Intelligent Assist service is using these capabilities to run the Intelligent Assist agent, and VCF engineering teams are using these services as a common AI platform to deliver joint services and AI workflows. Customers can also use these same capabilities for their own teams. These features give private cloud administrators what they need to safely download, validate, and share models with teams across their cloud. Learn about how to safely onboard popular models from upstream and ensure the model’s behavior meets your enterprises’ expectations and requirements – and behavior doesn’t drift over time in this blog post. Now that you have models securely imported and shared with the right folks in your organization, you will want to run them in an efficient and scalable way. Gone are the days of every division running their own separate copies of the same popular models – instead your team can provide Models as a Service using the Model Runtime. Deploy models on a fully maintained runtime stack from directly within VCF, and then horizontally scale them as they come under load with no end user impact, as users broker their requests via the ML API gateway. This also gives you flexibility to do rolling upgrades of models with zero end user impact. This method of deploying models allows separate lines of business or tenants within a Cloud Service Provider to keep their data separate from each other while ensuring high GPU utilization.</description></item><item><title>Engineering the Next Generation of VMware Cloud Foundation</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-08-26-engineering-the-next-generation-of-vmware-cloud-foundation/</link><pubDate>Tue, 26 Aug 2025 12:30:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-08-26-engineering-the-next-generation-of-vmware-cloud-foundation/</guid><description>The private cloud is entering a new era. The workloads our infrastructure must serve have shifted from traditional applications only to also include distributed systems, data-intensive analytics, and AI-driven models that demand unprecedented agility and scale. VMware Cloud Foundation (VCF) has always been about giving customers a single, integrated platform to build and operate their private cloud with consistency. But the requirements are evolving—and so must the platform. And VMware Cloud Foundation isn’t just adapting to enterprise transformation – it’s leading it. VCFis the engine driving how modern businesses reimagine their infrastructure, applications, and data strategies. Each new innovation isn’t a reaction to where the industry is going—it sets the pace for what’s possible in the private cloud – whether it’s in a central datacenter, edge or in the hyperscaler environment. VCF 9. 0 set the benchmark for the modern private cloud: Missed it? What’s New In VMware Cloud Foundation 9. 0 VCF 9. 0 was just the beginning of that journey. We’re here to solve the next set of challenges that the world of IT needs to overcome.</description></item><item><title>Strengthened Cyber-Risk Management and Compliance for Large-Scale VMware Cloud Foundation Environments</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-08-26-strengthened-cyber-risk-management-and-compliance-for-large-scale-vmware-cloud-f/</link><pubDate>Tue, 26 Aug 2025 12:30:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-08-26-strengthened-cyber-risk-management-and-compliance-for-large-scale-vmware-cloud-f/</guid><description>Is data an organization’s most valuable asset, or biggest liability? The ever-evolving risks presented by today’s modern threat landscape pose unprecedented challenges that most today are ill-equipped to address. With ransomware attacks becoming increasingly sophisticated and regulatory guidelines more stringent, cyber-risk management and compliance lie at the core of every strategic IT decision made by C-Suite executives and board members. 51% of leaders reported security, data protection and privacy as key priorities to enable compliant operations 1. However, the path to achieve successful outcomes is beset with obstacles. Why Organizations Struggle to Manage Cyber-Risk and Maintain Compliance Reactive vs. Proactive Response: data is scattered across different applications in multiple geographic locations, each with its own rules and regulations. 63% of organizations report that complexity from the disaggregated nature of data as the main challenge to maintain compliance 2. Policy monitoring for virtual machines (VMs), containers, databases, infrastructure and technology stack components is siloed, which hinders early detection of drifts and leads to a reactive versus proactive response. Manual Remediation and Recovery: policy management and recovery lack automation, which directly impacts an organization’s ability to scale operations and preserve compliance as applications are changed, moved or deleted. Intense manual intervention inevitably delays time to audit-readiness and leaves unaddressed gaps that could expose critical workloads to increased damage. Stitching of Multiple Tools: consolidation of cyber-risk management, resilience and recovery is easier said than done. Most organizations rely on a piecemeal approach, plagued with operational complexity and inefficiencies that increase chances of human error.</description></item><item><title>Unleashing the Power of Private AI: New Innovations from Broadcom with NVIDIA</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-08-26-unleashing-the-power-of-private-ai-new-innovations-from-broadcom-with-nvidia/</link><pubDate>Tue, 26 Aug 2025 12:30:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-08-26-unleashing-the-power-of-private-ai-new-innovations-from-broadcom-with-nvidia/</guid><description>Enterprises can get tremendous productivity and business transformation from AI.

A significant challenge for telecommunication (telco) service providers is the management of different software versions of these network functions, especially in a multivendor environment. A particular version may include new features, bug fixes, or require specific configurations. Consequently, testing of the network functions is complex, going beyond the verification of each component&amp;rsquo;s functionality to ensure that various versions of these network functions can interoperate. Dealing with this complexity necessitates extensive testing automation to guarantee streamlined operations across the service provider’s network. Adopting a cloud-native design for the 5G core gives service providers a competitive edge in building networks that easily scale and adapt. A distributed and disaggregated 5G core network introduces additional challenges, particularly around ensuring that all the different components can work together. As 5G core cloud-native network functions (CNFs) are made up of microservices that are constantly being updated and deployed in a dynamic environment, keeping tabs on security and adherence to standards becomes an overwhelming task. To ensure that all independently developed components of the 5G core operate effectively, the various network functions within the 5G core must interoperate efficiently, adhering to 3GPP standards. Still, as each 5G core vendor implements their microservices slightly differently, rigorous testing of these interactions is crucial. To ensure robustness and performance, the 5G core needs to be tested at different levels: Red Hat and Rebaca have collaborated to produce an autonomous continuous testing framework to address the challenges outlined with 5G core lifecycle management. The framework is engineered to facilitate the consistent delivery of compliant and interoperable 5G core CNFs.</description></item><item><title>Pre-release v2.11.5-alpha3</title><link>https://kubermates.org/releases/2025-08-25-pre-release-v2-11-5-alpha3/</link><pubDate>Mon, 25 Aug 2025 22:02:52 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/releases/2025-08-25-pre-release-v2-11-5-alpha3/</guid><description>There was an error while loading.

Military organizations are increasingly operating across a hybrid infrastructure, spanning the strategic core, deployed edge, and tactical edge, while maintaining absolute control over their systems. However, this evolution presents significant challenges, from siloed technologies to cybersecurity threats. Defence organizations must navigate these obstacles by adopting a unified platform approach, leveraging an open framework based on open standards to strengthen autonomy, security, and seamless operations across all environments. Traditionally, defence operations began in the strategic core, which were large, on-premise data centers disconnected from the internet. These handled everything from mission planning to logistics. The first wave of transformation introduced private cloud solutions, allowing military organizations to scale infrastructure dynamically while maintaining digital sovereignty. Many defence entities remain cautious about using the public cloud due to security concerns, opting instead for air-gapped private clouds—physically isolated environments within their facilities—so only screened personnel and verified secure networks have access. Today, the focus has shifted to edge computing, highlighting the need for smarter, real-time, and autonomous decision-making in the field. Defence organizations now operate across two key edge environments, the deployed edge and the tactical edge. The deployed edge consists of mini data centres, capable of running mission-critical applications, processing intelligence and supporting AI workloads. Meanwhile, the tactical edge encompasses lightweight, ruggedized devices such as drones, autonomous vehicles, and soldier-worn systems that can collect, analyse, and act on data in real time, often completely disconnected from central networks.</description></item><item><title>How I Team Up with GenAI to Craft Conference Talk Proposals</title><link>https://kubermates.org/events/2025-08-22-how-i-team-up-with-genai-to-craft-conference-talk-proposals/</link><pubDate>Fri, 22 Aug 2025 20:09:07 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/events/2025-08-22-how-i-team-up-with-genai-to-craft-conference-talk-proposals/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;TL;DR: GenAI can help you write conference abstracts, but if you use it without injecting your own curiosity and humanness, reviewers can tell.

The assessment phase involves evaluating technical feasibility for Amazon EKS workloads, analyzing current Kubernetes environments, identifying compatibility issues, estimating costs, and determining timelines with business impact considerations. During the mobilize phase, organizations create detailed migration plans, establish EKS environments with proper networking and security, train teams, and develop testing procedures. The final migrate and modernize phase involves transferring applications and data, validating functionality, implementing cloud-centered features, optimizing resources and costs, and enhancing observability to fully use AWS capabilities. One of the most significant challenges organizations face during the process is cost estimation, which happens in the assessment phase. Karpenter is an open source Kubernetes node autoscaler that efficiently provisions just-in-time compute resources to match workload demands. Unlike traditional autoscalers, Karpenter directly integrates with cloud providers to make intelligent, real-time decisions about instance types, availability zones, and capacity options. It evaluates pod requirements and constraints to select optimal instances, considering factors such as CPU, memory, price, and availability. Karpenter can consolidate workloads for cost efficiency and rapidly scale from zero to handle sudden demand spikes. It supports both spot and on-demand instances, and automatically terminates nodes when they’re no longer needed, optimizing cluster resource utilization and reducing cloud costs. Karpenter uses the concept of Providers to interact with different infrastructure platforms for provisioning and managing compute resources. KWOK (Kubernetes WithOut Kubelet) is a toolkit that simulates data plane nodes without allocating actual infrastructure, and can be used as a provider to create lightweight testing environments that enable developers to validate provisioning decisions, try various (virtual) instance types, and debug scaling behaviors.</description></item><item><title>v1.31.12-rc5+rke2r1</title><link>https://kubermates.org/releases/2025-08-21-v1-31-12-rc5-rke2r1/</link><pubDate>Thu, 21 Aug 2025 16:20:55 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/releases/2025-08-21-v1-31-12-rc5-rke2r1/</guid><description>There was an error while loading.

Our efforts are driven by minimizing the increase in energy consumption of AI, cloud computing, and IT infrastructure. Red Hat focuses on open source technologies designed to improve energy efficiency across IT environments. This includes: InstructLab is an open source project that enhances large language models (LLMs) used in generative AI (gen AI), upgrading an LLM with less human input and fewer resources than retraining. One of the key aspects of InstructLab is its focus on smaller, fine-tuned language models. This approach directly translates to improved energy efficiency compared to larger, more resource-intensive LLMs deployed by competitors. Smaller language models require significantly less computational power for training and inference, leading to reduced energy consumption. InstructLab optimizes performance by tailoring SLMs to specific tasks or domains, enhancing efficiency, minimizing wasteful energy, and enabling models to run on lower-power CPUs as opposed to power-hungry GPUs. This lower energy consumption results in reduced operational costs, providing both financial benefits and support for sustainability goals. Red Hat&amp;rsquo;s energy-efficient solutions offer significant benefits for enterprises, from reducing operational costs to helping achieve ambitious sustainability targets. By optimizing resource utilization and enhancing performance, these solutions also provide a crucial competitive advantage in today&amp;rsquo;s market, which include: Red Hat and SoftBank have collaborate d on Artificial Intelligence Radio Access Network (AI-RAN) to optimize power consumption in datacenters powering AI applications and vRAN. This project integrates Kepler, an open source project founded at Red Hat, into SoftBank&amp;rsquo;s AI and Telecom Radio Access System (AITRAS) platform.</description></item><item><title>Honoring Styra’s Contributions To OPA</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-08-20-honoring-styra-s-contributions-to-opa/</link><pubDate>Wed, 20 Aug 2025 23:03:50 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-08-20-honoring-styra-s-contributions-to-opa/</guid><description>As the creator of Open Policy Agent (OPA), Styra has played an extraordinary role in shaping the Policy as Code (PaC) movement and advancing cloud-native security and governance. This week, the founders and core team behind Styra announced that they are joining Apple. I first met the Styra team at KubeCon 2017 in Austin, when Brian Grant saw an early demo of what we were building, and suggested that I talk to them. Although we have significantly different approaches to PaC, one of my favorite moments at each KubeCon since has been catching up with folks from Styra and exchanging notes on the space. We here at Nirmata, want to take a moment to recognize and thank the entire Styra team – their founders Teemu, Tim, Torin, along with Anders, Charlie and many others – for their pioneering work. Without their vision and drive, there would be no PaC ecosystem as we know it today. At Nirmata, we know that Kyverno’s journey, and our own, would not have been possible without the foundation laid by the OPA community. The early adoption of OPA proved the need for declarative policies and automated governance. It set the standard for how organizations think about declarative policies across cloud and infrastructure environments and it will continue to play an important role in the CNCF landscape. We are also encouraged that the Styra team has found a great home at Apple. With such a strong technology leader supporting them, the OPA community can look forward to ongoing innovation, stability, and new opportunities for growth. We are excited to see what comes next in the OPA roadmap and how the project continues to evolve as a critical part of the cloud native landscape.</description></item><item><title>Kubernetes v1.34.0-rc.2</title><link>https://kubermates.org/releases/2025-08-20-kubernetes-v1-34-0-rc-2/</link><pubDate>Wed, 20 Aug 2025 21:15:15 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/releases/2025-08-20-kubernetes-v1-34-0-rc-2/</guid><description>See kubernetes-announce@.

If you&amp;rsquo;re moving from a colo that someone manages to VMware, the cloud, or a different VMware data center, they all look and feel different. Even if you&amp;rsquo;re using the same virtualization provider, storage is probably handled differently. There has to be a lot of planning and strategy around how to copy data from one area to another since that’s not something natively built into your virtualization provider. You also have to figure out networking, DNS, routing, etc. With Red Hat OpenShift , all of these components are software-defined. You get software-defined DNS, networking, and storage layers all because it’s based on Kubernetes. Out-of-the-box OpenShift won’t “automagically” failover without additional levels of configuration, much like VMware or other traditional infrastructure environments. But the tools required are mostly there for you, either pre-packaged and open-source or robustly tested and a standard in the space. You can set up OpenShift in any environment because the least common denominator for everything, no matter where you are (bare metal or virtual), is the operating system This is where OpenShift lives. That’s why it is the perfect tool for building a truly agile infrastructure that can move freely between environments, providing instantaneous disaster recovery for businesses. There are different benefits of infrastructure agility.</description></item><item><title>Cross-service confused deputy prevention</title><link>https://kubermates.org/releases/2025-08-19-cross-service-confused-deputy-prevention/</link><pubDate>Tue, 19 Aug 2025 19:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/releases/2025-08-19-cross-service-confused-deputy-prevention/</guid><description>Help improve this page To contribute to this user guide, choose the Edit this page on GitHub link that is located in the right pane of every page. The confused deputy problem is a security issue where an entity that doesnât have permission to perform an action can coerce a more-privileged entity to perform the action. In AWS, cross-service impersonation can result in the confused deputy problem. Cross-service impersonation can occur when one service (the calling service ) calls another service (the called service ). The calling service can be manipulated to use its permissions to act on another customerâs resources in a way it should not otherwise have permission to access. To prevent this, AWS provides tools that help you protect your data for all services with service principals that have been given access to resources in your account. We recommend using the aws:SourceArn , aws:SourceAccount global condition context keys in resource policies to limit the permissions that Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (Amazon EKS) gives another service to the resource. Use aws:SourceArn to associate only one resource with cross-service access. Use aws:SourceAccount to let any resource in that account be associated with the cross-service use. The most effective way to protect against the confused deputy problem is to use the aws:SourceArn global condition context key with the full ARN of the resource. If you donât know the full ARN of the resource or if you are specifying multiple resources, use the aws:SourceArn global context condition key with wildcard characters (&lt;em&gt;) for the unknown portions of the ARN. For example, arn:aws:&lt;servicename&gt;:&lt;/em&gt;:&amp;lt;123456789012&amp;gt;:*.</description></item><item><title>Tuning Linux Swap for Kubernetes: A Deep Dive</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-08-19-tuning-linux-swap-for-kubernetes-a-deep-dive/</link><pubDate>Tue, 19 Aug 2025 10:30:00 -0800</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-08-19-tuning-linux-swap-for-kubernetes-a-deep-dive/</guid><description>The Kubernetes NodeSwap feature , likely to graduate to stable in the upcoming Kubernetes v1. 34 release, allows swap usage: a significant shift from the conventional practice of disabling swap for performance predictability. This article focuses exclusively on tuning swap on Linux nodes, where this feature is available. By allowing Linux nodes to use secondary storage for additional virtual memory when physical RAM is exhausted, node swap support aims to improve resource utilization and reduce out-of-memory (OOM) kills. However, enabling swap is not a &amp;ldquo;turn-key&amp;rdquo; solution. The performance and stability of your nodes under memory pressure are critically dependent on a set of Linux kernel parameters. Misconfiguration can lead to performance degradation and interfere with Kubelet&amp;rsquo;s eviction logic. In this blogpost, I&amp;rsquo;ll dive into critical Linux kernel parameters that govern swap behavior. I will explore how these parameters influence Kubernetes workload performance, swap utilization, and crucial eviction mechanisms. I will present various test results showcasing the impact of different configurations, and share my findings on achieving optimal settings for stable and high-performing Kubernetes clusters. At a high level, the Linux kernel manages memory through pages, typically 4KiB in size. When physical memory becomes constrained, the kernel&amp;rsquo;s page replacement algorithm decides which pages to move to swap space.</description></item><item><title>Celebrating 100 Days of Kagent</title><link>https://kubermates.org/events/2025-08-19-celebrating-100-days-of-kagent/</link><pubDate>Tue, 19 Aug 2025 13:30:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/events/2025-08-19-celebrating-100-days-of-kagent/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;When we first introduced kagent on March 17th, 2025, we had a bold vision: to bring agentic AI to cloud native—empowering platforms and DevOps engineers to harness AI agents for solving real operational challenges.

Brilliant. It’s exactly what KodeKloud is about. When attendees, speakers, and industry peers tell you that at KubeCon India, it’s a clear sign that what KodeKloud is doing is making a real impact. For KodeKloud, KubeCon India 2025 was more than a tech conference. It was a celebration of community, connection, and the power of practical learning in the Cloud Native space. From conversations with global leaders to meeting hundreds of learners face-to-face, this year meant more than ever before. One of the proudest moments for us at KubeCon India 2025 was standing alongside the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) and the Linux Foundation Education team to announce a new initiative tailored specifically for learners in India. This partnership is designed to make Cloud Native certifications more accessible, affordable, and achievable in the region through: KodeKloud – Linux Foundation Partnership for Localized Certification Payment Click to learn more and explore our partnership → For us at KodeKloud, this is about much more than payments - it’s about removing barriers that keep talented engineers from reaching their potential. India is home to some of the most passionate DevOps and Cloud Native professionals in the world, and now, more of them will have a clear, affordable pathway to earning globally recognized certifications. The announcement was made live at KubeCon, with CNCF and Linux Foundation leaders sharing the stage - a powerful reminder that when communities and education providers work together, opportunities multiply. One of the standout moments was when Mumshad Mannambeth , KodeKloud’s founder, met Chris Aniszczyk , the CTO of the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF). Their conversation touched on: It was a meeting of minds that reflected exactly what KubeCon stands for - collaboration, knowledge-sharing, and driving the industry forward together.</description></item><item><title>August 15, 2025</title><link>https://kubermates.org/releases/2025-08-15-august-15-2025/</link><pubDate>Fri, 15 Aug 2025 00:00:00 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/releases/2025-08-15-august-15-2025/</guid><description>This page includes release notes for all channels and releases.

Progressive delivery strategies, such as canary deployments, allow organizations to release new features by shifting traffic incrementally between old and new versions of a service. This allows organizations to first release features to a small subset of users, monitor system behavior and performance in real time, and automatically roll back if anomalies are detected. This is particularly valuable in modern microservices environments running on platforms such as Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (Amazon EKS) , where service meshes and traffic routers provide the necessary infrastructure for fine-grained control over traffic routing. This post explores an architectural approach to implementing progressive delivery using Amazon VPC Lattice, Amazon CloudWatch Synthetics , and Argo Rollouts. The solution uses VPC Lattice for enhanced traffic control across microservices, CloudWatch Synthetics for real-time health and validation monitoring, and Argo Rollouts for orchestrating canary updates. The content in this post addresses readers who are already familiar with networking constructs on Amazon Web Services (AWS), such as Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon VPC) , CloudWatch Synthetics and Amazon EKS. Instead of defining these services, we focus on their capabilities and integration with VPC Lattice. We also build upon your existing understanding of VPC Lattice concepts and Argo Rollouts. For more background on Amazon VPC Lattice, we recommend that you review the post, Build secure multi-account multi-VPC connectivity for your applications with Amazon VPC Lattice , and the collection of resources in the VPC Lattice Getting started guide. The architecture integrates multiple AWS services and Kubernetes-native components, providing a comprehensive solution for progressive delivery: In this section we consider an application running on Amazon EKS, where a new version of a microservice— prodDetail v2 —needs to be rolled out with minimal impact to users relying on the stable version v1. To do this, we implement a canary deployment strategy using VPC Lattice, Argo Rollouts, CloudWatch Synthetics, and AnalysisTemplates.</description></item><item><title>August 12, 2025</title><link>https://kubermates.org/releases/2025-08-12-august-12-2025/</link><pubDate>Tue, 12 Aug 2025 00:00:00 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/releases/2025-08-12-august-12-2025/</guid><description>This page includes release notes for all channels and releases.

To simplify Kubernetes management and troubleshooting, we&amp;rsquo;re thrilled to introduce Headlamp AI Assistant : a powerful new plugin for Headlamp that helps you understand and operate your Kubernetes clusters and applications with greater clarity and ease. Whether you&amp;rsquo;re a seasoned engineer or just getting started, the AI Assistant offers: Here is a demo of the AI Assistant in action as it helps troubleshoot an application running with issues in a Kubernetes cluster: Large Language Models (LLMs) have transformed not just how we access data but also how we interact with it. The rise of tools like ChatGPT opened a world of possibilities, inspiring a wave of new applications. Asking questions or giving commands in natural language is intuitive, especially for users who aren&amp;rsquo;t deeply technical. Now everyone can quickly ask how to do X or Y, without feeling awkward or having to traverse pages and pages of documentation like before. Therefore, Headlamp AI Assistant brings a conversational UI to Headlamp , powered by LLMs that Headlamp users can configure with their own API keys. It is available as a Headlamp plugin, making it easy to integrate into your existing setup. Users can enable it by installing the plugin and configuring it with their own LLM API keys, giving them control over which model powers the assistant. Once enabled, the assistant becomes part of the Headlamp UI, ready to respond to contextual queries and perform actions directly from the interface. As expected, the AI Assistant is focused on helping users with Kubernetes concepts. Yet, while there is a lot of value in responding to Kubernetes related questions from Headlamp&amp;rsquo;s UI, we believe that the great benefit of such an integration is when it can use the context of what the user is experiencing in an application.</description></item><item><title>Red Hat Named a Leader in 2025 Gartner® Magic Quadrant™ for Cloud-Native Application Platforms for the Second Consecutive Year</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-08-07-red-hat-named-a-leader-in-2025-gartner-magic-quadrant-for-cloud-native-applicati/</link><pubDate>Thu, 07 Aug 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-08-07-red-hat-named-a-leader-in-2025-gartner-magic-quadrant-for-cloud-native-applicati/</guid><description>Share This week we announced that Red Hat has been positioned as a Leader for the second year in a row in the 2025 Gartner® Magic Quadrant™ for Cloud-Native Application Platforms.

Source: Gartner, “Magic Quadrant for Cloud-Native Application Platforms,” August 2025 To help further explain the evaluation of the Gartner Magic Quadrant from our point of view, we’re answering some of the most frequently asked questions. “Magic Quadrant reports are a culmination of rigorous, fact-based research in specific markets, providing a wide-angle view of the relative positions of the providers in markets where growth is high and provider differentiation is distinct. Providers are positioned into four quadrants: Leaders, Challengers, Visionaries and Niche Players. The research enables you to get the most from market analysis in alignment with your unique business and technology needs. ” “Gartner defines cloud-native application platforms as those that provide managed application runtime environments for applications and integrated capabilities to manage the life cycle of an application or application component. They typically enable distributed application deployments and support cloud style operations — such as elasticity, multitenancy and self-service — without requiring the development team to provision infrastructure or manage containers. Cloud-native application platforms are designed to facilitate the deployment, runtime execution, and management of modern cloud-native or cloud-optimized applications without the need to manage any underlying infrastructure. Also, they are designed to enhance developer productivity, accelerate development and deployment cycles, and increase operational effectiveness by making it easier to scale on demand. Cloud-native application platforms offer a structured execution environment for applications, effectively hiding the complexities of the underlying infrastructure and computing resources.</description></item><item><title>Top 10 articles Red Hat customers are reading right now</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-08-07-top-10-articles-red-hat-customers-are-reading-right-now/</link><pubDate>Thu, 07 Aug 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-08-07-top-10-articles-red-hat-customers-are-reading-right-now/</guid><description>Share Staying on top of the latest advancements in open source technology is more critical than ever.

In this post, we guide you through integrating Tailscale with your Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS) Hybrid Nodes environment. Amazon EKS Hybrid Nodes is a feature of Amazon EKS that enables you to streamline your Kubernetes management by connecting on-premises and edge infrastructure to an EKS cluster running in Amazon Web Services (AWS). This unified approach allows AWS to manage the Kubernetes control plane in the cloud while you maintain your hybrid nodes in on-premises or edge locations. We demonstrate how to configure a remote pod network and node address space. Install Tailscale on your hybrid nodes, set up a subnet router within your Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon VPC) , and update your AWS routes accordingly. This integration provides direct, encrypted connections that streamline the network architecture needed for EKS Hybrid Nodes. Although EKS Hybrid Nodes streamlines the Kubernetes management challenge, network connectivity between your on-premises infrastructure and AWS remains a critical requirement. Tailscale can help streamline this network connectivity between your EKS Hybrid Nodes data plane and Amazon EKS Kubernetes control plane. Unlike traditional VPNs, which tunnel all network traffic through a central gateway server, Tailscale creates a peer-to-peer mesh network (known as a tailnet ). It enables encrypted point-to-point connections using the open source WireGuard protocol, connecting devices and services across different networks with enhanced security features. However, you can still use Tailscale like a traditional VPN.</description></item><item><title>Kubernetes v1.34.0-rc.0</title><link>https://kubermates.org/releases/2025-08-06-kubernetes-v1-34-0-rc-0/</link><pubDate>Wed, 06 Aug 2025 20:20:08 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/releases/2025-08-06-kubernetes-v1-34-0-rc-0/</guid><description>See kubernetes-announce@.

This release will not include any removal or deprecation, but it is packed with an impressive number of enhancements. Here are some of the features we are most excited about in this cycle! Please note that this information reflects the current state of v1. 34 development and may change before release. The following list highlights some of the notable enhancements likely to be included in the v1. 34 release, but is not an exhaustive list of all planned changes. This is not a commitment and the release content is subject to change. Dynamic Resource Allocation (DRA) provides a flexible way to categorize, request, and use devices like GPUs or custom hardware in your Kubernetes cluster. Since the v1. 30 release, DRA has been based around claiming devices using structured parameters that are opaque to the core of Kubernetes. The relevant enhancement proposal, KEP-4381 , took inspiration from dynamic provisioning for storage volumes.</description></item><item><title>July 25, 2025</title><link>https://kubermates.org/releases/2025-07-25-july-25-2025/</link><pubDate>Fri, 25 Jul 2025 00:00:00 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/releases/2025-07-25-july-25-2025/</guid><description>This page includes release notes for all channels and releases.

In IPv6-enabled EKS clusters, each pod receives a unique IPv6 address from the Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon VPC) IPv6 range, with seamless compatibility facilitated by the Amazon EKS VPC Container Network Interface (CNI). This solution effectively addresses two major IPv4 limitations: the scarcity of private addresses and the security vulnerabilities created by overlapping IPv4 spaces that need Network Address Translation (NAT) at the node level. When transitioning to IPv6, you likely need to run both IPv4 and IPv6 EKS clusters simultaneously. This is particularly important for organizations using Istio Service Mesh with Amazon EKS, because IPv6 clusters must integrate with the existing Service Mesh and work smoothly alongside IPv4 clusters. To streamline this transition, you can configure your Istio Service Mesh to support both your current IPv4 EKS clusters and your new IPv6 EKS clusters. If Istio Service Mesh isn’t part of your infrastructure, then we suggest exploring Amazon VPC Lattice as an alternative solution to speed up your IPv6 implementation on AWS. This post provides a step-by-step guide for combining IPv6-enabled EKS clusters with your existing Istio Service Mesh and IPv4 workloads, enabling a graceful transition to IPv6 on AWS. This guide covers detailed instructions for enabling communication between IPv6 and IPv4 EKS clusters, along with recommended practices for implementing IPv6 across both single and multiple VPC configurations. The functionality of Amazon EKS IPv6 builds on the native dual-stack capabilities of VPC. When you enable IPv6 in your VPC, it receives both IPv4 prefixes and a /56 IPv6 prefix. This IPv6 prefix can come from three sources: Amazon’s Global Unicast Address (GUA) space, your own IPv6 range (BYOIPv6), or a Unique Local Address (ULA) space.</description></item><item><title>Pre-release v1.6.12-rc.1</title><link>https://kubermates.org/releases/2025-07-22-pre-release-v1-6-12-rc-1/</link><pubDate>Tue, 22 Jul 2025 10:34:13 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/releases/2025-07-22-pre-release-v1-6-12-rc-1/</guid><description>There was an error while loading.

You find the perfect conference, open the Call for Proposals (CFP) form, and pour your heart into it. You hit &amp;ldquo;submit. &amp;quot; And then you wait… That rejection email always stings. We’ve all been there. But what if you could change the odds? What if you could move from hoping your talk gets chosen to expecting it? After speaking at numerous global conferences and analyzing hundreds of accepted and rejected talks, I’ve found that a winning proposal isn’t about luck. It’s about strategy. This guide will break down that strategy, making it applicable for any tech event, from a local Google Community Day to the global stages of KubeCon or a Linux Foundation Summit. Before you write a single word of your abstract, you need to pick the right topic. The best topics sit at the intersection of three things: Your title is the first - and sometimes only - thing a reviewer reads. It needs to be a powerful hook.

EKS Hybrid Nodes provides you with the flexibility to run your containerized applications wherever needed, while maintaining standardized Kubernetes management practices and addressing latency, compliance, and data residency needs. EKS Hybrid Nodes accelerates infrastructure modernization by repurposing existing hardware investments. Organizations can harness the elastic scalability, high availability, and fully managed advantages of Amazon EKS, while making sure of operational consistency through unified workflows and toolsets across hybrid environments. One of the key aspects of the EKS Hybrid Nodes solution is the hybrid network architecture between the cloud-based Amazon EKS control plane and your on-premises nodes. This post dives deep into the cluster networking configurations, guiding you through the process of integrating an EKS cluster with hybrid nodes in your existing infrastructure. In this walkthrough, we set up different Container Network Interface (CNI) options and load balancing solutions on EKS Hybrid Nodes to meet your networking requirements. EKS Hybrid Nodes needs private network connectivity between the cloud-hosted Amazon EKS control plane and the hybrid nodes running in your on-premises environment. This connectivity can be established using either Amazon Web Services (AWS) Direct Connect or AWS Site-to-Site VPN , through an AWS Transit Gateway or the Virtual Private Gateway into your Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon VPC). For an optimal experience, AWS recommends reliable network connectivity with at least 100 Mbps bandwidth, and a maximum of 200ms round-trip latency, for hybrid nodes connecting to the AWS Region. This is general guidance rather than a strict requirement, and specific bandwidth and latency requirements may differ based on the quantity of hybrid nodes and your application’s unique characteristics. The node and pod Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR) blocks for your hybrid nodes and container workloads must be within the IPv4 RFC-1918 ranges.</description></item><item><title>v1.30.14-rc1+k3s2</title><link>https://kubermates.org/releases/2025-07-21-v1-30-14-rc1-k3s2/</link><pubDate>Mon, 21 Jul 2025 18:52:11 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/releases/2025-07-21-v1-30-14-rc1-k3s2/</guid><description>There was an error while loading.

Distributed training and LLMs fine-tuning, in particular, involves managing multiple nodes, GPUs, large datasets, and fault tolerance, which often requires deep Kubernetes knowledge. The Kubeflow Trainer v2 (KF Trainer) was created to hide this complexity, by abstracting Kubernetes from AI Practitioners and providing the easiest, most scalable way to run distributed PyTorch jobs. The main goals of Kubeflow Trainer v2 include: We’re deeply grateful to all contributors and community members who made the Trainer v2 possible with their hard work and valuable feedback. We’d like to give special recognition to andreyvelich , tenzen-y , electronic-waste , astefanutti , ironicbo , mahdikhashan , kramaranya , harshal292004 , akshaychitneni , chenyi015 and the rest of the contributors. We would also like to highlight ahg-g , kannon92 , and vsoch whose feedback was essential while we designed the Kubeflow Trainer architecture together with the Batch WG. See the full contributor list for everyone who helped make this release possible. Kubeflow Trainer v2 represents the next evolution of the Kubeflow Training Operator , building on over seven years of experience running ML workloads on Kubernetes. The journey began in 2017 when the Kubeflow project introduced TFJob to orchestrate TensorFlow training on Kubernetes. At that time, Kubernetes lacked many of the advanced batch processing features needed for distributed ML training, so the community had to implement these capabilities from scratch. Over the years, the project expanded to support multiple ML frameworks including PyTorch , MXNet , MPI , and XGBoost through various specialized operators. In 2021, these were consolidated into the unified Training Operator v1.</description></item><item><title>🧩 GitHub Actions Composite vs Reusable Workflows</title><link>https://kubermates.org/blog/github-actions-composite-vs-reusable-workflows-4bih/</link><pubDate>Fri, 18 Jul 2025 08:41:53 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/blog/github-actions-composite-vs-reusable-workflows-4bih/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="how-to-standardize-and-supercharge-your-cicd-pipelines-across-projects"&gt;How to standardize and supercharge your CI/CD pipelines across projects&lt;/h2&gt;

While powerful quantum computers are still largely theoretical for many applications, their potential to break current cryptographic standards is a serious concern, especially for long-lived systems. This is where Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC) comes in. In this article, I&amp;rsquo;ll dive into what PQC means for TLS and, more specifically, for the Kubernetes ecosystem. I’ll explain what the (suprising) state of PQC in Kubernetes is and what the implications are for current and future clusters. Post-Quantum Cryptography refers to cryptographic algorithms that are thought to be secure against attacks by both classical and quantum computers. The primary concern is that quantum computers, using algorithms like Shor&amp;rsquo;s Algorithm , could efficiently break widely used public-key cryptosystems such as RSA and Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC), which underpin much of today&amp;rsquo;s secure communication, including TLS. The industry is actively working on standardizing and adopting PQC algorithms. One of the first to be standardized by NIST is the Module-Lattice Key Encapsulation Mechanism ( ML-KEM ), formerly known as Kyber, and now standardized as FIPS-203 (PDF download). It is difficult to predict when quantum computers will be able to break classical algorithms. However, it is clear that we need to start migrating to PQC algorithms now, as the next section shows.

Today, Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (Amazon EKS) announced support for clusters with up to 100,000 nodes. With Amazon EC2’s new generation accelerated computing instance types, this translates to 1. 6 million AWS Trainium chips or 800,000 NVIDIA GPUs in a single Kubernetes cluster. This unlocks ultra scale artificial intelligence (AI) and machine leaning (ML) workloads such as state-of-the-art model training, fine-tuning and agentic inference. Besides customers directly consuming Amazon EKS today, these improvements also extend to other AI/ML services like Amazon SageMaker HyperPod with EKS that leverage EKS as their compute layer, advancing AWS’s overall ultra scale computing capabilities. Our customers have made it clear that containerization of training jobs and operators such as Kubeflow, the ability to streamline resource provisioning and lifecycle through projects like Karpenter, support for pluggable scheduling strategies, and access to a vast ecosystem of cloud-native tools is critical for their success in the AI/ML domain. Kubernetes has emerged as a key enabler here due to its powerful and extensible API model along with robust container orchestration capabilities, allowing accelerated workloads to scale quickly and run reliably. Through multiple technical innovations, architectural improvements and open-source collaboration, Amazon EKS has built the next generation of its cluster control plane and data plane for ultra scale, with full Kubernetes conformance. At AWS, we recommend customers running general-purpose applications with low coupling and horizontal scalability to follow a cell-based architecture as the strategy to sustain growth.</description></item><item><title>Amazon EKS enables ultra scale AI/ML workloads with support for 100K nodes per cluster</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-07-16-amazon-eks-enables-ultra-scale-ai-ml-workloads-with-support-for-100k-nodes-per-c/</link><pubDate>Wed, 16 Jul 2025 00:14:26 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-07-16-amazon-eks-enables-ultra-scale-ai-ml-workloads-with-support-for-100k-nodes-per-c/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Open the original post ↗ &lt;a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/containers/amazon-eks-enables-ultra-scale-ai-ml-workloads-with-support-for-100k-nodes-per-cluster/"&gt;https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/containers/amazon-eks-enables-ultra-scale-ai-ml-workloads-with-support-for-100k-nodes-per-cluster/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Kubernetes v1.33.3</title><link>https://kubermates.org/releases/2025-07-15-kubernetes-v1-33-3/</link><pubDate>Tue, 15 Jul 2025 22:19:31 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/releases/2025-07-15-kubernetes-v1-33-3/</guid><description>See kubernetes-announce@.

By default, the Amazon VPC CNI plugin assigns one IP address to each pod. This IP address is attached to an elastic network interface that handles all incoming and outgoing traffic for the pod. To increase the bandwidth and packet per second rate performance, you can use the Multi-NIC feature of the VPC CNI to configure a multi-homed pod. A multi-homed pod is a single Kubernetes pod that uses multiple network interfaces (and multiple IP addresses). By running a multi-homed pod, you can spread its application traffic across multiple network interfaces by using concurrent connections. This is especially useful for Artificial Intelligence (AI), Machine Learning (ML), and High Performance Computing (HPC) use cases. The following diagram shows a multi-homed pod running on a worker node with multiple network interface cards (NICs) in use. On Amazon EC2, an elastic network interface is a logical networking component in a VPC that represents a virtual network card. For many EC2 instance types, the network interfaces share a single network interface card (NIC) in hardware. This single NIC has a maximum bandwidth and packet per second rate. If the multi-NIC feature is enabled, the VPC CNI doesnât assign IP addresses in bulk, which it does by default.</description></item><item><title>Nirmata Teams Dashboard Gets a Makeover: A Cleaner, Smarter Experience for Managing Kubernetes and Cloud Environments</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-07-15-nirmata-teams-dashboard-gets-a-makeover-a-cleaner-smarter-experience-for-managin/</link><pubDate>Tue, 15 Jul 2025 08:00:09 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-07-15-nirmata-teams-dashboard-gets-a-makeover-a-cleaner-smarter-experience-for-managin/</guid><description>We’re excited to announce a refreshed Teams Dashboard in Nirmata Control Hub. This redesign delivers a cleaner, more intuitive interface that not only looks better, it works better too. Whether you’re managing a few teams or dozens, the new dashboard streamlines how you view and interact with team-related data across your Kubernetes and cloud environments. To improve visibility and team-level accountability, the dashboard now shows how infrastructure resources are allocated across teams. You can easily see which Kubernetes clusters, namespaces, and repositories belong to each team – such as Security, Platform, or Development – and who the team members are. This makes it simpler to understand team footprints, manage access, and align infrastructure usage with organizational structure. Team cards have been completely redesigned with a cleaner layout that makes key information immediately visible. Each card now includes: This update gives you a high-level snapshot of your teams’ footprint across your infrastructure , helping you stay informed at a glance. We’ve improved how policy report assignments are surfaced on each team card, offering better visibility and preparing the groundwork for even more powerful insights and statistics in future releases. Instead of listing all teams on one long scroll, we now paginate the dashboard. You’ll see 12 teams at a time, making navigation faster and more manageable, especially for larger organizations. We’ve also made significant improvements to the Team Details page, focusing on clarity and ease of use.</description></item><item><title>What Is Kubernetes?

Finally, a blog that will explain &amp;ldquo;What is Kubernetes?&amp;rdquo; in very simple words ; an explanation for normal human beings. But Kubernetes is a solution to a problem. And to understand the solution, you first have to look at the problem it solves. Containers, containers, containers… in the voice of Steve Ballmer. You probably heard about Docker. But even if you didn&amp;rsquo;t, it&amp;rsquo;s no big deal to understand it. Docker is a set of tools that allow you to create, edit, and run containers. And a container is just an application in a small little box. What&amp;rsquo;s so cool about containers? Well, one thing is that the application has all that it needs (the so-called dependencies ) inside that little box. So you can take that container, run it on Windows, MacOS, Linux, whatever. It won&amp;rsquo;t complain that stuff is missing.</description></item><item><title>From Raw Data to Model Serving: A Blueprint for the AI/ML Lifecycle with Kubeflow</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-07-15-from-raw-data-to-model-serving-a-blueprint-for-the-ai-ml-lifecycle-with-kubeflow/</link><pubDate>Tue, 15 Jul 2025 00:00:00 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-07-15-from-raw-data-to-model-serving-a-blueprint-for-the-ai-ml-lifecycle-with-kubeflow/</guid><description>Jul 15, 2025 • Helber Belmiro • 22 min read mlops pipelines spark feast model-registry kserve Are you looking for a practical, reproducible way to take a machine learning project from raw data all the way to a deployed, production-ready model? This post is your blueprint for the AI/ML lifecycle: you’ll learn how to use Kubeflow and open source tools such as Feast to build a workflow you can run on your laptop and adapt to your own projects. We’ll walk through the entire ML lifecycle—from data preparation to live inference—leveraging the Kubeflow platform to create a cohesive, production-grade MLOps workflow. The project implements a complete MLOps workflow for a fraud detection use case. Fraud detection is a critical application in financial services, where organizations need to identify potentially fraudulent transactions in real-time while minimizing false positives that could disrupt legitimate customer activity. Our fraud detection system leverages machine learning to analyze large volumes of transaction data, learn patterns from historical behavior, and flag suspicious transactions that deviate from normal patterns. The model considers various features such as transaction amounts, location data, merchant information, and user behavior patterns to make predictions. This makes fraud detection an ideal use case for demonstrating MLOps concepts because it requires: The workflow ingests raw transaction data, proceeds through data preparation and feature engineering, then model training and registration, and finally deploys the model as a production-ready inference service that can evaluate transactions in real-time. The entire workflow is orchestrated as a Kubeflow Pipeline, which provides a powerful framework for defining, deploying, and managing complex machine learning pipelines on Kubernetes. Here is a high-level overview of the pipeline: The pipeline assumes that the initial datasets ( train. csv , test. csv , etc. ) are already available.</description></item><item><title>Kubernetes Monitoring backend 2.2: better cluster observability through new alert and recording rules</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-07-15-kubernetes-monitoring-backend-2-2-better-cluster-observability-through-new-alert/</link><pubDate>Tue, 15 Jul 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-07-15-kubernetes-monitoring-backend-2-2-better-cluster-observability-through-new-alert/</guid><description>Pete Wall Â· 17 Jun 2025 Â· 5 min read Our latest Kubernetes Monitoring Helm chart offers easier, dynamic configuration with Alloy Operator.

This blog post dives into the challenges of managing failure modes when operating pods with devices in Kubernetes, based on insights from Sergey Kanzhelev and Mrunal Patel&amp;rsquo;s talk at KubeCon NA 2024. You can follow the links to slides and recording. The rise of AI/ML workloads has brought new challenges to Kubernetes. These workloads often rely heavily on specialized hardware, and any device failure can significantly impact performance and lead to frustrating interruptions. As highlighted in the 2024 Llama paper , hardware issues, particularly GPU failures, are a major cause of disruption in AI/ML training. You can also learn how much effort NVIDIA spends on handling devices failures and maintenance in the KubeCon talk by Ryan Hallisey and Piotr Prokop All-Your-GPUs-Are-Belong-to-Us: An Inside Look at NVIDIA&amp;rsquo;s Self-Healing GeForce NOW Infrastructure ( recording ) as they see 19 remediation requests per 1000 nodes a day! We also see data centers offering spot consumption models and overcommit on power, making device failures commonplace and a part of the business model. However, Kubernetes’s view on resources is still very static. The resource is either there or not. And if it is there, the assumption is that it will stay there fully functional - Kubernetes lacks good support for handling full or partial hardware failures. These long-existing assumptions combined with the overall complexity of a setup lead to a variety of failure modes, which we discuss here. Generally, all AI/ML workloads require specialized hardware, have challenging scheduling requirements, and are expensive when idle.</description></item><item><title>July 02, 2025</title><link>https://kubermates.org/releases/2025-07-02-july-02-2025/</link><pubDate>Wed, 02 Jul 2025 00:00:00 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/releases/2025-07-02-july-02-2025/</guid><description>This page includes release notes for all channels and releases.

But is your Kyverno setup secure, scalable, and resilient? With the latest enhancement in Nirmata Control Hub , you no longer have to guess. We’re excited to introduce the Kyverno Health Check – a new capability that provides a clear, actionable view of Kyverno’s configuration in your clusters. Whether you’re a platform engineer managing dozens of clusters or a security lead enforcing policy compliance, this feature helps to ensure that Kyverno is running optimally at all times. Kyverno by Nirmata enforces critical security, compliance, and operational policies in Kubernetes. But like any controller, its effectiveness depends on its own configuration and health. A misconfigured or unhealthy Kyverno deployment can : Kyverno Health Check ensures none of this happens by continuously and vigilantly evaluating your deployments for best practices and known risks. The new Kyverno Health Check feature in Nirmata Control Hub evaluates Kyverno deployments based on four critical categories: Each category is scored and flagged as: These results are aggregated into a Kyverno Health Grade (A to F), allowing you to view the overall state of Kyverno at a glance and drill down to address the areas that matter most. In many clusters, Kyverno components may restart frequently or be terminated due to out-of-memory (OOM) conditions. These issues often go unnoticed until policy failures occur. That’s a risk. Nirmata Control Hub detects this and gives you: You or your team can apply the fix, rescan the cluster, and watch your health grade improve.</description></item><item><title>Cut Through the DevSecOps Noise: Smart Violation Prioritization in Nirmata Control Hub</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-06-27-cut-through-the-devsecops-noise-smart-violation-prioritization-in-nirmata-contro/</link><pubDate>Fri, 27 Jun 2025 14:54:55 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-06-27-cut-through-the-devsecops-noise-smart-violation-prioritization-in-nirmata-contro/</guid><description>When managing security and compliance in Kubernetes, it’s easy to get overwhelmed. As a platform engineer or administrator, you might look at your cluster or namespace and find hundreds or even thousands of violations. But not all violations are created equal. Some are critical security risks that demand immediate attention, while others are best practices that can be addressed later. The problem? Without clear guidance, most teams end up doing nothing. Not because they don’t care – but because they don’t know where to start. That’s exactly the problem we solve with Violation Summarization and Prioritization in Nirmata Control Hub. With Nirmata Control Hub, you don’t have to dig through pages of findings and all the time spent therein. With a timely glance, you get a summary report for your entire cluster or specific namespaces, showing: Nirmata Control Hub won’t just tell you what’s wrong. We prioritize violations into clear buckets: This intelligent triage lets your team focus on what matters most – without getting distracted by noise. Every prioritized finding comes with clear remediation suggestions. For example: This built-in guidance significantly reduces the mean time to remediate (MTTR) – especially for large or complex environments.</description></item><item><title>June 27, 2025</title><link>https://kubermates.org/releases/2025-06-27-june-27-2025/</link><pubDate>Fri, 27 Jun 2025 00:00:00 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/releases/2025-06-27-june-27-2025/</guid><description>This page includes release notes for all channels and releases.

An AWS managed policy is a standalone policy that is created and administered by AWS. AWS managed policies are designed to provide permissions for many common use cases so that you can start assigning permissions to users, groups, and roles. Keep in mind that AWS managed policies might not grant least-privilege permissions for your specific use cases because theyâre available for all AWS customers to use. We recommend that you reduce permissions further by defining customer managed policies that are specific to your use cases. You cannot change the permissions defined in AWS managed policies. If AWS updates the permissions defined in an AWS managed policy, the update affects all principal identities (users, groups, and roles) that the policy is attached to. AWS is most likely to update an AWS managed policy when a new AWS service is launched or new API operations become available for existing services. For more information, see AWS managed policies in the IAM User Guide. You can attach the AmazonEKS_CNI_Policy to your IAM entities. Before you create an Amazon EC2 node group, this policy must be attached to either the node IAM role , or to an IAM role thatâs used specifically by the Amazon VPC CNI plugin for Kubernetes. This is so that it can perform actions on your behalf.</description></item><item><title>June 25, 2025</title><link>https://kubermates.org/releases/2025-06-25-june-25-2025/</link><pubDate>Wed, 25 Jun 2025 00:00:00 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/releases/2025-06-25-june-25-2025/</guid><description>This page includes release notes for all channels and releases.

It is common practice to require the use of specific versions of the kernel, its configuration, device drivers, or system components. Despite the existence of the Open Container Initiative (OCI) , a governing community to define standards and specifications for container images, there has been a gap in expression of such compatibility requirements. The need to address this issue has led to different proposals and, ultimately, an implementation in Kubernetes&amp;rsquo; Node Feature Discovery (NFD). NFD is an open source Kubernetes project that automatically detects and reports hardware and system features of cluster nodes. This information helps users to schedule workloads on nodes that meet specific system requirements, which is especially useful for applications with strict hardware or operating system dependencies. A container image is built on a base image, which provides a minimal runtime environment, often a stripped-down Linux userland, completely empty or distroless. When an application requires certain features from the host OS, compatibility issues arise. These dependencies can manifest in several ways: While containers in Kubernetes are the most likely unit of abstraction for these needs, the definition of compatibility can extend further to include other container technologies such as Singularity and other OCI artifacts such as binaries from a spack binary cache. Containerized applications are deployed across various Kubernetes distributions and cloud providers, where different host operating systems introduce compatibility challenges. Often those have to be pre-configured before workload deployment or are immutable. For instance, different cloud providers will include different operating systems like: Each OS comes with unique kernel versions, configurations, and drivers, making compatibility a non-trivial issue for applications requiring specific features.</description></item><item><title>4.20.0-okd-scos.ec.5</title><link>https://kubermates.org/releases/2025-06-24-4-20-0-okd-scos-ec-5/</link><pubDate>Tue, 24 Jun 2025 21:02:12 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/releases/2025-06-24-4-20-0-okd-scos-ec-5/</guid><description>These archives contain the client tooling for OKD on CentOS Stream CoreOS.

They ensure scalability, flexibility, and ease of maintenance by allowing individual services to operate and be updated autonomously. In this guide, we will break down what microservices are, how they operate, their advantages, key components, and best practices, offering a comprehensive overview for anyone looking to understand this modern architectural approach. Microservices are an architectural style that organizes an application as a collection of small, independently deployable services. Unlike traditional monolithic architectures, where a single service encapsulates all functionalities, microservices based applications break down applications into individual services, each focusing on a specific business capability. This modularity allows for independent deployment and scaling, making microservice architecture a popular choice for modern applications, particularly when considering internal microservices. One of the key characteristics of microservices is their cloud-native approach. Each service operates independently but is part of a larger application framework, often utilizing cloud resources to ensure scalability and fault tolerance. This approach not only enhances the flexibility of the system but also promotes the use of a diverse technology stack for different services, allowing teams to choose the best tools for each specific function, including individual microservices. Microservices are designed around bounded contexts, where a consistent domain model applies to a specific area of the application. This ensures that responsibilities are well defined, and each service can focus on a single function within the application. Small, cross-functional teams can manage and develop these services independently, fostering agility and rapid development cycles in a microservices architecture.</description></item><item><title>Blog: Changes to Kubernetes Slack</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-06-16-blog-changes-to-kubernetes-slack/</link><pubDate>Mon, 16 Jun 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-06-16-blog-changes-to-kubernetes-slack/</guid><description>UPDATE : We’ve received notice from Salesforce that our Slack workspace WILL NOT BE DOWNGRADED on June 20th.

This capability ensures your application remains responsive and performs well under varying traffic loads. In this article, we will cover the basics of Kubernetes HPA, how it works, best practices, and a hands-on example to help you master this critical Kubernetes feature. At its core, the Kubernetes Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA) is a Kubernetes resource that automatically adjusts the number of pod replicas based on observed CPU and memory usage metrics. This dynamic adjustment ensures your application maintains stable performance even as traffic fluctuates, making it a critical component for production workloads. Horizontal pod autoscaling HPA operates by continuously monitoring specified metrics and making scaling decisions to match the demand. The HPA utilizes resource metrics like CPU and memory, as well as custom metrics and cpu metrics, to determine the appropriate number of replicas needed. For example, if the average CPU utilization exceeds a predefined threshold, HPA will increase the number of replicas to distribute the load. Conversely, when the demand decreases, HPA reduces the number of replicas, optimizing resource usage and reducing costs. Additionally, the custom metrics api can be leveraged to enhance monitoring capabilities. This automatic scaling mechanism helps maintain application performance and reliability without manual intervention and automatically scales. Understanding how the Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA) operates is crucial for leveraging its full potential.</description></item><item><title>kubectl logs: How to Get Pod Logs in Kubernetes (With Examples)</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-06-14-kubectl-logs-how-to-get-pod-logs-in-kubernetes-with-examples/</link><pubDate>Sat, 14 Jun 2025 14:09:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-06-14-kubectl-logs-how-to-get-pod-logs-in-kubernetes-with-examples/</guid><description>Kubernetes is a container orchestration tool used to deploy and manage containerized applications. Like any software, these applications can sometimes fail or not perform as expected due to various reasons. When such failures occur, it’s important to identify and rectify the issue quickly. One key aspect of troubleshooting involves analyzing the application logs, which can provide valuable information about the root cause of the problem. Logs are essentially records of events happening within your application. By examining these logs, we can often gain insights into what went wrong. In this blog post, we’ll learn how to access Pod logs in Kubernetes using the kubectl logs command. Note that when we say Pod logs, we’re generally referring to the logs of the applications running in containers inside the Pod. To easily follow along with the examples in this post, we recommend using KodeKloud’s Kubernetes playground. This playground will provide you instant access to a running Kubernetes cluster with kubectl already installed. No need for you to install any software.

Amazon EKS Node Classes are templates that offer granular control over the configuration of your EKS Auto Mode managed nodes. A Node Class defines infrastructure-level settings that apply to groups of nodes in your EKS cluster, including network configuration, storage settings, and resource tagging. This topic explains how to create and configure a Node Class to meet your specific operational requirements. When you need to customize how EKS Auto Mode provisions and configures EC2 instances beyond the default settings, creating a Node Class gives you precise control over critical infrastructure parameters. For example, you can specify private subnet placement for enhanced security, configure instance ephemeral storage for performance-sensitive workloads, or apply custom tagging for cost allocation. To create a NodeClass , follow these steps: Create a YAML file (for example, nodeclass. yaml ) with your Node Class configuration Apply the configuration to your cluster using kubectl Reference the Node Class in your Node Pool configuration. For more information, see Create a Node Pool for EKS Auto Mode. You need kubectl installed and configured. For more information, see Set up to use Amazon EKS.

When running applications on Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (Amazon EKS), you might need to access AWS resources that exist in different AWS accounts. This guide shows you how to set up cross account access using EKS Pod Identity, which enables your Kubernetes pods to access other AWS resources using target roles. Before you begin, ensure you have completed the following steps: Set up the Amazon EKS Pod Identity Agent Create an EKS Pod Identity role Pod Identity enables applications in your EKS cluster to access AWS resources across accounts through a process called role chaining. When creating a Pod Identity association, you can provide two IAM roles: an EKS Pod Identity role in the same account as your EKS cluster and a Target IAM Role from the account containing your AWS resources you wish to access, (like S3 buckets or RDS Databases). The EKS Pod Identity role must be in your EKS clusterâs account due to IAM PassRole requirements, while the Target IAM Role can be in any AWS account. PassRole enables an AWS entity to delegate role assumption to another service. EKS Pod Identity uses PassRole to connect a role to a Kubernetes service account, requiring both the role and the identity passing it to be in the same AWS account as the EKS cluster. When your application pod needs to access AWS resources, it requests credentials from Pod Identity. Pod Identity then automatically performs two role assumptions in sequence: first assuming the EKS Pod Identity role , then using those credentials to assume the Target IAM Role. This process provides your pod with temporary credentials that have the permissions defined in the target role, allowing secure access to resources in other AWS accounts. Due to caching mechanisms, updates to an IAM role in an existing Pod Identity association may not take effect immediately in the pods running on your EKS cluster.</description></item><item><title>K3s vs K8s: What are the Differences &amp; Use Cases</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-06-10-k3s-vs-k8s-what-are-the-differences-use-cases/</link><pubDate>Tue, 10 Jun 2025 07:48:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-06-10-k3s-vs-k8s-what-are-the-differences-use-cases/</guid><description>When it comes to container orchestration, K8s (Kubernetes) has become a de facto standard for managing applications and infrastructure at scale across on-premise data centres and public clouds. But as organizations look to deploy containerized workloads to devices at the edge of their network or for Internet of Things (IoT) applications, the full Kubernetes distribution can be overkill. This is where K3s comes in. Developed by Rancher Labs, K3s is a lightweight Kubernetes distribution designed specifically for resource-constrained edge and IoT environments. In this article, we&amp;rsquo;ll explain the key differences between K3s and the upstream Kubernetes project to help you understand when each makes the most sense for your application architecture and deployment needs. Try the Kubernetes Deployments Lab for free. Kubernetes is an open-source container orchestration platform that automates the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications. It allows you to define your application&amp;rsquo;s desired state and ensures that it runs consistently in a cluster of machines. Kubernetes automates tasks such as load balancing, self-healing, and scaling, making it easier to manage and maintain container-based applications. It has become the industry standard for container orchestration, simplifying the management of complex, distributed applications.

This blog post explores how to build custom event aggregation systems that help engineering teams better understand cluster behavior and troubleshoot issues more effectively. In a Kubernetes cluster, events are generated for various operations - from pod scheduling and container starts to volume mounts and network configurations. While these events are invaluable for debugging and monitoring, several challenges emerge in production environments: To learn more about Events in Kubernetes, read the Event API reference. Consider a production environment with tens of microservices where the users report intermittent transaction failures: Traditional event aggregation process: Engineers are wasting hours sifting through thousands of standalone events spread across namespaces. By the time they look into it, the older events have long since purged, and correlating pod restarts to node-level issues is practically impossible. With its event aggregation in its custom events: The system groups events across resources, instantly surfacing correlation patterns such as volume mount timeouts before pod restarts. History indicates it occurred during past record traffic spikes, highlighting a storage scalability issue in minutes rather than hours. The beneﬁt of this approach is that organizations that implement it commonly cut down their troubleshooting time significantly along with increasing the reliability of systems by detecting patterns early. This post explores how to build a custom event aggregation system that addresses these challenges, aligned to Kubernetes best practices. I&amp;rsquo;ve picked the Go programming language for my example. This event aggregation system consists of three main components: Here&amp;rsquo;s a sketch for how to implement the event watcher: The event processor enriches events with additional context and classification: One of the key features you could implement is a way of correlating related Events.</description></item><item><title>Should I Use Kubernetes?</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-06-07-should-i-use-kubernetes/</link><pubDate>Sat, 07 Jun 2025 07:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-06-07-should-i-use-kubernetes/</guid><description>In the DevOps world, container orchestration is often synonymous with Kubernetes, a platform for deploying and managing container-based workloads in production. Since its debut in 2014, Kubernetes has seen a meteoric rise in its adoption and popularity. Despite being a relatively new technology, it is now used by a vast number of organizations, from small start-ups to large enterprises, so much so that it has become a standard in the industry. Kubernetes benefits from strong community support and boasts a rich ecosystem of tools and extensions. It is continuously being developed and improved, and judging by the current trends, Kubernetes is only going to get stronger in the future. In this blog post, we’ll discuss why you should consider using Kubernetes , scenarios where Kubernetes might not be the ideal solution, and explore some of its alternatives. Let’s get started! Kubernetes offers several key features that cater to a wide range of application deployment and management needs. Here are the top three features of Kubernetes that make it particularly suitable for modern software development: In recent years, the microservices approach ( where software systems are developed as a collection of small, independent services ) has become increasingly popular in software development. Kubernetes provides many abstractions and APIs that are particularly well-suited to the requirements and characteristics of a microservices architecture. Here&amp;rsquo;s how Kubernetes simplifies the deployment and management of microservices: One of the standout features of Kubernetes is its ability to auto-scale applications in response to fluctuating traffic demands. When production systems experience spikes or drops in traffic, Kubernetes seamlessly steps in to adjust resources. It achieves this through two key scaling strategies: In addition to horizontal and vertical scaling, Kubernetes excels in cloud-based scalability, using a feature known as the Cluster Autoscaler.</description></item><item><title>Amazon EKS AWS Region expansion</title><link>https://kubermates.org/releases/2025-06-06-amazon-eks-aws-region-expansion/</link><pubDate>Fri, 06 Jun 2025 19:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/releases/2025-06-06-amazon-eks-aws-region-expansion/</guid><description>Help improve this page To contribute to this user guide, choose the Edit this page on GitHub link that is located in the right pane of every page.

This topic helps you to enable private access for your Amazon EKS clusterâs Kubernetes API server endpoint and limit, or completely disable, public access from the internet. When you create a new cluster, Amazon EKS creates an endpoint for the managed Kubernetes API server that you use to communicate with your cluster (using Kubernetes management tools such as kubectl ). By default, this API server endpoint is public to the internet, and access to the API server is secured using a combination of AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) and native Kubernetes Role Based Access Control (RBAC). This endpoint is known as the cluster public endpoint. Also there is a cluster private endpoint. For more information about the cluster private endpoint, see the following section Cluster private endpoint. EKS creates a unique dual-stack endpoint in the following format for new IPv6 clusters that are made after October 2024. An IPv6 cluster is a cluster that you select IPv6 in the IP family ( ipFamily ) setting of the cluster.

Unlike typical short-lived, stateless web requests, LLM inference sessions are often long-running, resource-intensive, and partially stateful. For example, a single GPU-backed model server may keep multiple inference sessions active and maintain in-memory token caches. Traditional load balancers focused on HTTP path or round-robin lack the specialized capabilities needed for these workloads. They also don’t account for model identity or request criticality (e. g. , interactive chat vs. batch jobs). Organizations often patch together ad-hoc solutions, but a standardized approach is missing. Gateway API Inference Extension was created to address this gap by building on the existing Gateway API , adding inference-specific routing capabilities while retaining the familiar model of Gateways and HTTPRoutes. By adding an inference extension to your existing gateway, you effectively transform it into an Inference Gateway , enabling you to self-host GenAI/LLMs with a “model-as-a-service” mindset. The project’s goal is to improve and standardize routing to inference workloads across the ecosystem.</description></item><item><title>Start Sidecar First: How To Avoid Snags</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-06-03-start-sidecar-first-how-to-avoid-snags/</link><pubDate>Tue, 03 Jun 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-06-03-start-sidecar-first-how-to-avoid-snags/</guid><description>From the Kubernetes Multicontainer Pods: An Overview blog post you know what their job is, what are the main architectural patterns, and how they are implemented in Kubernetes.

Hosted by Eric Durmishi and presented by Kyverno maintainers Mariam Fahmy and Charles Edward, the session introduced exciting new capabilities that enhance Kyverno’s flexibility and consistency as a policy engine for Kubernetes. At its core, Kyverno is a policy engine for Kubernetes. It enables you to define policies for validating, mutating, generating, or verifying images for resources within your cluster. When an API request, like creating a Pod, is sent to the Kubernetes API server, it passes through several stages, including authentication and authorization. Kyverno integrates as an admission webhook. The API request is forwarded to the Kyverno server, which fetches relevant policies, applies them to the resource, and then either accepts or rejects the request based on whether the resource violates the policy. Kyverno also includes components such as the Reports Controller, which generates policy reports to visualize policy results, and a Cleanup Controller, which manages unused resources based on cleanup policies. Traditionally, Kyverno used a single policy type with different rule types nested within it, such as validate, mutate, generate, and verifyImages. Policies could define rules to match or exclude specific resources. For validation, you could use patterns, deny rules, Pod Security subrules, or assertion trees.</description></item><item><title>No More kubectl Commands — Just Talk to Your Kubernetes Cluster in Natural Language</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-05-28-no-more-kubectl-commands-just-talk-to-your-kubernetes-cluster-in-natural-languag/</link><pubDate>Wed, 28 May 2025 17:52:01 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-05-28-no-more-kubectl-commands-just-talk-to-your-kubernetes-cluster-in-natural-languag/</guid><description>What if you could just ask: &amp;raquo;&amp;gt; how&amp;rsquo;s my nginx app doing? …and your terminal figured out the rest? Thanks to kubectl-ai , Kubernetes can now understand natural language. You type what you want in plain English, and it responds by executing real, context-aware kubectl commands — without needing to memorize flags, write YAML, or guess namespaces. Let’s explore how this works in action. Before you can chat with your cluster, make sure you have the basics in place: The fastest way (Linux &amp;amp; macOS): Skip the manual steps and install in one line: curl -sSL https://raw. githubusercontent. com/GoogleCloudPlatform/kubectl-ai/main/install. sh | bash You’ll be ready to talk to your cluster in under a minute. Prefer to do it yourself? Manual install (Linux, macOS, Windows): Already a kubectl power user? Install with Krew (Linux/macOS/Windows): If you use Krew (the plugin manager for kubectl), installation is a breeze: Now, just invoke it as a kubectl plugin: No matter which method you choose, you’ll be ready to type natural language commands and let kubectl-ai handle the rest. No more memorizing flags, no more YAML wrangling—just pure, conversational Kubernetes. Ready to see kubectl-ai in action? Now that setup is out of the way, it’s time to experience the magic of conversational Kubernetes firsthand. Let’s dive in: Instead of juggling flags and memorizing resource names, just type your question—kubectl-ai will handle the rest. Note: The following examples are run on a Windows system using the OpenAI GPT-4o model, but kubectl-ai works just as smoothly across platforms and with other LLM providers.</description></item><item><title>May 27, 2025</title><link>https://kubermates.org/releases/2025-05-27-may-27-2025/</link><pubDate>Tue, 27 May 2025 00:00:00 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/releases/2025-05-27-may-27-2025/</guid><description>This page includes release notes for all channels and releases.

This marks a significant milestone in making resource management for Kubernetes workloads more flexible and less disruptive. Traditionally, changing the CPU or memory resources allocated to a container required restarting the Pod. While acceptable for many stateless applications, this could be disruptive for stateful services, batch jobs, or any workloads sensitive to restarts. In-place Pod resizing allows you to change the CPU and memory requests and limits assigned to containers within a running Pod, often without requiring a container restart. Here&amp;rsquo;s the core idea: You can try it out on a v1. 33 Kubernetes cluster by using kubectl to edit a Pod (requires kubectl v1. 32+): For detailed usage instructions and examples, please refer to the official Kubernetes documentation: Resize CPU and Memory Resources assigned to Containers. Kubernetes still excels at scaling workloads horizontally (adding or removing replicas), but in-place Pod resizing unlocks several key benefits for vertical scaling: Since the alpha release in v1. 27, significant work has gone into maturing the feature, improving its stability, and refining the user experience based on feedback and further development. Here are the key changes: Graduating to Beta means the feature is ready for broader adoption, but development doesn&amp;rsquo;t stop here!

In batch workloads, you might want to use leader-follower patterns like MPI , in which the leader controls the execution, including the followers&amp;rsquo; lifecycle. In this case, you might want to mark it as succeeded even if some of the indexes failed. Unfortunately, a leader-follower Kubernetes Job that didn&amp;rsquo;t use a success policy, in most cases, would have to require all Pods to finish successfully for that Job to reach an overall succeeded state. For Kubernetes Jobs, the API allows you to specify the early exit criteria using the. spec. successPolicy field (you can only use the. spec. successPolicy field for an indexed Job ). Which describes a set of rules either using a list of succeeded indexes for a job, or defining a minimal required size of succeeded indexes. This newly stable field is especially valuable for scientific simulation, AI/ML and High-Performance Computing (HPC) batch workloads.</description></item><item><title>Kubernetes v1.33: Updates to Container Lifecycle</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-05-14-kubernetes-v1-33-updates-to-container-lifecycle/</link><pubDate>Wed, 14 May 2025 10:30:00 -0800</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-05-14-kubernetes-v1-33-updates-to-container-lifecycle/</guid><description>Kubernetes v1. 33 introduces a few updates to the lifecycle of containers. The Sleep action for container lifecycle hooks now supports a zero sleep duration (feature enabled by default). There is also alpha support for customizing the stop signal sent to containers when they are being terminated. This blog post goes into the details of these new aspects of the container lifecycle, and how you can use them. Kubernetes v1. 29 introduced the Sleep action for container PreStop and PostStart Lifecycle hooks. The Sleep action lets your containers pause for a specified duration after the container is started or before it is terminated. This was needed to provide a straightforward way to manage graceful shutdowns. Before the Sleep action, folks used to run the sleep command using the exec action in their container lifecycle hooks. If you wanted to do this you&amp;rsquo;d need to have the binary for the sleep command in your container image. This is difficult if you&amp;rsquo;re using third party images.</description></item><item><title>Automate Policy Violation Tracking with Jira in Nirmata Control Hub</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-05-14-automate-policy-violation-tracking-with-jira-in-nirmata-control-hub/</link><pubDate>Wed, 14 May 2025 10:08:17 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-05-14-automate-policy-violation-tracking-with-jira-in-nirmata-control-hub/</guid><description>Keeping track of Kubernetes policy violations across namespaces and clusters can be tedious, especially when teams rely on disconnected tools and manual workflows. With Nirmata Control Hub’s Jira integration, you can automatically or manually create Jira tickets for policy violations directly from the platform. This ensures accountability, reduces MTTR (mean time to resolution), and improves team productivity by embedding policy compliance into your teams’ tools. Every misconfiguration or policy violation is a potential security or compliance risk. However, identifying issues is only the first step. The real value is in closing the loop—from detection to resolution. Traditionally, teams rely on Slack alerts, dashboards, or Excel exports to track violations. But these quickly fall out of sync with what’s happening in the cluster or Git. Hira is where real work happens, and that’s where Nirmata Control Hub (NCH) now meets your team. From any Policy Reports page, users can instantly generate a Jira issue for violations. Simply click “Create Jira Issue” and fill in the ticket details, such as project, title, issue type, priority, and assignee. This creates traceability right at the source of the ossie, whether it;s a misconfigured deployment, a missing securityContext, or a policy deviation.</description></item><item><title>Why Policy as Code is a Game Changer for Platform Engineers</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-05-13-why-policy-as-code-is-a-game-changer-for-platform-engineers/</link><pubDate>Tue, 13 May 2025 20:07:21 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-05-13-why-policy-as-code-is-a-game-changer-for-platform-engineers/</guid><description>Platform engineers, let’s talk about a fundamental shift that’s revolutionizing how we build and manage internal developer platforms: Policy as Code (PaC). This isn’t just another buzzword; it’s the key to creating scalable, secure, and efficient operations that empower developers. Let’s dive in! Platform engineers, let’s talk about a fundamental shift that’s revolutionizing how we build and manage internal developer platforms: Policy as Code (PaC). This isn’t just another buzzword; it’s the key to creating scalable, secure, and efficient operations that empower developers. Let’s dive in! Policy as Code drastically improves developer experience. By implementing policy checks early in the development process (“shifting left”), developers get instant feedback on potential issues. This prevents problems from reaching production and reduces mental load, allowing them to focus on innovation, not compliance headaches. Platform engineering is about giving developers self-service capabilities. Infrastructure as Code (IaC) provides automation, but Policy as Code (PaC) provides the critical guardrails. Developers can provision resources and deploy applications within defined “golden paths,” ensuring agility without compromising security or compliance. Policies written as code are stored in version control, creating a clear history of changes. This auditability is essential for troubleshooting and demonstrating compliance.</description></item><item><title>Kubernetes v1.33: Job's Backoff Limit Per Index Goes GA</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-05-13-kubernetes-v1-33-job-s-backoff-limit-per-index-goes-ga/</link><pubDate>Tue, 13 May 2025 10:30:00 -0800</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-05-13-kubernetes-v1-33-job-s-backoff-limit-per-index-goes-ga/</guid><description>In Kubernetes v1. 33, the Backoff Limit Per Index feature reaches general availability (GA). This blog describes the Backoff Limit Per Index feature and its benefits. When you run workloads on Kubernetes, you must consider scenarios where Pod failures can affect the completion of your workloads. Ideally, your workload should tolerate transient failures and continue running. To achieve failure tolerance in a Kubernetes Job, you can set the spec. backoffLimit field. This field specifies the total number of tolerated failures. However, for workloads where every index is considered independent, like embarassingly parallel workloads - the spec. backoffLimit field is often not flexible enough. For example, you may choose to run multiple suites of integration tests by representing each suite as an index within an Indexed Job. In that setup, a fast-failing index (test suite) is likely to consume your entire budget for tolerating Pod failures, and you might not be able to run the other indexes.</description></item><item><title>May 13, 2025</title><link>https://kubermates.org/releases/2025-05-13-may-13-2025/</link><pubDate>Tue, 13 May 2025 00:00:00 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/releases/2025-05-13-may-13-2025/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Open the original post ↗ &lt;a href="https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/release-notes#May_13_2025"&gt;https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/release-notes#May_13_2025&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Kubernetes v1.33: Image Pull Policy the way you always thought it worked!</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-05-12-kubernetes-v1-33-image-pull-policy-the-way-you-always-thought-it-worked/</link><pubDate>Mon, 12 May 2025 10:30:00 -0800</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-05-12-kubernetes-v1-33-image-pull-policy-the-way-you-always-thought-it-worked/</guid><description>Some things in Kubernetes are surprising, and the way imagePullPolicy behaves might be one of them. Given Kubernetes is all about running pods, it may be peculiar to learn that there has been a caveat to restricting pod access to authenticated images for over 10 years in the form of issue 18787 ! It is an exciting release when you can resolve a ten-year-old issue. The gist of the problem is that the imagePullPolicy: IfNotPresent strategy has done precisely what it says, and nothing more. Let&amp;rsquo;s set up a scenario. To begin, Pod A in Namespace X is scheduled to Node 1 and requires image Foo from a private repository. For it&amp;rsquo;s image pull authentication material, the pod references Secret 1 in its imagePullSecrets. Secret 1 contains the necessary credentials to pull from the private repository. The Kubelet will utilize the credentials from Secret 1 as supplied by Pod A and it will pull container image Foo from the registry. This is the intended (and secure) behavior. But now things get curious. If Pod B in Namespace Y happens to also be scheduled to Node 1 , unexpected (and potentially insecure) things happen. Pod B may reference the same private image, specifying the IfNotPresent image pull policy.</description></item><item><title>Kubernetes v1.33: Streaming List responses</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-05-09-kubernetes-v1-33-streaming-list-responses/</link><pubDate>Fri, 09 May 2025 10:30:00 -0800</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-05-09-kubernetes-v1-33-streaming-list-responses/</guid><description>Managing Kubernetes cluster stability becomes increasingly critical as your infrastructure grows. One of the most challenging aspects of operating large-scale clusters has been handling List requests that fetch substantial datasets - a common operation that could unexpectedly impact your cluster&amp;rsquo;s stability. Today, the Kubernetes community is excited to announce a significant architectural improvement: streaming encoding for List responses. Current API response encoders just serialize an entire response into a single contiguous memory and perform one ResponseWriter. Write call to transmit data to the client. Despite HTTP/2&amp;rsquo;s capability to split responses into smaller frames for transmission, the underlying HTTP server continues to hold the complete response data as a single buffer. Even as individual frames are transmitted to the client, the memory associated with these frames cannot be freed incrementally. When cluster size grows, the single response body can be substantial - like hundreds of megabytes in size. At large scale, the current approach becomes particularly inefficient, as it prevents incremental memory release during transmission. Imagining that when network congestion occurs, that large response body’s memory block stays active for tens of seconds or even minutes. This limitation leads to unnecessarily high and prolonged memory consumption in the kube-apiserver process. If multiple large List requests occur simultaneously, the cumulative memory consumption can escalate rapidly, potentially leading to an Out-of-Memory (OOM) situation that compromises cluster stability.</description></item><item><title>Kubernetes 1.33: Volume Populators Graduate to GA</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-05-08-kubernetes-1-33-volume-populators-graduate-to-ga/</link><pubDate>Thu, 08 May 2025 10:30:00 -0800</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-05-08-kubernetes-1-33-volume-populators-graduate-to-ga/</guid><description>Kubernetes volume populators are now generally available (GA)! The AnyVolumeDataSource feature gate is treated as always enabled for Kubernetes v1. 33, which means that users can specify any appropriate custom resource as the data source of a PersistentVolumeClaim (PVC). An example of how to use dataSourceRef in PVC: There are four major enhancements from beta. During the beta phase, contributors to Kubernetes identified potential resource leaks with PersistentVolumeClaim (PVC) deletion while volume population was in progress; these leaks happened due to limitations in finalizer handling. Ahead of the graduation to general availability, the Kubernetes project added support to delete temporary resources (PVC prime, etc. ) if the original PVC is deleted. To accommodate this, we&amp;rsquo;ve introduced three new plugin-based functions: A provider example is added in lib-volume-populator/example. For GA, the CSI volume populator controller code gained a MutatorConfig , allowing the specification of mutator functions to modify Kubernetes resources. For example, if the PVC prime is not an exact copy of the PVC and you need provider-specific information for the driver, you can include this information in the optional MutatorConfig. This allows you to customize the Kubernetes objects in the volume populator. Our beta phase highlighted a new requirement: the need to aggregate metrics not just from lib-volume-populator, but also from other components within the provider&amp;rsquo;s codebase. To address this, SIG Storage introduced a provider metric manager.</description></item><item><title>Kubernetes v1.33: From Secrets to Service Accounts: Kubernetes Image Pulls Evolved</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-05-07-kubernetes-v1-33-from-secrets-to-service-accounts-kubernetes-image-pulls-evolved/</link><pubDate>Wed, 07 May 2025 10:30:00 -0800</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-05-07-kubernetes-v1-33-from-secrets-to-service-accounts-kubernetes-image-pulls-evolved/</guid><description>Kubernetes has steadily evolved to reduce reliance on long-lived credentials stored in the API. A prime example of this shift is the transition of Kubernetes Service Account (KSA) tokens from long-lived, static tokens to ephemeral, automatically rotated tokens with OpenID Connect (OIDC)-compliant semantics. This advancement enables workloads to securely authenticate with external services without needing persistent secrets. However, one major gap remains: image pull authentication. Today, Kubernetes clusters rely on image pull secrets stored in the API, which are long-lived and difficult to rotate, or on node-level kubelet credential providers, which allow any pod running on a node to access the same credentials. This presents security and operational challenges. To address this, Kubernetes is introducing Service Account Token Integration for Kubelet Credential Providers , now available in alpha. This enhancement allows credential providers to use pod-specific service account tokens to obtain registry credentials, which kubelet can then use for image pulls — eliminating the need for long-lived image pull secrets. Currently, Kubernetes administrators have two primary options for handling private container image pulls: Image pull secrets stored in the Kubernetes API Kubelet credential providers Neither approach aligns with the principles of least privilege or ephemeral authentication , leaving Kubernetes with a security gap. This new enhancement enables kubelet credential providers to use workload identity when fetching image registry credentials. Instead of relying on long-lived secrets, credential providers can use service account tokens to request short-lived credentials tied to a specific pod’s identity. This approach provides: Kubelet generates short-lived, automatically rotated tokens for service accounts if the credential provider it communicates with has opted into receiving a service account token for image pulls.</description></item><item><title>Do You Need a Degree to Be a DevOps Engineer?

This feature enables to implement more precise control over supplemental groups in containers that can strengthen the security posture, particularly in accessing volumes. Moreover, it also enhances the transparency of UID/GID details in containers, offering improved security oversight. Please be aware that this beta release contains some behavioral breaking change. See The Behavioral Changes Introduced In Beta and Upgrade Considerations sections for details. Although the majority of Kubernetes cluster admins/users may not be aware, kubernetes, by default, merges group information from the Pod with information defined in /etc/group in the container image. Let&amp;rsquo;s see an example, below Pod manifest specifies runAsUser=1000 , runAsGroup=3000 and supplementalGroups=4000 in the Pod&amp;rsquo;s security context. What is the result of id command in the ctr container? The output should be similar to this: Where does group ID 50000 in supplementary groups ( groups field) come from, even though 50000 is not defined in the Pod&amp;rsquo;s manifest at all? The answer is /etc/group file in the container image. Checking the contents of /etc/group in the container image should show below: This shows that the container&amp;rsquo;s primary user 1000 belongs to the group 50000 in the last entry. Thus, the group membership defined in /etc/group in the container image for the container&amp;rsquo;s primary user is implicitly merged to the information from the Pod.</description></item><item><title>Nirmata’s AI-Powered Remediations: A Smarter Way to Fix Policy Violations</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-05-06-nirmata-s-ai-powered-remediations-a-smarter-way-to-fix-policy-violations/</link><pubDate>Tue, 06 May 2025 18:25:24 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-05-06-nirmata-s-ai-powered-remediations-a-smarter-way-to-fix-policy-violations/</guid><description>Every modern enterprise strives for faster software delivery without compromising on security and compliance. As cloud-native environments grow in scale and complexity, so does the burden of identifying and fixing misconfigurations across clusters, pipelines, and cloud infrastructure. Today, we’re excited to announce a major leap forward in our mission to simplify cloud governance: AI-Powered Remediations , which is now available in preview in Nirmata Control Hub (NCH). Security and platform teams often face a growing backlog of policy violations—from missing labels to insecure container configurations to overly permissive network rules. Manually investigating each violation, understanding its root cause, and crafting a compliant fix takes time—and that time adds up. With AI Remediations, we’re dramatically reducing the Mean Time to Remediation (MTTR ). Instead of spending hours chasing down documentation or writing YAML from scratch, teams can now review and apply context-aware fixes in minutes. And the benefits go beyond speed: Whether it’s a Deployment, ConfigMap, NetworkPolicy, or any Kubernetes resource, if it violates a rule enforced by your Kyverno policies in NCH, we can generate a fix. Here’s how: Transparency by design: We don’t just tell you what to change – we explain why. You stay in control, with the ability to test and validate before deployment. AI Remediations aren’t about removing humans from the loop—they’re about giving your teams a smarter starting point. Think of them as policy-aware code suggestions that plug right into your existing workflows.</description></item><item><title>Kubernetes v1.33: Prevent PersistentVolume Leaks When Deleting out of Order graduates to GA</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-05-05-kubernetes-v1-33-prevent-persistentvolume-leaks-when-deleting-out-of-order-gradu/</link><pubDate>Mon, 05 May 2025 10:30:00 -0800</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-05-05-kubernetes-v1-33-prevent-persistentvolume-leaks-when-deleting-out-of-order-gradu/</guid><description>I am thrilled to announce that the feature to prevent PersistentVolume (or PVs for short) leaks when deleting out of order has graduated to General Availability (GA) in Kubernetes v1. 33! This improvement, initially introduced as a beta feature in Kubernetes v1. 31, ensures that your storage resources are properly reclaimed, preventing unwanted leaks. PersistentVolumeClaim (or PVC for short) is a user&amp;rsquo;s request for storage. A PV and PVC are considered Bound if a newly created PV or a matching PV is found. The PVs themselves are backed by volumes allocated by the storage backend. Normally, if the volume is to be deleted, then the expectation is to delete the PVC for a bound PV-PVC pair. However, there are no restrictions on deleting a PV before deleting a PVC. For a Bound PV-PVC pair, the ordering of PV-PVC deletion determines whether the PV reclaim policy is honored. The reclaim policy is honored if the PVC is deleted first; however, if the PV is deleted prior to deleting the PVC, then the reclaim policy is not exercised. As a result of this behavior, the associated storage asset in the external infrastructure is not removed. With the graduation to GA in Kubernetes v1.</description></item><item><title>Nirmata Enterprise for Kyverno (N4K) Now Available on AWS Marketplace!</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-05-05-nirmata-enterprise-for-kyverno-n4k-now-available-on-aws-marketplace/</link><pubDate>Mon, 05 May 2025 17:55:11 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-05-05-nirmata-enterprise-for-kyverno-n4k-now-available-on-aws-marketplace/</guid><description>We are thrilled to announce that Nirmata Enterprise for Kyverno (N4K) is now available on AWS Marketplace !

Kubernetes v1. 33 introduces an alpha feature called mutable CSI node allocatable count , allowing Container Storage Interface (CSI) drivers to dynamically update the reported maximum number of volumes that a node can handle. This capability significantly enhances the accuracy of pod scheduling decisions and reduces scheduling failures caused by outdated volume capacity information. Traditionally, Kubernetes CSI drivers report a static maximum volume attachment limit when initializing. However, actual attachment capacities can change during a node&amp;rsquo;s lifecycle for various reasons, such as: Static reporting can cause Kubernetes to schedule pods onto nodes that appear to have capacity but don&amp;rsquo;t, leading to pods stuck in a ContainerCreating state. With the new feature gate MutableCSINodeAllocatableCount , Kubernetes enables CSI drivers to dynamically adjust and report node attachment capacities at runtime. This ensures that the scheduler has the most accurate, up-to-date view of node capacity. When this feature is enabled, Kubernetes supports two mechanisms for updating the reported node volume limits: To use this alpha feature, you must enable the MutableCSINodeAllocatableCount feature gate in these components: Below is an example of configuring a CSI driver to enable periodic updates every 60 seconds: This configuration directs Kubelet to periodically call the CSI driver&amp;rsquo;s NodeGetInfo method every 60 seconds, updating the node’s allocatable volume count. Kubernetes enforces a minimum update interval of 10 seconds to balance accuracy and resource usage. In addition to periodic updates, Kubernetes now reacts to attachment failures. Specifically, if a volume attachment fails with a ResourceExhausted error (gRPC code 8 ), an immediate update is triggered to correct the allocatable count promptly.</description></item><item><title>Kubernetes v1.33: New features in DRA</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-05-01-kubernetes-v1-33-new-features-in-dra/</link><pubDate>Thu, 01 May 2025 10:30:00 -0800</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-05-01-kubernetes-v1-33-new-features-in-dra/</guid><description>Kubernetes Dynamic Resource Allocation (DRA) was originally introduced as an alpha feature in the v1. 26 release, and then went through a significant redesign for Kubernetes v1. 31. The main DRA feature went to beta in v1. 32, and the project hopes it will be generally available in Kubernetes v1. 34. The basic feature set of DRA provides a far more powerful and flexible API for requesting devices than Device Plugin. And while DRA remains a beta feature for v1. 33, the DRA team has been hard at work implementing a number of new features and UX improvements. One feature has been promoted to beta, while a number of new features have been added in alpha. The team has also made progress towards getting DRA ready for GA.

This feature adds a scoring method for pod scheduling with the topology-aware volume provisioning. This feature eases to schedule pods on nodes with either the most or least available storage capacity. This feature extends the kube-scheduler&amp;rsquo;s VolumeBinding plugin to perform scoring using node storage capacity information obtained from Storage Capacity. Currently, you can only filter out nodes with insufficient storage capacity. So, you have to use a scheduler extender to achieve storage-capacity-based pod scheduling. This feature is useful for provisioning node-local PVs, which have size limits based on the node&amp;rsquo;s storage capacity. By using this feature, you can assign the PVs to the nodes with the most available storage space so that you can expand the PVs later as much as possible. In another use case, you might want to reduce the number of nodes as much as possible for low operation costs in cloud environments by choosing the least storage capacity node. This feature helps maximize resource utilization by filling up nodes more sequentially, starting with the most utilized nodes first that still have enough storage capacity for the requested volume size. In the alpha phase, StorageCapacityScoring is disabled by default.</description></item><item><title>Bottlerocket for hybrid nodes</title><link>https://kubermates.org/releases/2025-04-29-bottlerocket-for-hybrid-nodes/</link><pubDate>Tue, 29 Apr 2025 19:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/releases/2025-04-29-bottlerocket-for-hybrid-nodes/</guid><description>Help improve this page To contribute to this user guide, choose the Edit this page on GitHub link that is located in the right pane of every page.

Horizontal Pod Autoscaling is a well-known Kubernetes feature that allows your workload to automatically resize by adding or removing replicas based on resource utilization. Let&amp;rsquo;s say you have a web application running in a Kubernetes cluster with 50 replicas. You configure the HorizontalPodAutoscaler (HPA) to scale based on CPU utilization, with a target of 75% utilization. Now, imagine that the current CPU utilization across all replicas is 90%, which is higher than the desired 75%. The HPA will calculate the required number of replicas using the formula: In this example: So, the HPA will increase the number of replicas from 50 to 60 to reduce the load on each pod. Similarly, if the CPU utilization were to drop below 75%, the HPA would scale down the number of replicas accordingly. The Kubernetes documentation provides a detailed description of the scaling algorithm. In order to avoid replicas being created or deleted whenever a small metric fluctuation occurs, Kubernetes applies a form of hysteresis: it only changes the number of replicas when the current and desired metric values differ by more than 10%. In the example above, since the ratio between the current and desired metric values is (90/75), or 20% above target, exceeding the 10% tolerance, the scale-up action will proceed. This default tolerance of 10% is cluster-wide; in older Kubernetes releases, it could not be fine-tuned.</description></item><item><title>Kubernetes v1.33: User Namespaces enabled by default!</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-04-25-kubernetes-v1-33-user-namespaces-enabled-by-default/</link><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 10:30:00 -0800</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-04-25-kubernetes-v1-33-user-namespaces-enabled-by-default/</guid><description>In Kubernetes v1. 33 support for user namespaces is enabled by default.

In this blog post we answer some common questions about user namespaces. But, before we dive into that, let&amp;rsquo;s recap what user namespaces are and why they are important. Note: Linux user namespaces are a different concept from Kubernetes namespaces. The former is a Linux kernel feature; the latter is a Kubernetes feature. Linux provides different namespaces to isolate processes from each other. For example, a typical Kubernetes pod runs within a network namespace to isolate the network identity and a PID namespace to isolate the processes. One Linux namespace that was left behind is the user namespace. It isolates the UIDs and GIDs of the containers from the ones on the host. The identifiers in a container can be mapped to identifiers on the host in a way where host and container(s) never end up in overlapping UID/GIDs.</description></item><item><title>Kubernetes v1.33: Continuing the transition from Endpoints to EndpointSlices</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-04-24-kubernetes-v1-33-continuing-the-transition-from-endpoints-to-endpointslices/</link><pubDate>Thu, 24 Apr 2025 10:30:00 -0800</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-04-24-kubernetes-v1-33-continuing-the-transition-from-endpoints-to-endpointslices/</guid><description>Since the addition of EndpointSlices ( KEP-752 ) as alpha in v1. 15 and later GA in v1. 21, the Endpoints API in Kubernetes has been gathering dust. New Service features like dual-stack networking and traffic distribution are only supported via the EndpointSlice API, so all service proxies, Gateway API implementations, and similar controllers have had to be ported from using Endpoints to using EndpointSlices. At this point, the Endpoints API is really only there to avoid breaking end user workloads and scripts that still make use of it. As of Kubernetes 1. 33, the Endpoints API is now officially deprecated, and the API server will return warnings to users who read or write Endpoints resources rather than using EndpointSlices. Eventually, the plan (as documented in KEP-4974 ) is to change the Kubernetes Conformance criteria to no longer require that clusters run the Endpoints controller (which generates Endpoints objects based on Services and Pods), to avoid doing work that is unneeded in most modern-day clusters. Thus, while the Kubernetes deprecation policy means that the Endpoints type itself will probably never completely go away, users who still have workloads or scripts that use the Endpoints API should start migrating them to EndpointSlices. For end users, the biggest change between the Endpoints API and the EndpointSlice API is that while every Service with a selector has exactly 1 Endpoints object (with the same name as the Service), a Service may have any number of EndpointSlices associated with it: In this case, because the service is dual stack, it has 2 EndpointSlices: 1 for IPv4 addresses and 1 for IPv6 addresses. (The Endpoints API does not support dual stack, so the Endpoints object shows only the addresses in the cluster&amp;rsquo;s primary address family. ) Although any Service with multiple endpoints can have multiple EndpointSlices, there are three main cases where you will see this: An EndpointSlice can only represent endpoints of a single IP family, so dual-stack Services will have separate EndpointSlices for IPv4 and IPv6.</description></item><item><title>Kubernetes v1.33: Octarine</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-04-23-kubernetes-v1-33-octarine/</link><pubDate>Wed, 23 Apr 2025 10:30:00 -0800</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-04-23-kubernetes-v1-33-octarine/</guid><description>Editors: Agustina Barbetta, Aakanksha Bhende, Udi Hofesh, Ryota Sawada, Sneha Yadav Similar to previous releases, the release of Kubernetes v1. 33 introduces new stable, beta, and alpha features.

One of the most powerful yet nuanced design patterns in this ecosystem is the sidecar pattern—a technique that allows developers to extend application functionality without diving deep into source code. Think of a sidecar like a trusty companion motorcycle attachment. Historically, IT infrastructures have always used auxiliary services to handle critical tasks. Before containers, we relied on background processes and helper daemons to manage logging, monitoring, and networking. The microservices revolution transformed this approach, making sidecars a structured and intentional architectural choice. With the rise of microservices, the sidecar pattern became more clearly defined, allowing developers to offload specific responsibilities from the main service without altering its code. Service meshes like Istio and Linkerd have popularized sidecar proxies, demonstrating how these companion containers can elegantly handle observability, security, and traffic management in distributed systems. In Kubernetes, sidecar containers operate within the same Pod as the main application, enabling communication and resource sharing. Does this sound just like defining multiple containers along each other inside the Pod? It actually does, and this is how sidecar containers had to be implemented before Kubernetes v1. 29. 0, which introduced native support for sidecars.</description></item><item><title>New concepts pages for hybrid networking</title><link>https://kubermates.org/releases/2025-04-18-new-concepts-pages-for-hybrid-networking/</link><pubDate>Fri, 18 Apr 2025 19:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/releases/2025-04-18-new-concepts-pages-for-hybrid-networking/</guid><description>Help improve this page To contribute to this user guide, choose the Edit this page on GitHub link that is located in the right pane of every page.

An AWS managed policy is a standalone policy that is created and administered by AWS. AWS managed policies are designed to provide permissions for many common use cases so that you can start assigning permissions to users, groups, and roles. Keep in mind that AWS managed policies might not grant least-privilege permissions for your specific use cases because theyâre available for all AWS customers to use. We recommend that you reduce permissions further by defining customer managed policies that are specific to your use cases. You cannot change the permissions defined in AWS managed policies. If AWS updates the permissions defined in an AWS managed policy, the update affects all principal identities (users, groups, and roles) that the policy is attached to. AWS is most likely to update an AWS managed policy when a new AWS service is launched or new API operations become available for existing services. For more information, see AWS managed policies in the IAM User Guide. You can attach the AmazonEKS_CNI_Policy to your IAM entities. Before you create an Amazon EC2 node group, this policy must be attached to either the node IAM role , or to an IAM role thatâs used specifically by the Amazon VPC CNI plugin for Kubernetes. This is so that it can perform actions on your behalf.</description></item><item><title>Introducing kube-scheduler-simulator</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-04-07-introducing-kube-scheduler-simulator/</link><pubDate>Mon, 07 Apr 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-04-07-introducing-kube-scheduler-simulator/</guid><description>The Kubernetes Scheduler is a crucial control plane component that determines which node a Pod will run on. Thus, anyone utilizing Kubernetes relies on a scheduler. kube-scheduler-simulator is a simulator for the Kubernetes scheduler, that started as a Google Summer of Code 2021 project developed by me (Kensei Nakada) and later received a lot of contributions. This tool allows users to closely examine the scheduler’s behavior and decisions. It is useful for casual users who employ scheduling constraints (for example, inter-Pod affinity ) and experts who extend the scheduler with custom plugins. The scheduler often appears as a black box, composed of many plugins that each contribute to the scheduling decision-making process from their unique perspectives. Understanding its behavior can be challenging due to the multitude of factors it considers. Even if a Pod appears to be scheduled correctly in a simple test cluster, it might have been scheduled based on different calculations than expected. This discrepancy could lead to unexpected scheduling outcomes when deployed in a large production environment. Also, testing a scheduler is a complex challenge. There are countless patterns of operations executed within a real cluster, making it unfeasible to anticipate every scenario with a finite number of tests. More often than not, bugs are discovered only when the scheduler is deployed in an actual cluster.</description></item><item><title>EKS Hybrid Nodes for existing clusters</title><link>https://kubermates.org/releases/2025-03-31-eks-hybrid-nodes-for-existing-clusters/</link><pubDate>Mon, 31 Mar 2025 19:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/releases/2025-03-31-eks-hybrid-nodes-for-existing-clusters/</guid><description>Help improve this page To contribute to this user guide, choose the Edit this page on GitHub link that is located in the right pane of every page.

To enable an Amazon EKS cluster to use hybrid nodes, add the IP address CIDR ranges of your on-premises node and optionally pod network in the RemoteNetworkConfig configuration. EKS uses this list of CIDRs to enable connectivity between the cluster and your on-premises networks. For a full list of options when updating your cluster configuration, see the UpdateClusterConfig in the Amazon EKS API Reference. You can do any of the following actions to the EKS Hybrid Nodes networking configuration in a cluster: Add remote network configuration to enable EKS Hybrid Nodes in an existing cluster. Add, change, or remove the remote node networks or the remote pod networks in an existing cluster. Remove all remote node network CIDR ranges to disable EKS Hybrid Nodes in an existing cluster. Before enabling your Amazon EKS cluster for hybrid nodes, ensure your environment meets the requirements outlined at Prerequisite setup for hybrid nodes , and detailed at Prepare networking for hybrid nodes , Prepare operating system for hybrid nodes , and Prepare credentials for hybrid nodes.

When a new Kubernetes version is available in Amazon EKS, you can update your Amazon EKS cluster to the latest version. Once you upgrade a cluster, you canât downgrade to a previous version. Before you update to a new Kubernetes version, we recommend that you review the information in Understand the Kubernetes version lifecycle on EKS and the update steps in this topic. New Kubernetes versions sometimes introduce significant changes. Therefore, we recommend that you test the behavior of your applications against a new Kubernetes version before you update your production clusters. You can do this by building a continuous integration workflow to test your application behavior before moving to a new Kubernetes version. The update process consists of Amazon EKS launching new API server nodes with the updated Kubernetes version to replace the existing ones. Amazon EKS performs standard infrastructure and readiness health checks for network traffic on these new nodes to verify that theyâre working as expected. However, once youâve started the cluster upgrade, you canât pause or stop it. If any of these checks fail, Amazon EKS reverts the infrastructure deployment, and your cluster remains on the prior Kubernetes version. Running applications arenât affected, and your cluster is never left in a non-deterministic or unrecoverable state.</description></item><item><title>Bottlerocket FIPS AMIs</title><link>https://kubermates.org/releases/2025-03-27-bottlerocket-fips-amis/</link><pubDate>Thu, 27 Mar 2025 19:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/releases/2025-03-27-bottlerocket-fips-amis/</guid><description>Help improve this page To contribute to this user guide, choose the Edit this page on GitHub link that is located in the right pane of every page. The Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) Publication 140-3 is a United States and Canadian government standard that specifies the security requirements for cryptographic modules that protect sensitive information. Bottlerocket makes it easier to adhere to FIPS by offering AMIs with a FIPS kernel. These AMIs are preconfigured to use FIPS 140-3 validated cryptographic modules. This includes the Amazon Linux 2023 Kernel Crypto API Cryptographic Module and the AWS-LC Cryptographic Module. Using Bottlerocket FIPS AMIs makes your worker nodes &amp;ldquo;FIPS ready&amp;rdquo; but not automatically &amp;ldquo;FIPS-compliant&amp;rdquo;. For more information, see Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) 140-3. If your cluster uses isolated subnets, the Amazon ECR FIPS endpoint may not be accessible. This can cause the node bootstrap to fail. Make sure that your network configuration allows access to the necessary FIPS endpoints. For more information, see Access a resource through a resource VPC endpoint in the AWS PrivateLink Guide. If your cluster uses a subnet with PrivateLink , image pulls will fail because Amazon ECR FIPS endpoints are not available through PrivateLink.</description></item><item><title>Kubernetes v1.33 sneak peek</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-03-26-kubernetes-v1-33-sneak-peek/</link><pubDate>Wed, 26 Mar 2025 10:30:00 -0800</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-03-26-kubernetes-v1-33-sneak-peek/</guid><description>As the release of Kubernetes v1. 33 approaches, the Kubernetes project continues to evolve. Features may be deprecated, removed, or replaced to improve the overall health of the project. This blog post outlines some planned changes for the v1. 33 release, which the release team believes you should be aware of to ensure the continued smooth operation of your Kubernetes environment and to keep you up-to-date with the latest developments. The information below is based on the current status of the v1. 33 release and is subject to change before the final release date. The Kubernetes project has a well-documented deprecation policy for features. This policy states that stable APIs may only be deprecated when a newer, stable version of that same API is available and that APIs have a minimum lifetime for each stability level. A deprecated API has been marked for removal in a future Kubernetes release. It will continue to function until removal (at least one year from the deprecation), but usage will result in a warning being displayed. Removed APIs are no longer available in the current version, at which point you must migrate to using the replacement.</description></item><item><title>Kubeflow 1.10 Release Announcement</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-03-26-kubeflow-1-10-release-announcement/</link><pubDate>Wed, 26 Mar 2025 00:00:00 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-03-26-kubeflow-1-10-release-announcement/</guid><description>Mar 26, 2025 • Kubeflow 1. 10 Release Team, Dimitris Poulopoulos • 8 min read release Kubeflow 1. 10. 0 delivers essential updates that enhance the flexibility, efficiency, and scalability of machine learning workflows.

It offers numerous benefits, such as effectively increasing a node’s memory by swapping out unused data, shielding nodes from system-level memory spikes, preventing Pods from crashing when they hit their memory limits, and much more. As a result, the node special interest group within the Kubernetes project has invested significant effort into supporting swap on Linux nodes. The 1. 22 release introduced Alpha support for configuring swap memory usage for Kubernetes workloads running on Linux on a per-node basis. Later, in release 1. 28, support for swap on Linux nodes has graduated to Beta, along with many new improvements. In the following Kubernetes releases more improvements were made, paving the way to GA in the near future. Prior to version 1. 22, Kubernetes did not provide support for swap memory on Linux systems. This was due to the inherent difficulty in guaranteeing and accounting for pod memory utilization when swap memory was involved. As a result, swap support was deemed out of scope in the initial design of Kubernetes, and the default behavior of a kubelet was to fail to start if swap memory was detected on a node.</description></item><item><title>Ingress-nginx CVE-2025-1974: What You Need to Know</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-03-24-ingress-nginx-cve-2025-1974-what-you-need-to-know/</link><pubDate>Mon, 24 Mar 2025 12:00:00 -0800</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-03-24-ingress-nginx-cve-2025-1974-what-you-need-to-know/</guid><description>Today, the ingress-nginx maintainers have released patches for a batch of critical vulnerabilities that could make it easy for attackers to take over your Kubernetes cluster: ingress-nginx v1. 12. 1 and ingress-nginx v1. 11. 5. If you are among the over 40% of Kubernetes administrators using ingress-nginx , you should take action immediately to protect your users and data. Ingress is the traditional Kubernetes feature for exposing your workload Pods to the world so that they can be useful. In an implementation-agnostic way, Kubernetes users can define how their applications should be made available on the network. Then, an ingress controller uses that definition to set up local or cloud resources as required for the user’s particular situation and needs. Many different ingress controllers are available, to suit users of different cloud providers or brands of load balancers. Ingress-nginx is a software-only ingress controller provided by the Kubernetes project. Because of its versatility and ease of use, ingress-nginx is quite popular: it is deployed in over 40% of Kubernetes clusters! Ingress-nginx translates the requirements from Ingress objects into configuration for nginx, a powerful open source webserver daemon.</description></item><item><title>Introducing JobSet</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-03-23-introducing-jobset/</link><pubDate>Sun, 23 Mar 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-03-23-introducing-jobset/</guid><description>Authors : Daniel Vega-Myhre (Google), Abdullah Gharaibeh (Google), Kevin Hannon (Red Hat) In this article, we introduce JobSet , an open source API for representing distributed jobs. The goal of JobSet is to provide a unified API for distributed ML training and HPC workloads on Kubernetes. The Kubernetes community’s recent enhancements to the batch ecosystem on Kubernetes has attracted ML engineers who have found it to be a natural fit for the requirements of running distributed training workloads. Large ML models (particularly LLMs) which cannot fit into the memory of the GPU or TPU chips on a single host are often distributed across tens of thousands of accelerator chips, which in turn may span thousands of hosts. As such, the model training code is often containerized and executed simultaneously on all these hosts, performing distributed computations which often shard both the model parameters and/or the training dataset across the target accelerator chips, using communication collective primitives like all-gather and all-reduce to perform distributed computations and synchronize gradients between hosts. These workload characteristics make Kubernetes a great fit for this type of workload, as efficiently scheduling and managing the lifecycle of containerized applications across a cluster of compute resources is an area where it shines. It is also very extensible, allowing developers to define their own Kubernetes APIs, objects, and controllers which manage the behavior and life cycle of these objects, allowing engineers to develop custom distributed training orchestration solutions to fit their needs. However, as distributed ML training techniques continue to evolve, existing Kubernetes primitives do not adequately model them alone anymore. Furthermore, the landscape of Kubernetes distributed training orchestration APIs has become fragmented, and each of the existing solutions in this fragmented landscape has certain limitations that make it non-optimal for distributed ML training. For example, the KubeFlow training operator defines custom APIs for different frameworks (e. g. PyTorchJob, TFJob, MPIJob, etc.</description></item><item><title>🚀 Announcing the Kubeflow Spark Operator Benchmarking Results</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-03-15-announcing-the-kubeflow-spark-operator-benchmarking-results/</link><pubDate>Sat, 15 Mar 2025 00:00:00 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-03-15-announcing-the-kubeflow-spark-operator-benchmarking-results/</guid><description>Mar 15, 2025 • Vara Bonthu , Manabu McCloskey , Ratnopam Chakrabarti , Alan Halcyon • 5 min read operators benchmarking performance Kubernetes has become the go-to platform for running large-scale Apache Spark workloads. But as workloads scale, how do you ensure your Spark jobs run efficiently without hitting bottlenecks? Managing thousands of concurrent Spark jobs can introduce severe performance challenges —from CPU saturation in the Spark Operator to Kubernetes API slowdowns and job scheduling inefficiencies. To address these challenges, we are excited to introduce the Kubeflow Spark Operator Benchmarking Results and Toolkit —a comprehensive framework to analyze performance, pinpoint bottlenecks, and optimize your Spark on Kubernetes deployments. This benchmarking effort provides three key outcomes to help you take full control of your Spark on Kubernetes deployment: ✅ Benchmarking Results – A detailed evaluation of performance insights and tuning recommendations for large-scale Spark workloads. 🛠 Benchmarking Test Toolkit – A fully reproducible test suite to help users evaluate their own Spark Operator performance and validate improvements. 📊 Open-Sourced Grafana Dashboard – A battle-tested visualization tool designed specifically to track large-scale Spark Operator deployments, providing real-time monitoring of job processing efficiency, API latencies, and system health. Running thousands of Spark jobs on Kubernetes at scale uncovers several performance roadblocks that can cripple efficiency if left unresolved: 💡 So, how do you fix these issues and optimize your Spark Operator deployment? That’s where our benchmarking results and toolkit come in. Based on our benchmarking findings, we provide clear, actionable recommendations for improving Spark Operator performance at scale. If you’re running thousands of concurrent Spark jobs , here’s what you need to do: 💡 Why? A single Spark Operator instance struggles to keep up with high job submission rates. ✅ Solution : When a single Spark Operator instance struggles with high job submission rates, leading to CPU saturation and slower job launches, deploying multiple instances can help. Distribute the workload by assigning different namespaces to each instance. For example, one instance can manage ` 20 namespaces while another handles a separate set of 20 namespaces.</description></item><item><title>Blog: Spotlight on SIG Apps</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-03-12-blog-spotlight-on-sig-apps/</link><pubDate>Wed, 12 Mar 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-03-12-blog-spotlight-on-sig-apps/</guid><description>In our ongoing SIG Spotlight series, we dive into the heart of the Kubernetes project by talking to the leaders of its various Special Interest Groups (SIGs).

Currently in beta, it is expected to be GA as of 1. 33. The new mode fixes long-standing performance problems with the iptables mode and all users running on systems with reasonably-recent kernels are encouraged to try it out. (For compatibility reasons, even once nftables becomes GA, iptables will still be the default. ) The iptables API was designed for implementing simple firewalls, and has problems scaling up to support Service proxying in a large Kubernetes cluster with tens of thousands of Services. In general, the ruleset generated by kube-proxy in iptables mode has a number of iptables rules proportional to the sum of the number of Services and the total number of endpoints. In particular, at the top level of the ruleset, there is one rule to test each possible Service IP (and port) that a packet might be addressed to: This means that when a packet comes in, the time it takes the kernel to check it against all of the Service rules is O(n) in the number of Services. As the number of Services increases, both the average and the worst-case latency for the first packet of a new connection increases (with the difference between best-case, average, and worst-case being mostly determined by whether a given Service IP address appears earlier or later in the KUBE-SERVICES chain). By contrast, with nftables, the normal way to write a ruleset like this is to have a single rule, using a &amp;ldquo;verdict map&amp;rdquo; to do the dispatch: Since there&amp;rsquo;s only a single rule, with a roughly O(1) map lookup, packet processing time is more or less constant regardless of cluster size, and the best/average/worst cases are very similar: But note the huge difference in the vertical scale between the iptables and nftables graphs! In the clusters with 5000 and 10,000 Services, the p50 (average) latency for nftables is about the same as the p01 (approximately best-case) latency for iptables. In the 30,000 Service cluster, the p99 (approximately worst-case) latency for nftables manages to beat out the p01 latency for iptables by a few microseconds! Here&amp;rsquo;s both sets of data together, but you may have to squint to see the nftables results!: While the improvements to data plane latency in large clusters are great, there&amp;rsquo;s another problem with iptables kube-proxy that often keeps users from even being able to grow their clusters to that size: the time it takes kube-proxy to program new iptables rules when Services and their endpoints change.</description></item><item><title>🔐 Secure Secret Management with SOPS in Helm 🚀</title><link>https://kubermates.org/blog/secure-secret-management-with-sops-in-helm-1940/</link><pubDate>Thu, 27 Feb 2025 08:15:10 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/blog/secure-secret-management-with-sops-in-helm-1940/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;When managing applications deployed on Kubernetes, keeping secrets safe while still making them accessible to Helm charts is a challenge.

Feb 21, 2025 • Varsha Prasad Narsing (@varshaprasad96) • 7 min read katib As artificial intelligence and machine learning models become more sophisticated, optimising their performance remains a critical challenge. Kubeflow provides a robust component, Katib , designed for hyperparameter optimization and neural architecture search. As a part of the Kubeflow ecosystem, Katib enables scalable, automated tuning of underlying machine learning models, reducing the manual effort required for parameter selection while improving model performance across diverse ML workflows. With Retrieval-Augmented Generation ( RAG ) becoming an increasingly popular approach for improving search and retrieval quality, optimizing its parameters is essential to achieving high-quality results. RAG pipelines involve multiple hyperparameters that influence retrieval accuracy, hallucination reduction, and language generation quality. In this blog, we will explore how Katib can be leveraged to fine-tune a RAG pipeline, ensuring optimal performance by systematically adjusting key hyperparameters. Since compute resources are scarcer than a perfectly labeled dataset :), we’ll use a lightweight Kind cluster (Kubernetes in Docker) cluster to run this example locally. Rest assured, this setup can seamlessly scale to larger clusters by increasing the dataset size and the number of hyperparameters to tune. To get started, we’ll first install the Katib control plane in our cluster by following the steps outlined in the documentation. In this implementation, we use a retriever model , which encodes queries and documents into vector representations to find the most relevant matches, to fetch relevant documents based on a query and a generator model to produce coherent text responses. To run Katib, we will use the Katib SDK , which provides a programmatic interface for defining and running hyperparameter tuning experiments in Kubeflow.</description></item><item><title>Synthetic Data Generation with Kubeflow Pipelines</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-02-16-synthetic-data-generation-with-kubeflow-pipelines/</link><pubDate>Sun, 16 Feb 2025 00:00:00 -0600</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-02-16-synthetic-data-generation-with-kubeflow-pipelines/</guid><description>Feb 16, 2025 • Åke Edlund , Tarek Abouzeid • 11 min read kfp When creating insights, decisions, and actions from data, the best results come from real data. But accessing real data often requires lengthy security and legal processes. The data may also be incomplete, biased, or too small, and during early exploration, we may not even know if it’s worth pursuing. While real data is essential for proper evaluation, gaps or limited access frequently hinder progress until the formal process is complete. To address these challenges, synthetic data provides an alternative. It mimics real data’s statistical properties while preserving privacy and accessibility. Synthetic data generators (synthesizers) are models trained on real data to generate new datasets that follow the same statistical distributions and relationships but do not contain real records. This allows for accelerated development, improved data availability, and enhanced privacy. Depending on the technique used, synthetic data not only mirrors statistical base properties of real data but also preserves correlations between features. These synthesizers — such as those based on Gaussian Copulas, Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), and Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) — enable the creation of high-fidelity synthetic datasets. See more description of these techniques below.

While the component migration is now done, this leaves some additional complexity for users and installer projects (for example, kOps or Cluster API). We will go over those additional steps and failure points and make recommendations for cluster owners. This migration was complex and some logic had to be extracted from the core components, building four new subsystems. The cloud controller manager is part of the control plane. It is a critical component that replaces some functionality that existed previously in the kube-controller-manager and the kubelet. Components of Kubernetes One of the most critical functionalities of the cloud controller manager is the node controller, which is responsible for the initialization of the nodes. As you can see in the following diagram, when the kubelet starts, it registers the Node object with the apiserver, Tainting the node so it can be processed first by the cloud-controller-manager. The initial Node is missing the cloud-provider specific information, like the Node Addresses and the Labels with the cloud provider specific information like the Node, Region and Instance type information. Chicken and egg problem sequence diagram This new initialization process adds some latency to the node readiness. Previously, the kubelet was able to initialize the node at the same time it created the node.</description></item><item><title>Update strategies for managed node groups</title><link>https://kubermates.org/releases/2025-01-27-update-strategies-for-managed-node-groups/</link><pubDate>Mon, 27 Jan 2025 19:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/releases/2025-01-27-update-strategies-for-managed-node-groups/</guid><description>Help improve this page To contribute to this user guide, choose the Edit this page on GitHub link that is located in the right pane of every page. The Amazon EKS managed worker node upgrade strategy has four different phases described in the following sections. The setup phase has these steps: It creates a new Amazon EC2 launch template version for the Auto Scaling Group thatâs associated with your node group. The new launch template version uses the target AMI or a custom launch template version for the update. It updates the Auto Scaling Group to use the latest launch template version. It determines the maximum quantity of nodes to upgrade in parallel using the updateConfig property for the node group. The maximum unavailable has a quota of 100 nodes. The default value is one node. For more information, see the updateConfig property in the Amazon EKS API Reference. When upgrading the nodes in a managed node group, the upgraded nodes are launched in the same Availability Zone as those that are being upgraded. To guarantee this placement, we use Amazon EC2âs Availability Zone Rebalancing. For more information, see Availability Zone Rebalancing in the Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling User Guide.</description></item><item><title>Kubernetes version 1.32</title><link>https://kubermates.org/releases/2025-01-23-kubernetes-version-1-32/</link><pubDate>Thu, 23 Jan 2025 19:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/releases/2025-01-23-kubernetes-version-1-32/</guid><description>Help improve this page To contribute to this user guide, choose the Edit this page on GitHub link that is located in the right pane of every page. Kubernetes rapidly evolves with new features, design updates, and bug fixes. The community releases new Kubernetes minor versions (such as 1. 33 ) on average once every four months. Amazon EKS follows the upstream release and deprecation cycle for minor versions. As new Kubernetes versions become available in Amazon EKS, we recommend that you proactively update your clusters to use the latest available version. A minor version is under standard support in Amazon EKS for the first 14 months after itâs released. Once a version is past the end of standard support date, it enters extended support for the next 12 months. Extended support allows you to stay at a specific Kubernetes version for longer at an additional cost per cluster hour. If you havenât updated your cluster before the extended support period ends, your cluster is auto-upgraded to the oldest currently supported extended version. Extended support is enabled by default. To disable, see Disable EKS extended support.</description></item><item><title>Helm Chart Essentials &amp; Writing Effective Charts 🚀</title><link>https://kubermates.org/blog/helm-chart-essentials-writing-effective-charts-11ca/</link><pubDate>Thu, 23 Jan 2025 10:50:53 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/blog/helm-chart-essentials-writing-effective-charts-11ca/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Helm charts are a powerful way to define, install, and upgrade Kubernetes applications.

The recent release of Kubernetes v1. 32 moved that support to beta. The support for volume group snapshots relies on a set of extension APIs for group snapshots. These APIs allow users to take crash consistent snapshots for a set of volumes. Behind the scenes, Kubernetes uses a label selector to group multiple PersistentVolumeClaims for snapshotting. A key aim is to allow you restore that set of snapshots to new volumes and recover your workload based on a crash consistent recovery point. This new feature is only supported for CSI volume drivers. Some storage systems provide the ability to create a crash consistent snapshot of multiple volumes. A group snapshot represents copies made from multiple volumes, that are taken at the same point-in-time. A group snapshot can be used either to rehydrate new volumes (pre-populated with the snapshot data) or to restore existing volumes to a previous state (represented by the snapshots).</description></item><item><title>Enhancing Kubernetes API Server Efficiency with API Streaming</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2024-12-17-enhancing-kubernetes-api-server-efficiency-with-api-streaming/</link><pubDate>Tue, 17 Dec 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2024-12-17-enhancing-kubernetes-api-server-efficiency-with-api-streaming/</guid><description>Managing Kubernetes clusters efficiently is critical, especially as their size is growing. A significant challenge with large clusters is the memory overhead caused by list requests. In the existing implementation, the kube-apiserver processes list requests by assembling the entire response in-memory before transmitting any data to the client. But what if the response body is substantial, say hundreds of megabytes? Additionally, imagine a scenario where multiple list requests flood in simultaneously, perhaps after a brief network outage. While API Priority and Fairness has proven to reasonably protect kube-apiserver from CPU overload, its impact is visibly smaller for memory protection. This can be explained by the differing nature of resource consumption by a single API request - the CPU usage at any given time is capped by a constant, whereas memory, being uncompressible, can grow proportionally with the number of processed objects and is unbounded. This situation poses a genuine risk, potentially overwhelming and crashing any kube-apiserver within seconds due to out-of-memory (OOM) conditions. To better visualize the issue, let&amp;rsquo;s consider the below graph. The graph shows the memory usage of a kube-apiserver during a synthetic test. (see the synthetic test section for more details). The results clearly show that increasing the number of informers significantly boosts the server&amp;rsquo;s memory consumption. Notably, at approximately 16:40, the server crashed when serving only 16 informers.</description></item><item><title>Kubernetes v1.32 Adds A New CPU Manager Static Policy Option For Strict CPU Reservation</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2024-12-16-kubernetes-v1-32-adds-a-new-cpu-manager-static-policy-option-for-strict-cpu-rese/</link><pubDate>Mon, 16 Dec 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2024-12-16-kubernetes-v1-32-adds-a-new-cpu-manager-static-policy-option-for-strict-cpu-rese/</guid><description>In Kubernetes v1. 32, after years of community discussion, we are excited to introduce a strict-cpu-reservation option for the CPU Manager static policy. This feature is currently in alpha, with the associated policy hidden by default. You can only use the policy if you explicitly enable the alpha behavior in your cluster. The CPU Manager static policy is used to reduce latency or improve performance. The reservedSystemCPUs defines an explicit CPU set for OS system daemons and kubernetes system daemons. This option is designed for Telco/NFV type use cases where uncontrolled interrupts/timers may impact the workload performance. you can use this option to define the explicit cpuset for the system/kubernetes daemons as well as the interrupts/timers, so the rest CPUs on the system can be used exclusively for workloads, with less impact from uncontrolled interrupts/timers. More details of this parameter can be found on the Explicitly Reserved CPU List page. If you want to protect your system daemons and interrupt processing, the obvious way is to use the reservedSystemCPUs option. However, until the Kubernetes v1. 32 release, this isolation was only implemented for guaranteed pods that made requests for a whole number of CPUs.</description></item><item><title>Kubernetes v1.32: Memory Manager Goes GA</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2024-12-13-kubernetes-v1-32-memory-manager-goes-ga/</link><pubDate>Fri, 13 Dec 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2024-12-13-kubernetes-v1-32-memory-manager-goes-ga/</guid><description>With Kubernetes 1. 32, the memory manager has officially graduated to General Availability (GA), marking a significant milestone in the journey toward efficient and predictable memory allocation for containerized applications. Since Kubernetes v1. 22, where it graduated to beta, the memory manager has proved itself reliable, stable and a good complementary feature for the CPU Manager. As part of kubelet&amp;rsquo;s workload admission process, the memory manager provides topology hints to optimize memory allocation and alignment. This enables users to allocate exclusive memory for Pods in the Guaranteed QoS class. More details about the process can be found in the memory manager goes to beta blog. Most of the changes introduced since the Beta are bug fixes, internal refactoring and observability improvements, such as metrics and better logging. As part of the effort to increase the observability of memory manager, new metrics have been added to provide some statistics on memory allocation patterns. memory_manager_pinning_requests_total - tracks the number of times the pod spec required the memory manager to pin memory pages. memory_manager_pinning_errors_total - tracks the number of times the pod spec required the memory manager to pin memory pages, but the allocation failed. The kubelet does not guarantee pod ordering when admitting pods after a restart or reboot.</description></item><item><title>Kubernetes v1.32: QueueingHint Brings a New Possibility to Optimize Pod Scheduling</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2024-12-12-kubernetes-v1-32-queueinghint-brings-a-new-possibility-to-optimize-pod-schedulin/</link><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2024-12-12-kubernetes-v1-32-queueinghint-brings-a-new-possibility-to-optimize-pod-schedulin/</guid><description>The Kubernetes scheduler is the core component that selects the nodes on which new Pods run. The scheduler processes these new Pods one by one. Therefore, the larger your clusters, the more important the throughput of the scheduler becomes. Over the years, Kubernetes SIG Scheduling has improved the throughput of the scheduler in multiple enhancements. This blog post describes a major improvement to the scheduler in Kubernetes v1. 32: a scheduling context element named QueueingHint. This page provides background knowledge of the scheduler and explains how QueueingHint improves scheduling throughput. The scheduler stores all unscheduled Pods in an internal component called the scheduling queue.

In line with previous releases, the release of Kubernetes v1. 32 introduces new stable, beta, and alpha features. The consistent delivery of high-quality releases underscores the strength of our development cycle and the vibrant support from our community. This release consists of 44 enhancements in total. Of those enhancements, 13 have graduated to Stable, 12 are entering Beta, and 19 have entered in Alpha. The Kubernetes v1. 32 Release Theme is &amp;ldquo;Penelope&amp;rdquo;. If Kubernetes is Ancient Greek for &amp;ldquo;pilot&amp;rdquo;, in this release we start from that origin and reflect on the last 10 years of Kubernetes and our accomplishments: each release cycle is a journey, and just like Penelope, in &amp;ldquo;The Odyssey&amp;rdquo;, weaved for 10 years &amp;ndash; each night removing parts of what she had done during the day &amp;ndash; so does each release add new features and removes others, albeit here with a much clearer purpose of constantly improving Kubernetes. With v1. 32 being the last release in the year Kubernetes marks its first decade anniversary, we wanted to honour all of those that have been part of the global Kubernetes crew that roams the cloud-native seas through perils and challanges: may we continue to weave the future of Kubernetes together. In this release, like the previous one, the Kubernetes project continues proposing a number of enhancements to the Dynamic Resource Allocation (DRA), a key component of the Kubernetes resource management system.</description></item><item><title>Amazon EKS Auto Mode</title><link>https://kubermates.org/releases/2024-12-01-amazon-eks-auto-mode/</link><pubDate>Sun, 01 Dec 2024 19:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/releases/2024-12-01-amazon-eks-auto-mode/</guid><description>Help improve this page To contribute to this user guide, choose the Edit this page on GitHub link that is located in the right pane of every page.

Now that the v1 versions of GRPCRoute and ReferenceGrant have graduated to Standard, the old v1alpha2 versions have been removed from both the Standard and Experimental channels, in order to ease the maintenance burden that perpetually supporting the old versions would place on the Gateway API community. Before upgrading to Gateway API v1. 2, you&amp;rsquo;ll want to confirm that any implementations of Gateway API have been upgraded to support the v1 API version of these resources instead of the v1alpha2 API version. Note that even if you&amp;rsquo;ve been using v1 in your YAML manifests, a controller may still be using v1alpha2 which would cause it to fail during this upgrade. Additionally, Kubernetes itself goes to some effort to stop you from removing a CRD version that it thinks you&amp;rsquo;re using: check out the release notes for more information about what you need to do to safely upgrade. A much smaller breaking change:. status. supportedFeatures in a Gateway is now a list of objects instead of a list of strings.</description></item><item><title>How we built a dynamic Kubernetes API Server for the API Aggregation Layer in Cozystack</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2024-11-21-how-we-built-a-dynamic-kubernetes-api-server-for-the-api-aggregation-layer-in-co/</link><pubDate>Thu, 21 Nov 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2024-11-21-how-we-built-a-dynamic-kubernetes-api-server-for-the-api-aggregation-layer-in-co/</guid><description>Hi there! I&amp;rsquo;m Andrei Kvapil, but you might know me as @kvaps in communities dedicated to Kubernetes and cloud-native tools. In this article, I want to share how we implemented our own extension api-server in the open-source PaaS platform, Cozystack. Kubernetes truly amazes me with its powerful extensibility features. You&amp;rsquo;re probably already familiar with the controller concept and frameworks like kubebuilder and operator-sdk that help you implement it. In a nutshell, they allow you to extend your Kubernetes cluster by defining custom resources (CRDs) and writing additional controllers that handle your business logic for reconciling and managing these kinds of resources. This approach is well-documented, with a wealth of information available online on how to develop your own operators. However, this is not the only way to extend the Kubernetes API. For more complex scenarios such as implementing imperative logic, managing subresources, and dynamically generating responses—the Kubernetes API aggregation layer provides an effective alternative. Through the aggregation layer, you can develop a custom extension API server and seamlessly integrate it within the broader Kubernetes API framework. In this article, I will explore the API aggregation layer, the types of challenges it is well-suited to address, cases where it may be less appropriate, and how we utilized this model to implement our own extension API server in Cozystack. First, let&amp;rsquo;s get definitions straight to avoid any confusion down the road. The API aggregation layer is a feature in Kubernetes, while an extension api-server is a specific implementation of an API server for the aggregation layer.</description></item><item><title>Bottlerocket AMIs that use FIPS 140-3</title><link>https://kubermates.org/releases/2024-11-20-bottlerocket-amis-that-use-fips-140-3/</link><pubDate>Wed, 20 Nov 2024 19:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/releases/2024-11-20-bottlerocket-amis-that-use-fips-140-3/</guid><description>Help improve this page To contribute to this user guide, choose the Edit this page on GitHub link that is located in the right pane of every page.

Information listed below is based on the current status of the v1. 32 release and may change before the actual release date. The Kubernetes project has a well-documented deprecation policy for features. This policy states that stable APIs may only be deprecated when a newer, stable version of that API is available and that APIs have a minimum lifetime for each stability level. A deprecated API has been marked for removal in a future Kubernetes release will continue to function until removal (at least one year from the deprecation). Its usage will result in a warning being displayed. Removed APIs are no longer available in the current version, so you must migrate to use the replacement instead.</description></item><item><title>Creating alerts from panels in Kubernetes Monitoring: an overlooked, powerhouse feature</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2024-11-04-creating-alerts-from-panels-in-kubernetes-monitoring-an-overlooked-powerhouse-fe/</link><pubDate>Mon, 04 Nov 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2024-11-04-creating-alerts-from-panels-in-kubernetes-monitoring-an-overlooked-powerhouse-fe/</guid><description>Alejandro Fraenkel Â· 5 Aug 2025 Â· 9 min read We built a brand new alert rules list page.

Our team is composed of members who actively contribute to Kubernetes, including individuals who hold roles such as member, reviewer, approver, and chair. Our goal is to increase the number of Kubernetes contributors and foster the growth of the community. While Kubernetes community is friendly and collaborative, newcomers may find the first step of contributing to be a bit challenging. Our training program aims to lower that barrier and create an environment where even beginners can participate smoothly. Our training started in 2019 and is held 1 to 2 times a year. Initially, Kubernetes Upstream Training was conducted as a co-located event of KubeCon (Kubernetes Contributor Summit), but we launched Kubernetes Upstream Training in Japan with the aim of increasing Japanese contributors by hosting a similar event in Japan. Before the pandemic, the training was held in person, but since 2020, it has been conducted online. The training offers the following content for those who have not yet contributed to Kubernetes: At the beginning of the program, we explain why contributing to Kubernetes is important and who can contribute. We emphasize that contributing to Kubernetes allows you to make a global impact and that Kubernetes community is looking forward to your contributions! We also explain Kubernetes community, SIGs, and Working Groups. Next, we explain the roles and responsibilities of Member, Reviewer, Approver, Tech Lead, and Chair. Additionally, we introduce the communication tools we primarily use, such as Slack, GitHub, and mailing lists.</description></item><item><title>Monitoring Kubernetes: Why traditional techniques aren't enough</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2024-10-18-monitoring-kubernetes-why-traditional-techniques-aren-t-enough/</link><pubDate>Fri, 18 Oct 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2024-10-18-monitoring-kubernetes-why-traditional-techniques-aren-t-enough/</guid><description>Serena Kei Â· 15 Jul 2025 Â· 4 min read The latest backend update to our Kubernetes Monitoring app in Grafana Cloud features significant improvements to alert rules and recording rules that.

In this interview, Sandeep Kanabar , a deaf member of the DHHWG and part of the Kubernetes SIG ContribEx Communications team , sits down with Catherine to explore the impact of the DHHWG on cloud native projects like Kubernetes. Sandeep’s journey is a testament to the power of inclusion. Through his involvement in the DHHWG, he connected with members of the Kubernetes community who encouraged him to join SIG ContribEx - the group responsible for sustaining the Kubernetes contributor experience. In an ecosystem where open-source projects are actively seeking contributors and maintainers, this story highlights how important it is to create pathways for underrepresented groups, including those with disabilities, to contribute their unique perspectives and skills. In this interview, we delve into Catherine’s journey, the challenges and triumphs of establishing the DHHWG, and the vision for a more inclusive future in cloud native. We invite Kubernetes contributors, maintainers, and community members to reflect on the significance of empathy, advocacy, and community in fostering a truly inclusive environment for all, and to think about how they can support efforts to increase diversity and accessibility within their own projects. Sandeep Kanabar (SK): Hello Catherine, could you please introduce yourself, share your professional background, and explain your connection to the Kubernetes ecosystem? Catherine Paganini (CP) : I’m the Head of Marketing at Buoyant , the creator of Linkerd , the CNCF-graduated service mesh, and 5th CNCF project. Four years ago, I started contributing to open source.

Firstly, I got to know about GSoC and Kubeflow with the recommendation from the former active maintainer Ce Gao(gaocegege)’s personal blog. And I was deeply impressed by the idea of cloud native AI toolkits, I decided to dive into this area and learn some skills to enhance my career and future. In the blog, I’ll provide my personal insight into Katib, for those who are interested in cloud native, AI, and hyperparameters tuning. The project aims to provide a Python SDK API interface for users to push metrics to Katib DB directly. The current implementation of Metrics Collector is pull-based, raising design problems such as determining the frequency at which we scrape the metrics, performance issues like the overhead caused by too many sidecar containers, and restrictions on developing environments that must support sidecar containers and admission webhooks. And also, for data scientists, they need to pay attention to the format of metrics printed in the training scripts, which is error prone and may be hard to recognize. We decided to implement a new API for Katib Python SDK to offer users a push-based way to store metrics directly into the Kaitb DB and resolve those issues raised by pull-based metrics collection. In the new design, users just need to set metrics_collector_config={&amp;ldquo;kind&amp;rdquo;: &amp;ldquo;Push&amp;rdquo;} in the tune() function and call the report_metrics() API in their objective function to push metrics to Katib DB directly. There are no sidecar containers and restricted metric log formats any more. After that, Trial Controller will continuously collect metrics from Katib DB and update the status of Trial, which is the same as pull-based metrics collection. If you are interested in it, please refer to this doc and example for more details.</description></item><item><title>Capsule: How to Use It and First Steps to Set It Up on an AKS Cluster 🚀</title><link>https://kubermates.org/blog/capsule-how-to-use-it-and-first-steps-to-set-it-up-on-an-aks-cluster-5hl5/</link><pubDate>Tue, 24 Sep 2024 19:24:03 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/blog/capsule-how-to-use-it-and-first-steps-to-set-it-up-on-an-aks-cluster-5hl5/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Capsule is an awesome, open-source solution that helps you manage multiple tenants in Kubernetes clusters, making it super easy to handle multi-tenancy.

My project focused on developing a high-level API for optimizing hyperparameters in Large Language Models (LLMs) within Katib, Kubeflow’s automated hyperparameter tuning system. I’d like to share insights from this experience with others interested in Kubeflow, GSoC, or optimizing LLMs. The rapid advancements and rising popularity of LLMs, such as GPT and BERT, have created a growing demand for efficient LLMOps in Kubernetes. To address this, we have developed a train API within the Training Python SDK, simplifying the process of fine-tuning LLMs using distributed PyTorchJob workers. However, hyperparameter optimization remains a crucial yet labor-intensive task for enhancing model performance. Hyperparameter optimization is essential but time-consuming, especially for LLMs with billions of parameters. This API simplifies the process by handling Kubernetes infrastructure, allowing data scientists to focus on model performance rather than system configuration. With this API, users can import pretrained models and datasets from Hugging Face and Amazon S3, define parameters including the hyperparameter search space, optimization objective, and resource configuration. The API then automates the creation of Experiment, which contains multiple Trials with different hyperparameter settings using PyTorch distributed training. It then collects and analyzes the metrics from each Trial to identify the optimal hyperparameter configuration. For detailed instruction on using the API, please refer to this guide My work on the project can be broadly divided into four stages: In addition, I addressed several critical bugs in previous Katib and Training Operator releases and contributed new features, such as writing end-to-end tests for the train API.</description></item><item><title>Admission Controllers in Kubernetes: OPA GateKeeper, Kyverno, and Azure Policy Add-on for AKS—Which One Wins? 🏆</title><link>https://kubermates.org/blog/admission-controllers-in-kubernetes-opa-gatekeeper-kyverno-and-azure-policy-add-on-for-aks-which-one-wins-237d/</link><pubDate>Tue, 17 Sep 2024 07:25:52 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/blog/admission-controllers-in-kubernetes-opa-gatekeeper-kyverno-and-azure-policy-add-on-for-aks-which-one-wins-237d/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;When managing a Kubernetes cluster, controlling what gets deployed and ensuring resources comply with security, governance, and operational policies is essential.

&lt;p&gt;Think of &lt;strong&gt;Pod Topology Spread Constraints&lt;/strong&gt; as a way to tell Kubernetes, &amp;ldquo;Hey, I want my Pods spread out evenly across different parts of my cluster.&amp;rdquo; This helps prevent all your Pods from ending up in the same spot, which could be a problem if that spot has an issue.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>How to Test the Latest Kubernetes Changes in Version 1.31 "Elli"</title><link>https://kubermates.org/blog/how-to-test-the-latest-kubernetes-changes-in-version-131-elli-39ec/</link><pubDate>Wed, 14 Aug 2024 21:38:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/blog/how-to-test-the-latest-kubernetes-changes-in-version-131-elli-39ec/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Testing Kubernetes 1.31 &amp;ldquo;Elli&amp;rdquo; involves setting up a dedicated environment, verifying new features, validating API changes, running automated tests, and closely monitoring your cluster. Here’s a detailed guide with examples for each step.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="1-set-up-a-testing-environment"&gt;1. Set Up a Testing Environment&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Create a Kubernetes Cluster&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Example&lt;/strong&gt;: Use Minikube to create a local cluster. Run:
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"&gt;&lt;code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;&lt;span class="cl"&gt;minikube start --kubernetes-version&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;v1.31.0
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;This command sets up a Kubernetes 1.31 cluster locally, allowing you to test the new features and changes in a controlled environment.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cloud-Based Testing&lt;/strong&gt;: For cloud environments, use a tool like &lt;code&gt;eksctl&lt;/code&gt; for Amazon EKS:
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"&gt;&lt;code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;&lt;span class="cl"&gt;eksctl create cluster --version 1.31 --name test-cluster
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;This command creates an Amazon EKS cluster with Kubernetes 1.31, suitable for more extensive testing scenarios.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

Frederico (FSM): Hello, and thank your for your time. To start with, could you tell us about yourselves and how you got involved in Kubernetes? David : I started working on OpenShift (the Red Hat distribution of Kubernetes) in the fall of 2014 and got involved pretty quickly in API Machinery. My first PRs were fixing kube-apiserver error messages and from there I branched out to kubectl ( kubeconfigs are my fault!), auth ( RBAC and *Review APIs are ports from OpenShift), apps ( workqueues and sharedinformers for example). Don’t tell the others, but API Machinery is still my favorite :) Federico : I was not as early in Kubernetes as David, but now it’s been more than six years. At my previous company we were starting to use Kubernetes for our own products, and when I came across the opportunity to work directly with Kubernetes I left everything and boarded the ship (no pun intended). I joined Google and Kubernetes in early 2018, and have been involved since. FSM: It only takes a quick look at the SIG API Machinery charter to see that it has quite a significant scope, nothing less than the Kubernetes control plane. Could you describe this scope in your own words? David : We own the kube-apiserver and how to efficiently use it. On the backend, that includes its contract with backend storage and how it allows API schema evolution over time. On the frontend, that includes schema best practices, serialization, client patterns, and controller patterns on top of all of it. Federico : Kubernetes has a lot of different components, but the control plane has a really critical mission: it’s your communication layer with the cluster and also owns all the extensibility mechanisms that make Kubernetes so powerful.</description></item><item><title>Monitor these Kubernetes signals to help rightsize your fleet</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2024-07-29-monitor-these-kubernetes-signals-to-help-rightsize-your-fleet/</link><pubDate>Mon, 29 Jul 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2024-07-29-monitor-these-kubernetes-signals-to-help-rightsize-your-fleet/</guid><description>Serena Kei Â· 15 Jul 2025 Â· 4 min read The latest backend update to our Kubernetes Monitoring app in Grafana Cloud features significant improvements to alert rules and recording rules that.

A model registry provides a central catalog for ML model developers to index and manage models, versions, and ML artifacts metadata. It fills a gap between model experimentation and production activities. It provides a central interface for all stakeholders in the ML lifecycle to collaborate on ML models. Model registry has been asked by the community for a long time and we are delighted to introduce it to the Kubeflow ecosystem. This initial release includes REST APIs and a Python SDK to track model artifacts and model metadata with a standardized format that can be reused across Kubeflow components, such as to deploy Inference Servers. You can get started by following the Model Registry tutorial on the Kubeflow website , or see a short demo video of the Model Registry in action. We are just getting started. This is an Alpha version and we look forward to feedback.</description></item><item><title>Blog: Spotlight on SIG Node</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2024-06-20-blog-spotlight-on-sig-node/</link><pubDate>Thu, 20 Jun 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2024-06-20-blog-spotlight-on-sig-node/</guid><description>In the world of container orchestration, Kubernetes reigns supreme, powering some of the most complex and dynamic applications across the globe.

This is where conformance testing becomes crucial, verifying that a Kubernetes cluster meets the required standards set by the community. Today, we’re thrilled to introduce Hydrophone , a lightweight runner designed to streamline Kubernetes tests using the official conformance images released by the Kubernetes release team. Hydrophone’s design philosophy centers around ease of use. By starting the conformance image as a pod within the conformance namespace, Hydrophone waits for the tests to conclude, then prints and exports the results. This approach offers a hassle-free method for running either individual tests or the entire Conformance Test Suite. In the Kubernetes world, where providers like EKS, Rancher, and k3s offer diverse environments, ensuring consistent experiences is vital. This consistency is anchored in conformance testing, which validates whether these environments adhere to Kubernetes community standards. Historically, this validation has either been cumbersome or requires third-party tools. Hydrophone offers a simple, single binary tool that streamlines running these essential conformance tests. It’s designed to be user-friendly, allowing for straightforward validation of Kubernetes clusters against community benchmarks, ensuring providers can offer a certified, consistent service. Hydrophone doesn’t aim to replace the myriad of Kubernetes testing frameworks out there but rather to complement them.</description></item><item><title>How to use the Grafana Operator: Managing a Grafana Cloud stack in Kubernetes</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2024-04-24-how-to-use-the-grafana-operator-managing-a-grafana-cloud-stack-in-kubernetes/</link><pubDate>Wed, 24 Apr 2024 10:22:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2024-04-24-how-to-use-the-grafana-operator-managing-a-grafana-cloud-stack-in-kubernetes/</guid><description>Elizabeth Burkly Â· 26 Aug 2025 Â· 9 min read With our Voice of Customer program, we can tighten the loop between what our users ask for and what we prioritize in R&amp;amp;D.

The Kubeflow Spark Operator simplifies the deployment and management of Apache Spark applications on Kubernetes. This announcement isn’t just about a new piece of technology, it’s about building a stronger, open-governed, and more collaborative community around Spark on Kubernetes. The journey of the Kubeflow Spark Operator began with Google Cloud Platform’s Spark on Kubernetes Operator (https://cloud. google. com/blog/products/data-analytics/data-analytics-meet-containers-kubernetes-operator-for-apache-spark-now-in-beta). With over 2. 3k stars and 1. 3k forks on GitHub, this project laid the foundation for a robust Spark on Kubernetes experience, enabling users to deploy Spark workloads seamlessly across Kubernetes clusters. Growth and innovation require not just code but also community. Acknowledging the resource and time limitations faced by Google Cloud’s original maintainers, Kubeflow has taken up the mantle. This transition is not merely administrative but a strategic move towards fostering a vibrant, diverse, and more actively engaged community.</description></item><item><title>Blog: Spotlight on SIG Architecture: Code Organization</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2024-04-11-blog-spotlight-on-sig-architecture-code-organization/</link><pubDate>Thu, 11 Apr 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2024-04-11-blog-spotlight-on-sig-architecture-code-organization/</guid><description>This is the third interview of a SIG Architecture Spotlight series that will cover the different subprojects. We will cover SIG Architecture: Code Organization. In this SIG Architecture spotlight I talked with Madhav Jivrajani (VMware), a member of the Code Organization subproject. Frederico (FSM) : Hello Madhav, thank you for your availability. Could you start by telling us a bit about yourself, your role and how you got involved in Kubernetes? Madhav Jivrajani (MJ) : Hello! My name is Madhav Jivrajani, I serve as a technical lead for SIG Contributor Experience and a GitHub Admin for the Kubernetes project. Apart from that I also contribute to SIG API Machinery and SIG Etcd, but more recently, I’ve been helping out with the work that is needed to help Kubernetes stay on supported versions of Go , and it is through this that I am involved with the Code Organization subproject of SIG Architecture. FSM : A project the size of Kubernetes must have unique challenges in terms of code organization – is this a fair assumption? If so, what would you pick as some of the main challenges that are specific to Kubernetes? MJ : That’s a fair assumption! The first interesting challenge comes from the sheer size of the Kubernetes codebase. We have ≅2. 2 million lines of Go code (which is steadily decreasing thanks to dims and other folks in this sub-project!), and a little over 240 dependencies that we rely on either directly or indirectly, which is why having a sub-project dedicated to helping out with dependency management is crucial: we need to know what dependencies we’re pulling in, what versions these dependencies are at, and tooling to help make sure we are managing these dependencies across different parts of the codebase in a consistent manner. Another interesting challenge with Kubernetes is that we publish a lot of Go modules as part of the Kubernetes release cycles, one example of this is client-go. However, we as a project would also like the benefits of having everything in one repository to get the advantages of using a monorepo, like atomic commits… so, because of this, code organization works with other SIGs (like SIG Release) to automate the process of publishing code from the monorepo to downstream individual repositories which are much easier to consume, and this way you won’t have to import the entire Kubernetes codebase! FSM : For someone just starting contributing to Kubernetes code-wise, what are the main things they should consider in terms of code organization? How would you sum up the key concepts? MJ : I think one of the key things to keep in mind at least as you’re starting off is the concept of staging directories. In the kubernetes/kubernetes repository, you will come across a directory called staging/.</description></item><item><title>Blog: Using Go workspaces in Kubernetes</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2024-03-19-blog-using-go-workspaces-in-kubernetes/</link><pubDate>Tue, 19 Mar 2024 08:30:00 -0800</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2024-03-19-blog-using-go-workspaces-in-kubernetes/</guid><description>The Go programming language has played a huge role in the success of Kubernetes. As Kubernetes has grown, matured, and pushed the bounds of what “regular” projects do, the Go project team has also grown and evolved the language and tools. In recent releases, Go introduced a feature called “workspaces” which was aimed at making projects like Kubernetes easier to manage. We’ve just completed a major effort to adopt workspaces in Kubernetes, and the results are great. Our codebase is simpler and less error-prone, and we’re no longer off on our own technology island. Kubernetes is one of the most visible open source projects written in Go. The earliest versions of Kubernetes, dating back to 2014, were built with Go 1. 3. Today, 10 years later, Go is up to version 1. 22 — and let’s just say that a whole lot has changed. In 2014, Go development was entirely based on GOPATH. As a Go project, Kubernetes lived by the rules of GOPATH.</description></item><item><title>Grafana Labs at KubeCon: eBPF, sustainability, Prometheus, and more</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2024-03-15-grafana-labs-at-kubecon-ebpf-sustainability-prometheus-and-more/</link><pubDate>Fri, 15 Mar 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2024-03-15-grafana-labs-at-kubecon-ebpf-sustainability-prometheus-and-more/</guid><description>Colin Steele Â· 22 Aug 2025 Â· 5 min read Learn how Beyla, eBPF, and OpenTelemetry combine to make homelab observability easy with this recap of a recent GrafanaCON 2025 session.

How does this whole process of integration of Kubernetes to various cloud providers happen? To answer that, let’s put the spotlight on SIG Cloud Provider. SIG Cloud Provider works to create seamless integrations between Kubernetes and various cloud providers. Their mission? Keeping the Kubernetes ecosystem fair and open for all. By setting clear standards and requirements, they ensure every cloud provider plays nicely with Kubernetes. It is their responsibility to configure cluster components to enable cloud provider integrations. In this blog of the SIG Spotlight series, Arujjwal Negi interviews Michael McCune (Red Hat), also known as elmiko , co-chair of SIG Cloud Provider, to give us an insight into the workings of this group. Arujjwal : Let’s start by getting to know you. Can you give us a small intro about yourself and how you got into Kubernetes? Michael : Hi, I’m Michael McCune, most people around the community call me by my handle, elmiko. I’ve been a software developer for a long time now (Windows 3. 1 was popular when I started!), and I’ve been involved with open-source software for most of my career. I first got involved with Kubernetes as a developer of machine learning and data science applications; the team I was on at the time was creating tutorials and examples to demonstrate the use of technologies like Apache Spark on Kubernetes. That said, I’ve been interested in distributed systems for many years and when an opportunity arose to join a team working directly on Kubernetes, I jumped at it! Arujjwal : Can you give us an insight into what SIG Cloud Provider does and how it functions? Michael : SIG Cloud Provider was formed to help ensure that Kubernetes provides a neutral integration point for all infrastructure providers.</description></item><item><title>Blog: A look into the Kubernetes Book Club</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2024-02-22-blog-a-look-into-the-kubernetes-book-club/</link><pubDate>Thu, 22 Feb 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2024-02-22-blog-a-look-into-the-kubernetes-book-club/</guid><description>Learning Kubernetes and the entire ecosystem of technologies around it is not without its challenges. In this interview, we will talk with Carlos Santana (AWS) to learn a bit more about how he created the Kubernetes Book Club , how it works, and how anyone can join in to take advantage of a community-based learning experience. Frederico Muñoz (FSM) : Hello Carlos, thank you so much for your availability. To start with, could you tell us a bit about yourself? Carlos Santana (CS) : Of course. My experience in deploying Kubernetes in production six years ago opened the door for me to join Knative and then contribute to Kubernetes through the Release Team. Working on upstream Kubernetes has been one of the best experiences I’ve had in open-source. Over the past two years, in my role as a Senior Specialist Solutions Architect at AWS, I have been assisting large enterprises build their internal developer platforms (IDP) on top of Kubernetes. Going forward, my open source contributions are directed towards CNOE and CNCF projects like Argo , Crossplane , and Backstage. FSM : So your path led you to Kubernetes, and at that point what was the motivating factor for starting the Book Club? CS : The idea for the Kubernetes Book Club sprang from a casual suggestion during a TGIK livestream. For me, it was more than just about reading a book; it was about creating a learning community. This platform has not only been a source of knowledge but also a support system, especially during the challenging times of the pandemic. It’s gratifying to see how this initiative has helped members cope and grow.</description></item><item><title>Kubernetes alerting: Simplify anomaly detection in Kubernetes clusters with Grafana Cloud</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2024-02-15-kubernetes-alerting-simplify-anomaly-detection-in-kubernetes-clusters-with-grafa/</link><pubDate>Thu, 15 Feb 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2024-02-15-kubernetes-alerting-simplify-anomaly-detection-in-kubernetes-clusters-with-grafa/</guid><description>Alejandro Fraenkel Â· 5 Aug 2025 Â· 9 min read We built a brand new alert rules list page.

Have you ever considered how such a big project like Kubernetes manages its timeline so efficiently to release its new version, or how the internal workings of the Release Team look like? If you’re curious about these questions or want to know more and get involved with the work SIG Release does, read on! SIG Release plays a crucial role in the development and evolution of Kubernetes. Its primary responsibility is to manage the release process of new versions of Kubernetes. It operates on a regular release cycle, typically every three to four months. During this cycle, the Kubernetes Release Team works closely with other SIGs and contributors to ensure a smooth and well-coordinated release. This includes planning the release schedule, setting deadlines for code freeze and testing phases, as well as creating release artefacts like binaries, documentation, and release notes. Before you read further, it is important to note that there are two subprojects under SIG Release - Release Engineering and Release Team. In this blog post, Nitish Kumar interviews Verónica López (PlanetScale), Technical Lead of SIG Release, with the spotlight on the Release Team subproject, how the release process looks like, and ways to get involved. What is the typical release process for a new version of Kubernetes, from initial planning to the final release? Are there any specific methodologies and tools that you use to ensure a smooth release? The release process for a new Kubernetes version is a well-structured and community-driven effort. There are no specific methodologies or tools as such that we follow, except a calendar with a series of steps to keep things organised. The complete release process looks like this: Release Team Onboarding: We start with the formation of a Release Team, which includes volunteers from the Kubernetes community who will be responsible for managing different components of the new release. This is typically done before the previous release is about to wrap up.</description></item><item><title>Blog: Blixt - A load-balancer written in Rust, using eBPF, born from Gateway API</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2024-01-08-blog-blixt-a-load-balancer-written-in-rust-using-ebpf-born-from-gateway-api/</link><pubDate>Mon, 08 Jan 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2024-01-08-blog-blixt-a-load-balancer-written-in-rust-using-ebpf-born-from-gateway-api/</guid><description>In SIG Network we now have a layer 4 (“L4”) load balancer named Blixt. This project started as a fun experiment using emerging technologies and is intended to become a utility for CI and testing to help facilitate the continued development of Gateway API. Are you interested in developing networking tools in Rust and eBPF ? Or perhaps you’re specifically interested in Gateway API? We’ll tell you a bit about the project and how it might benefit you. Blixt originated at Kong as an experiment to test load-balancing ingress traffic for Kubernetes clusters using eBPF for the dataplane. Around the time of Kubecon Detroit (2022) we (the Gateway API maintainers) realized it had significant potential to help us move our TCPRoute and UDPRoute support forward, which had been sort of “stuck in alpha” at the time due to a lack of conformance tests being developed for them. At the same time, various others in the SIG Network community developed an interest in the project due to the rapid growth of eBPFs use on Kubernetes. Given the potential for benefit to the Kubernetes ecosystem and the growing interest, Kong decided it would be helpful to donate the project to Kubernetes SIGs to benefit upstream Kubernetes. Over several months we rewrote the project in Rust (from C), due to a strong contingency of Rust knowledge (and interest) between us developing the project and an active interest in the burgeoning Aya project (a Rust framework for developing eBPF programs). We did eventually move the control plane (specifically) to Golang however, so that we could take advantage of the Kubebuilder and controller-runtime ecosystems. Additionally, we augmented our custom program loader (in eBPF, you generally write loaders that load your BPF byte code into the kernel) with bpfman : a project adjacent to us in the Rust + eBPF ecosystem, which helps solve several security and ergonomic problems with managing BPF programs on Linux systems. After the recently completed license review process , which provided a blanket exception for the use of dual licensed eBPF in CNCF code, the project became officially part of Kubernetes and interest has been growing. We have several goals for the project which revolve around the continued development of Gateway API, with a specific focus on helping mature Layer 4 support (e.</description></item><item><title>Blog: Kubernetes supports running kube-proxy in an unprivileged container</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2024-01-05-blog-kubernetes-supports-running-kube-proxy-in-an-unprivileged-container/</link><pubDate>Fri, 05 Jan 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2024-01-05-blog-kubernetes-supports-running-kube-proxy-in-an-unprivileged-container/</guid><description>This post describes how the &amp;ndash;init-only flag to kube-proxy can be used to run the main kube-proxy container in a stricter securityContext , by performing the configuration that requires privileged mode in a separate init container. Since Windows doesn’t have the equivalent of capabilities , this only works on Linux. The kube-proxy Pod still only meets the privileged Pod Security Standard , but there is still an improvement because the running container doesn’t need to run privileged. Please note that kube-proxy can be installed in different ways. The examples below assume that kube-proxy is run from a pod, but similar changes could be made in clusters where it is run as a system service. It is undesirable to run a server container like kube-proxy in privileged mode. Security aware users wants to use capabilities instead. If kube-proxy is installed as a POD, the initialization requires “privileged” mode, mostly for setting sysctl’s. However, kube-proxy only tries to set the sysctl’s if they don’t already have the right values. In theory, then, if a privileged init container set the sysctls to the right values, then kube-proxy could run unprivileged. The problem is to know what to setup. Until now the only option has been to read the source to see what changes kube-proxy would have made, but with &amp;ndash;init-only you can have kube-proxy itself do the setup exactly as on a normal start, and then exit.</description></item><item><title>Blog: Contextual logging in Kubernetes 1.29: Better troubleshooting and enhanced logging</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2023-12-20-blog-contextual-logging-in-kubernetes-1-29-better-troubleshooting-and-enhanced-l/</link><pubDate>Wed, 20 Dec 2023 09:30:00 -0800</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2023-12-20-blog-contextual-logging-in-kubernetes-1-29-better-troubleshooting-and-enhanced-l/</guid><description>On behalf of the Structured Logging Working Group and SIG Instrumentation , we are pleased to announce that the contextual logging feature introduced in Kubernetes v1. 24 has now been successfully migrated to two components (kube-scheduler and kube-controller-manager) as well as some directories. This feature aims to provide more useful logs for better troubleshooting of Kubernetes and to empower developers to enhance Kubernetes. Contextual logging is based on the go-logr API. The key idea is that libraries are passed a logger instance by their caller and use that for logging instead of accessing a global logger. The binary decides the logging implementation, not the libraries. The go-logr API is designed around structured logging and supports attaching additional information to a logger. This enables additional use cases: The caller can attach additional information to a logger: When passing this extended logger into a function, and the function uses it instead of the global logger, the additional information is then included in all log entries, without having to modify the code that generates the log entries. This is useful in highly parallel applications where it can become hard to identify all log entries for a certain operation, because the output from different operations gets interleaved. When running unit tests, log output can be associated with the current test. Then, when a test fails, only the log output of the failed test gets shown by go test. That output can also be more verbose by default because it will not get shown for successful tests.</description></item><item><title>Blog: Spotlight on SIG Testing</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2023-11-24-blog-spotlight-on-sig-testing/</link><pubDate>Fri, 24 Nov 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2023-11-24-blog-spotlight-on-sig-testing/</guid><description>Welcome to another edition of the SIG spotlight blog series, where we highlight the incredible work being done by various Special Interest Groups (SIGs) within the Kubernetes project. In this edition, we turn our attention to SIG Testing , a group interested in effective testing of Kubernetes and automating away project toil. SIG Testing focus on creating and running tools and infrastructure that make it easier for the community to write and run tests, and to contribute, analyze and act upon test results. To gain some insights into SIG Testing, Sandipan Panda spoke with Michelle Shepardson , a senior software engineer at Google and a chair of SIG Testing, and Patrick Ohly , a software engineer and architect at Intel and a SIG Testing Tech Lead. Sandipan: Could you tell us a bit about yourself, your role, and how you got involved in the Kubernetes project and SIG Testing? Michelle: Hi! I’m Michelle, a senior software engineer at Google. I first got involved in Kubernetes through working on tooling for SIG Testing, like the external instance of TestGrid. I’m part of oncall for TestGrid and Prow, and am now a chair for the SIG. Patrick: Hello! I work as a software engineer and architect in a team at Intel which focuses on open source Cloud Native projects. When I ramped up on Kubernetes to develop a storage driver, my very first question was “how do I test it in a cluster and how do I log information?” That interest led to various enhancement proposals until I had (re)written enough code that also took over official roles as SIG Testing Tech Lead (for the E2E framework ) and structured logging WG lead. Sandipan: Testing is a field in which multiple approaches and tools exist; how did you arrive at the existing practices? Patrick: I can’t speak about the early days because I wasn’t around yet 😆, but looking back at some of the commit history it’s pretty obvious that developers just took what was available and started using it. For E2E testing, that was Ginkgo+Gomega. Some hacks were necessary, for example around cleanup after a test run and for categorising tests.</description></item><item><title>Blog: Kubernetes Contributor Summit: Behind-the-scenes</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2023-11-03-blog-kubernetes-contributor-summit-behind-the-scenes/</link><pubDate>Fri, 03 Nov 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2023-11-03-blog-kubernetes-contributor-summit-behind-the-scenes/</guid><description>Every year, just before the official start of KubeCon+CloudNativeCon, there’s a special event that has a very special place in the hearts of those organizing and participating in it: the Kubernetes Contributor Summit. To find out why, and to provide a behind-the-scenes perspective, we interview Noah Abrahams, whom amongst other roles was the co-lead for the Kubernetes Contributor Summit in 2023. Frederico Muñoz (FSM) : Hello Noah, and welcome. Could you start by introducing yourself and telling us how you got involved in Kubernetes? Noah Abrahams (NA) : I’ve been in this space for quite a while. I got started in IT in the mid 90’s, and I’ve been working in the “Cloud” space for about 15 years. It was, frankly, through a combination of sheer luck (being in the right place at the right time) and having good mentors to pull me into those places (thanks, Tim!), that I ended up at a startup called Apprenda in 2016. While I was there, they pivoted into Kubernetes, and it was the best thing that could have happened to my career. It was around v1. 2 and someone asked me if I could give a presentation on Kubernetes concepts at “my local meetup” in Las Vegas. The meetup didn’t exist yet, so I created it, and got involved in the wider community. One thing led to another, and soon I was involved in ContribEx, joined the release team, was doing booth duty for the CNCF, became an ambassador, and here we are today. FM : Before leading the organisation of the KCSEU 2023, how many other Contributor Summits were you a part of? NA : I was involved in four or five before taking the lead.</description></item><item><title>Blog: Spotlight on SIG Architecture: Production Readiness</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2023-11-02-blog-spotlight-on-sig-architecture-production-readiness/</link><pubDate>Thu, 02 Nov 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2023-11-02-blog-spotlight-on-sig-architecture-production-readiness/</guid><description>This is the second interview of a SIG Architecture Spotlight series that will cover the different subprojects. In this blog, we will cover the SIG Architecture: Production Readiness subproject. In this SIG Architecture spotlight, we talked with Wojciech Tyczynski (Google), lead of the Production Readiness subproject. Frederico (FSM) : Hello Wojciech, could you tell us a bit about yourself, your role and how you got involved in Kubernetes? Wojciech Tyczynski (WT) : I started contributing to Kubernetes in January 2015. At that time, Google (where I was and still am working) decided to start a Kubernetes team in the Warsaw office (in addition to already existing teams in California and Seattle). I was lucky enough to be one of the seeding engineers for that team. After two months of onboarding and helping with different tasks across the project towards 1. 0 launch, I took ownership of the scalability area and I was leading Kubernetes to support clusters with 5000 nodes. I’m still involved in SIG Scalability as its Technical Lead. That was the start of a journey since scalability is such a cross-cutting topic, and I started contributing to many other areas including, over time, to SIG Architecture. FSM : In SIG Architecture, why specifically the Production Readiness subproject? Was it something you had in mind from the start, or was it an unexpected consequence of your initial involvement in scalability? WT : After reaching that milestone of Kubernetes supporting 5000-node clusters , one of the goals was to ensure that Kubernetes would not degrade its scalability properties over time. While non-scalable implementation is always fixable, designing non-scalable APIs or contracts is problematic.</description></item><item><title>Blog: A Quick Recap of 2023 China Kubernetes Contributor Summit</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2023-10-20-blog-a-quick-recap-of-2023-china-kubernetes-contributor-summit/</link><pubDate>Fri, 20 Oct 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2023-10-20-blog-a-quick-recap-of-2023-china-kubernetes-contributor-summit/</guid><description>On September 26, 2023, the first day of KubeCon + CloudNativeCon + Open Source Summit China 2023 , nearly 50 contributors gathered in Shanghai for the Kubernetes Contributor Summit. All participants in the 2023 Kubernetes Contributor Summit This marked the first in-person offline gathering held in China after three years of the pandemic. The event began with welcome speeches from Kevin Wang from Huawei Cloud, one of the co-chairs of KubeCon, and Puja from Giant Swarm. Following the opening remarks, the contributors introduced themselves briefly. Most attendees were from China, while some contributors had made the journey from Europe and the United States specifically for the conference. Technical experts from companies such as Microsoft, Intel, Huawei, as well as emerging forces like DaoCloud, were present. Laughter and cheerful voices filled the room, regardless of whether English was spoken with European or American accents or if conversations were carried out in authentic Chinese language. This created an atmosphere of comfort, joy, respect, and anticipation. Past contributions brought everyone closer, and mutual recognition and accomplishments made this offline gathering possible. Face to face meeting in Shanghai The attending contributors were no longer just GitHub IDs; they transformed into vivid faces. From sitting together and capturing group photos to attempting to identify “Who is who,” a loosely connected collective emerged. This team structure, although loosely knit and free-spirited, was established to pursue shared dreams.</description></item><item><title>Blog: Spotlight on SIG Architecture: Conformance</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2023-10-05-blog-spotlight-on-sig-architecture-conformance/</link><pubDate>Thu, 05 Oct 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2023-10-05-blog-spotlight-on-sig-architecture-conformance/</guid><description>This is the first interview of a SIG Architecture Spotlight series that will cover the different subprojects. We start with the SIG Architecture: Conformance subproject In this SIG Architecture spotlight, we talked with Riaan Kleinhans (ii-Team), Lead for the Conformance sub-project. Frederico (FSM) : Hello Riaan, and welcome! For starters, tell us a bit about yourself, your role and how you got involved in Kubernetes. Riaan Kleinhans (RK) : Hi! My name is Riaan Kleinhans and I live in South Africa. I am the Project manager for the ii-Team in New Zealand. When I joined ii the plan was to move to New Zealand in April 2020 and then Covid happened. Fortunately, being a flexible and dynamic team we were able to make it work remotely and in very different time zones. The ii. nz team have been tasked with managing the Kubernetes Conformance testing technical debt and writing tests to clear the technical debt. I stepped into the role of project manager to be the link between monitoring, test writing and the community. Through that work I had the privilege of meeting the late Dan Kohn in those first months, his enthusiasm about the work we were doing was a great inspiration. FSM : Thank you - so, your involvement in SIG Architecture started because of the conformance work? RK : SIG Architecture is the home for the Kubernetes Conformance subproject.</description></item><item><title>Blog: Announcing the 2023 Steering Committee Election Results</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2023-10-02-blog-announcing-the-2023-steering-committee-election-results/</link><pubDate>Mon, 02 Oct 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2023-10-02-blog-announcing-the-2023-steering-committee-election-results/</guid><description>The 2023 Steering Committee Election is now complete.

In this blog post, we’ll be shining a spotlight on the Special Interest Group for Contributor Experience (SIG ContribEx), an essential component of the Kubernetes project. SIG ContribEx in Kubernetes is responsible for developing and maintaining a healthy and productive community of contributors to the project. This involves identifying and addressing bottlenecks that may hinder the project’s growth and feature velocity, such as pull request latency and the number of open pull requests and issues. SIG ContribEx works to improve the overall contributor experience by creating and maintaining guidelines, tools, and processes that facilitate collaboration and communication among contributors. They also focus on community building and support, including outreach programs and mentorship initiatives to onboard and retain new contributors. Ultimately, the role of SIG ContribEx is to foster a welcoming and inclusive environment that encourages contribution and supports the long-term sustainability of the Kubernetes project. In this blog post, Fyka Ansari interviews Kaslin Fields , a DevRel Engineer at Google, who is a chair of SIG ContribEx, and Madhav Jivrajani , a Software Engineer at VMWare who serves as a SIG ContribEx Tech Lead. This interview covers various aspects of SIG ContribEx, including current initiatives, exciting developments, and how interested individuals can get involved and contribute to the group. It provides valuable insights into the workings of SIG ContribEx and highlights the importance of its role in the Kubernetes ecosystem. Fyka: Let’s start by diving into your background and how you got involved in the Kubernetes ecosystem. Can you tell us more about that journey? Kaslin: I first got involved in the Kubernetes ecosystem through my mentor, Jonathan Rippy, who introduced me to containers during my early days in tech. Eventually, I transitioned to a team working with containers, which sparked my interest in Kubernetes when it was announced.</description></item><item><title>Blog: Spotlight on SIG CLI</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2023-07-20-blog-spotlight-on-sig-cli/</link><pubDate>Thu, 20 Jul 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2023-07-20-blog-spotlight-on-sig-cli/</guid><description>In the world of Kubernetes, managing containerized applications at scale requires powerful and efficient tools. The command-line interface (CLI) is an integral part of any developer or operator’s toolkit, offering a convenient and flexible way to interact with a Kubernetes cluster. SIG CLI plays a crucial role in improving the Kubernetes CLI experience by focusing on the development and enhancement of kubectl , the primary command-line tool for Kubernetes. In this SIG CLI Spotlight, Arpit Agrawal, SIG ContribEx-Comms team member, talked with Katrina Verey , Tech Lead &amp;amp; Chair of SIG CLI,and Maciej Szulik , SIG CLI Batch Lead, about SIG CLI, current projects, challenges and how anyone can get involved. So, whether you are a seasoned Kubernetes enthusiast or just getting started, understanding the significance of SIG CLI will undoubtedly enhance your Kubernetes journey. Arpit : Could you tell us a bit about yourself, your role, and how you got involved in SIG CLI? Maciej : I’m one of the technical leads for SIG-CLI. I was working on Kubernetes in multiple areas since 2014, and in 2018 I got appointed a lead. Katrina : I’ve been working with Kubernetes as an end-user since 2016, but it was only in late 2019 that I discovered how well SIG CLI aligned with my experience from internal projects. I started regularly attending meetings and made a few small PRs, and by 2021 I was working more deeply with the Kustomize team specifically. Later that year, I was appointed to my current roles as subproject owner for Kustomize and KRM Functions, and as SIG CLI Tech Lead and Chair. Arpit : Thank you! Could you share with us the purpose and goals of SIG CLI? Maciej : Our charter has the most detailed description, but in few words, we handle all CLI tooling that helps you manage your Kubernetes manifests and interact with your Kubernetes clusters. Arpit : I see.</description></item><item><title>Blog: Spotlight on SIG Network</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2023-05-09-blog-spotlight-on-sig-network/</link><pubDate>Tue, 09 May 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2023-05-09-blog-spotlight-on-sig-network/</guid><description>Networking is one of the core pillars of Kubernetes, and the Special Interest Group for Networking (SIG Network) is responsible for developing and maintaining the networking features of Kubernetes. It covers all aspects to ensure Kubernetes provides a reliable and scalable network infrastructure for containerized applications. In this SIG Network spotlight, Sujay Dey talked with Shane Utt , Software Engineer at Kong, chair of SIG Network and maintainer of Gateway API, on different aspects of the SIG, what are the exciting things going on and how anyone can get involved and contribute here. Sujay : Hello, and first of all, thanks for the opportunity of learning more about SIG Network. I would love to hear your story, so could you please tell us a bit about yourself, your role, and how you got involved in Kubernetes, especially in SIG Network? Shane : Hello! Thank you for reaching out. My Kubernetes journey started while I was working for a small data centre: we were early adopters of Kubernetes and focused on using Kubernetes to provide SaaS products. That experience led to my next position developing a distribution of Kubernetes with a focus on networking. During this period in my career, I was active in SIG Network (predominantly as a consumer). When I joined Kong my role in the community changed significantly, as Kong actively encourages upstream participation. I greatly increased my engagement and contributions to the Gateway API project during those years, and eventually became a maintainer. I care deeply about this community and the future of our technology, so when a chair position for the SIG became available, I volunteered my time immediately. I’ve enjoyed working on Kubernetes over the better part of a decade and I want to continue to do my part to ensure our community and technology continues to flourish.</description></item><item><title>Blog: E2E Testing Best Practices, Reloaded</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2023-04-12-blog-e2e-testing-best-practices-reloaded/</link><pubDate>Wed, 12 Apr 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2023-04-12-blog-e2e-testing-best-practices-reloaded/</guid><description>End-to-end (E2E) testing in Kubernetes is how the project validates functionality with real clusters. Contributors sooner or later encounter it when asked to write E2E tests for new features or to help with debugging test failures. Cluster admins or vendors might run the conformance tests, a subset of all tests in the E2E test suite. The underlying E2E framework for writing these E2E tests has been around for a long time. Functionality was added to it as needed, leading to code that became hard to maintain and use. The testing commons WG started cleaning it up, but dissolved before completely achieving their goals. After the migration to Gingko v2 in Kubernetes 1. 25, I picked up several of the loose ends and started untangling them. This blog post is a summary of those changes. Some of this content is also found in the Kubernetes contributor document about writing good E2E tests and gets reproduced here to raise awareness that the document has been updated. At the moment, the framework is used in-tree for testing against a cluster ( test/e2e ), testing kubeadm ( test/e2e_kubeadm ) and kubelet ( test/e2e_node ). The goal is to make the core test/e2e/framework a package that has no dependencies on internal code and that can be used in different E2E suites without polluting them with features or options that make no sense for them.</description></item><item><title>Blog: From Zero to Kubernets Subproject Lead</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2023-03-29-blog-from-zero-to-kubernets-subproject-lead/</link><pubDate>Wed, 29 Mar 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2023-03-29-blog-from-zero-to-kubernets-subproject-lead/</guid><description>Getting started in any open-source community can be daunting, especially if it’s a big one like Kubernetes. I wrote this post to share my experience and encourage others to join up. All it takes is some curiosity and a willingness to show up! Here’s how my journey unfolded at a high level: First things first. What are you interested in learning more about? There are so many wonderful SIGs and working groups in the Kubernetes community: there’s something for everyone. And continuing to show up and participate will be so much easier if you think what you are doing is interesting. Likewise, continued participation is what keeps the community thriving, so that interest will drive you to have more of an impact. Also: it’s ok to show up knowing nothing! I remember showing up knowing very little about Kubernetes or how the community itself worked. And while I know more about how the community functions today, I am still learning all the time about it and the project. Fortunately, the community is full of friendly people who want to help you learn. Learning as you go is expected and celebrated. When you raise your hand to do something, even if you know nothing, people will cheer and help you along the way. This method was my exact story.</description></item><item><title>Blog: Introducing KWOK: Kubernetes WithOut Kubelet</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2023-03-01-blog-introducing-kwok-kubernetes-without-kubelet/</link><pubDate>Wed, 01 Mar 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2023-03-01-blog-introducing-kwok-kubernetes-without-kubelet/</guid><description>Author: Shiming Zhang (DaoCloud), Wei Huang (Apple), Yibo Zhuang (Apple) Have you ever wondered how to set up a cluster of thousands of nodes just in seconds, how to simulate real nodes with a low resource footprint, and how to test your Kubernetes controller at scale without spending much on infrastructure?

In the context of Kubernetes, having best practices for cluster observability across all Kubernetes components is crucial. SIG Instrumentation helps to address this issue by providing best practices and tools that all other SIGs use to instrument Kubernetes components-like the API server , scheduler , kubelet and kube-controller-manager. In this SIG Instrumentation spotlight, Imran Noor Mohamed , SIG ContribEx-Comms tech lead talked with Elana Hashman , and Han Kang , chairs of SIG Instrumentation, on how the SIG is organized, what are the current challenges and how anyone can get involved and contribute. Imran (INM) : Hello, thank you for the opportunity of learning more about SIG Instrumentation. Could you tell us a bit about yourself, your role, and how you got involved in SIG Instrumentation? Han (HK) : I started in SIG Instrumentation in 2018, and became a chair in 2020. I primarily got involved with SIG instrumentation due to a number of upstream issues with metrics which ended up affecting GKE in bad ways. As a result, we ended up launching an initiative to stabilize our metrics and make metrics a proper API. Elana (EH) : I also joined SIG Instrumentation in 2018 and became a chair at the same time as Han. I was working as a site reliability engineer (SRE) on bare metal Kubernetes clusters and was working to build out our observability stack. I encountered some issues with label joins where Kubernetes metrics didn’t match kube-state-metrics ( KSM ) and started participating in SIG meetings to improve things. I helped test performance improvements to kube-state-metrics and ultimately coauthored a KEP for overhauling metrics in the 1.</description></item><item><title>Blog: Prow and Tide for Kubernetes Contributors</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2022-12-12-blog-prow-and-tide-for-kubernetes-contributors/</link><pubDate>Mon, 12 Dec 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2022-12-12-blog-prow-and-tide-for-kubernetes-contributors/</guid><description>Authors: Chris Short , Frederico Muñoz In my work in the Kubernetes world, I look up a label or Prow command often. The systems behind the scenes ( Prow and Tide ) are here to help Kubernetes Contributors get stuff done. Labeling which SIG, WG, or subproject is as important as the issue or PR having someone assigned. To quote the docs , “Tide is a Prow component for managing a pool of GitHub PRs that match a given set of criteria. It will automatically retest PRs that meet the criteria (’tide comes in’) and automatically merge them when they have up-to-date passing test results (’tide goes out’). ” What actually prompted this article is the awesomely amazing folks on the Contributor Comms team saying, “I need to squash my commits and push that. ” Which immediately made me remember the wonder of the Tide label: tide/merge-method-squash. Contributing to Kubernetes will, most of the time, involve some kind of git-based action, specifically on the Kubernetes GitHub. This can be an obstacle to those less exposed to git and/or GitHub, and is especially noticeable when we’re dealing with non-code contributions (documentation, blog posts, etc. ). When a contributor submits something, it will generally be through a pull request. When it comes to how the change will go from request to approval, there are a number of considerations that must be made, such as: These are some of the main tasks in which Tide will help, allowing us to use the GitHub interface for these tasks (and more), making the actions more visible to the community (since they are visible as plain comments in the GitHub discussion), and allowing us to manage contributions without necessarily having to clone git repositories or having to manually issue git commands.</description></item><item><title>Blog: Implementing the Auto-refreshing Official Kubernetes CVE Feed</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2022-09-12-blog-implementing-the-auto-refreshing-official-kubernetes-cve-feed/</link><pubDate>Mon, 12 Sep 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2022-09-12-blog-implementing-the-auto-refreshing-official-kubernetes-cve-feed/</guid><description>Author : Pushkar Joglekar (VMware) Accompanying the release of Kubernetes v1. 25, we announced availability of an official CVE feed as an alpha feature. This blog will cover how we implemented this feature. An auto-refreshing CVE feed allows users and implementers to programmatically fetch the list of CVEs announced by the Kubernetes SRC (Security Response Committee). To ensure freshness and minimal maintainer overhead, the feed updates automatically by fetching the CVE related information from the CVE announcement GitHub Issues. Creating these issues is already part of the existing Security Response Committee (SRC) workflow. Until December 2021, it was not possible to filter for issues or PRs that are tied to CVEs announced by Kubernetes SRC. We added a new label, official-cve-feed to address that, and SIG-Security labelled relevant issues with it. The in-scope issues are closed issues for which there is a CVE ID(s) and is officially announced as a Kubernetes security vulnerability by SRC. You can now filter on all of these issues and find them here. For future security vulnerabilities, we added the label to the SRC playbook so that all the future in-scope issues will automatically have this label. For the next step, we created a prow job in order to periodically query the GitHub REST API and pull the relevant issues.</description></item><item><title>Blog: Enhancements Opt-in Process Change for v1.26</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2022-09-09-blog-enhancements-opt-in-process-change-for-v1-26/</link><pubDate>Fri, 09 Sep 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2022-09-09-blog-enhancements-opt-in-process-change-for-v1-26/</guid><description>Author: Grace Nguyen Since the inception of the Kubernetes release team, we have used a spreadsheet to keep track of enhancements for the release. The project has scaled massively in the past few years, with almost a hundred enhancements collected for the 1. 24 release. This process has become error-prone and time consuming. A lot of manual work is required from the release team and the SIG leads to populate KEPs data in the sheet. We have received continuous feedback from our contributors to streamline the process. Starting with the 1. 26 release, we are replacing the enhancements tracking spreadsheet with an automated GitHub project board. The board is populated with a script gathering all KEP issues in the kubernetes/enhancements repo that have the label lead-opted-in. The enhancements’ stage and SIG information will also be automatically pulled from the KEP issue. After the KEP is populated on the Github Project Board, the Enhancements team will manually update the KEP with the label tracked/yes , tracked/no and on occasions, tracked/out-of-tree. The tracked label signifies qualification for the closest approaching milestone.</description></item><item><title>Blog: Spotlight on SIG Storage</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2022-08-22-blog-spotlight-on-sig-storage/</link><pubDate>Mon, 22 Aug 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2022-08-22-blog-spotlight-on-sig-storage/</guid><description>Since the very beginning of Kubernetes, the topic of persistent data and how to address the requirement of stateful applications has been an important topic. Support for stateless deployments was natural, present from the start, and garnered attention, becoming very well-known. Work on better support for stateful applications was also present from early on, with each release increasing the scope of what could be run on Kubernetes. Message queues, databases, clustered filesystems: these are some examples of the solutions that have different storage requirements and that are, today, increasingly deployed in Kubernetes. Dealing with ephemeral and persistent storage, local or remote, file or block, from many different vendors, while considering how to provide the needed resiliency and data consistency that users expect, all of this is under SIG Storage’s umbrella. In this SIG Storage spotlight, Frederico Muñoz (Cloud &amp;amp; Architecture Lead at SAS) talked with Xing Yang , Tech Lead at VMware and co-chair of SIG Storage, on how the SIG is organized, what are the current challenges and how anyone can get involved and contribute. Frederico (FSM) : Hello, thank you for the opportunity of learning more about SIG Storage. Could you tell us a bit about yourself, your role, and how you got involved in SIG Storage. Xing Yang (XY) : I am a Tech Lead at VMware, working on Cloud Native Storage. I am also a Co-Chair of SIG Storage.

This post features four outstanding contributors from China, who have played diverse leadership and community roles in the upstream Kubernetes project. So, without further ado, let’s get straight to the article. Andy Zhang currently works for Microsoft China at the Shanghai site. His main focus is on Kubernetes storage drivers. Andy started contributing to Kubernetes about 5 years ago. He states that as he is working in Azure Kubernetes Service team and spends most of his time contributing to the Kubernetes community project. Now he is the main contributor of quite a lot Kubernetes subprojects such as Kubernetes cloud provider code. His open source contributions are mainly self-motivated. In the last two years he has mentored a few students contributing to Kubernetes through the LFX Mentorship program, some of whom got jobs due to their expertise and contributions on Kubernetes projects. Andy is an active member of the China Kubernetes community. He adds that the Kubernetes community has a good guide about how to become members, code reviewers, approvers and finally when he found out that some open source projects are in the very early stage, he actively contributed to those projects and became the project maintainer.</description></item><item><title>Blog: Enhancing Kubernetes one KEP at a Time</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2022-08-11-blog-enhancing-kubernetes-one-kep-at-a-time/</link><pubDate>Thu, 11 Aug 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2022-08-11-blog-enhancing-kubernetes-one-kep-at-a-time/</guid><description>Author: Ryler Hockenbury (Mastercard) Did you know that Kubernetes v1. 24 has 46 enhancements ? That’s a lot of new functionality packed into a 4-month release cycle. The Kubernetes release team coordinates the logistics of the release, from remediating test flakes to publishing updated docs. It’s a ton of work, but they always deliver. The release team comprises around 30 people across six subteams - Bug Triage, CI Signal, Enhancements, Release Notes, Communications, and Docs. Each of these subteams manages a component of the release. This post will focus on the role of the enhancements subteam and how you can get involved. Great question. We’ll get to that in a second but first, let’s talk about how features are managed in Kubernetes. Each new feature requires a Kubernetes Enhancement Proposal - KEP for short. KEPs are small structured design documents that provide a way to propose and coordinate new features. The KEP author describes the motivation, design (and alternatives), risks, and tests - then community members provide feedback to build consensus.</description></item><item><title>Blog: Spotlight on SIG Docs</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2022-08-02-blog-spotlight-on-sig-docs/</link><pubDate>Tue, 02 Aug 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2022-08-02-blog-spotlight-on-sig-docs/</guid><description>Author: Purneswar Prasad The official documentation is the go-to source for any open source project. For Kubernetes, it’s an ever-evolving Special Interest Group (SIG) with people constantly putting in their efforts to make details about the project easier to consume for new contributors and users. SIG Docs publishes the official documentation on kubernetes. io which includes, but is not limited to, documentation of the core APIs, core architectural details, and CLI tools shipped with the Kubernetes release. To learn more about the work of SIG Docs and its future ahead in shaping the community, I have summarised my conversation with the co-chairs, Divya Mohan (DM), Rey Lejano (RL) and Natali Vlatko (NV), who ran through the SIG’s goals and how fellow contributors can help. SIG Docs is the special interest group for documentation for the Kubernetes project on kubernetes. io, generating reference guides for the Kubernetes API, kubeadm and kubectl as well as maintaining the official website’s infrastructure and analytics. The remit of their work also extends to docs releases, translation of docs, improvement and adding new features to existing documentation, pushing and reviewing content for the official Kubernetes blog and engaging with the Release Team for each cycle to get docs and blogs reviewed. Blogs : This subproject highlights new or graduated Kubernetes enhancements, community reports, SIG updates or any relevant news to the Kubernetes community such as thought leadership, tutorials and project updates, such as the Dockershim removal and removal of PodSecurityPolicy, which is upcoming in the 1. 25 release. Tim Bannister, one of the SIG Docs tech leads, does awesome work and is a major force when pushing contributions through to the docs and blogs. Localization : With this subproject, the Kubernetes community has been able to achieve greater inclusivity and diversity among both users and contributors.</description></item><item><title>Blog: Contextual Logging in Kubernetes 1.24</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2022-05-25-blog-contextual-logging-in-kubernetes-1-24/</link><pubDate>Wed, 25 May 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2022-05-25-blog-contextual-logging-in-kubernetes-1-24/</guid><description>Authors: Patrick Ohly (Intel) The Structured Logging Working Group has added new capabilities to the logging infrastructure in Kubernetes 1. 24. This blog post explains how developers can take advantage of those to make log output more useful and how they can get involved with improving Kubernetes. The goal of structured logging is to replace C-style formatting and the resulting opaque log strings with log entries that have a well-defined syntax for storing message and parameters separately, for example as a JSON struct. When using the traditional klog text output format for structured log calls, strings were originally printed with \n escape sequences, except when embedded inside a struct. For structs, log entries could still span multiple lines, with no clean way to split the log stream into individual entries: Now, the &amp;lt; and &amp;gt; markers along with indentation are used to ensure that splitting at a klog header at the start of a line is reliable and the resulting output is human-readable: Note that the log message itself is printed with quoting. It is meant to be a fixed string that identifies a log entry, so newlines should be avoided there. Before Kubernetes 1. 24, some log calls in kube-scheduler still used klog. Info for multi-line strings to avoid the unreadable output. Now all log calls have been updated to support structured logging. Contextual logging is based on the go-logr API.</description></item><item><title>Blog: February 2022 Community Meeting Highlights</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2022-05-05-blog-february-2022-community-meeting-highlights/</link><pubDate>Thu, 05 May 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2022-05-05-blog-february-2022-community-meeting-highlights/</guid><description>Author: Nigel Brown (VMware) We just had our first contributor community meeting this year, and it was awesome to be back with you in that format. These meetings will be happening on Zoom once per month, on the third Thursday of the month - that should be available in your calendar if you’re subscribed to the k-dev mailing list. Community meetings are an opportunity for you to meet synchronously with other members of the Kubernetes community to talk about issues of general appeal. This meeting kicked off with an update on the 1. 24 release with Xander Grzywinski, who is one of the shadows for the release team leads. This release is scheduled for April 19, 2022 with a code freeze scheduled for March 30th. At the time of the meeting there were 66 individual enhancements included, as well as bug fixes. You can join the conversation on Slack in #sig-release. Update: Kubernetes 1. 24 was delayed and released on May 3, 2022. From there, the discussion moved to the dockershim removal and the docs updates we need to make around that, with the discussion led by Kat Cosgrove. The main takeaway was that if you have a platform, talk to folks about this change.</description></item><item><title>Blog: K8s CI Bot Helper Job: automating "make update"</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2022-03-15-blog-k8s-ci-bot-helper-job-automating-make-update/</link><pubDate>Tue, 15 Mar 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2022-03-15-blog-k8s-ci-bot-helper-job-automating-make-update/</guid><description>Authors: Subhasmita Swain , Davanum Srinivas If you are contributing to the Kubernetes project and are developing on a Windows PC, it is conceivable that you will encounter certain issues that will cause your pull request to get held up by test failures. This article describes a workaround for a similar issue I encountered when attempting to have my modifications approved and merged into the master branch. While contributing to kubernetes/kubernetes for some minor documentation changes, the pushed changes needed to be updated with other verified contents of the entire documentation. So, in order for the change to take effect, a single command must be performed to ensure that all tests on the CI pipeline pass. The single command make update runs all presubmission verification tests. For some reason on the “Windows Subsystem for Linux” environment the tests, specifically the update-openapi-spec. sh script, failed (in my case, take a look at the conversation here ), eventually failing the pull-kubernetes-verify tests. You might encounter the following on your PR The tests failing the particular issue: Consecutively, Additionally one can check the failed test via the link provided under details in the above image. Run the failing. sh scripts individually known from the CI job output, to generate the expected files to fix up the failures.

This post will feature four outstanding contributors from the Australia and New Zealand regions, who have played diverse leadership and community roles in the Upstream Kubernetes project. So, without further ado, let’s get straight to the article. Caleb Woodbine is currently a member of the ii. nz organisation. He began contributing to the Kubernetes project in 2018 as a member of the Kubernetes Conformance working group. His experience was positive, and he benefited from early guidance from Hippie Hacker , a fellow contributor from New Zealand. He has made major contributions to Kubernetes project since then through SIG k8s-infra and k8s-conformance working group. Caleb is also a co-organizer of the CloudNative NZ community events, which aim to expand the reach of Kubernetes project throughout New Zealand in order to encourage technical education and improved employment opportunities. There need to be more outreach in APAC and the educators and universities must pick up Kubernetes, as they are very slow and about 8+ years out of date. NZ tends to rather pay overseas than educate locals on the latest cloud tech Locally. Dylan Graham is a cloud engineer from Adeliade, Australia.</description></item><item><title>Blog: SIG Node CI Subproject Celebrates Two Years of Test Improvements</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2022-02-16-blog-sig-node-ci-subproject-celebrates-two-years-of-test-improvements/</link><pubDate>Wed, 16 Feb 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2022-02-16-blog-sig-node-ci-subproject-celebrates-two-years-of-test-improvements/</guid><description>Authors: Sergey Kanzhelev (Google), Elana Hashman (Red Hat) Ensuring the reliability of SIG Node upstream code is a continuous effort that takes a lot of behind-the-scenes effort from many contributors. There are frequent releases of Kubernetes, base operating systems, container runtimes, and test infrastructure that result in a complex matrix that requires attention and steady investment to “keep the lights on. ” In May 2020, the Kubernetes node special interest group (“SIG Node”) organized a new subproject for continuous integration (CI) for node-related code and tests. Since its inauguration, the SIG Node CI subproject has run a weekly meeting, and even the full hour is often not enough to complete triage of all bugs, test-related PRs and issues, and discuss all related ongoing work within the subgroup. Over the past two years, we’ve fixed merge-blocking and release-blocking tests, reducing time to merge Kubernetes contributors’ pull requests thanks to reduced test flakes. When we started, Node test jobs only passed 42% of the time, and through our efforts, we now ensure a consistent &amp;gt;90% job pass rate. We’ve closed 144 test failure issues and merged 176 pull requests just in kubernetes/kubernetes. And we’ve helped subproject participants ascend the Kubernetes contributor ladder, with 3 new org members, 6 new reviewers, and 2 new approvers. The Node CI subproject is an approachable first stop to help new contributors get started with SIG Node. There is a low barrier to entry for new contributors to address high-impact bugs and test fixes, although there is a long road before contributors can climb the entire contributor ladder: it took over a year to establish two new approvers for the group. The complexity of all the different components that power Kubernetes nodes and its test infrastructure requires a sustained investment over a long period for developers to deeply understand the entire system, both at high and low levels of detail. We have several regular contributors at our meetings, however; our reviewers and approvers pool is still small.</description></item><item><title>Blog: Spotlight on SIG Multicluster</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2022-02-04-blog-spotlight-on-sig-multicluster/</link><pubDate>Fri, 04 Feb 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2022-02-04-blog-spotlight-on-sig-multicluster/</guid><description>Authors: Dewan Ahmed (Aiven) and Chris Short (AWS) SIG Multicluster is the Special Interest Group (SIG) focused on how Kubernetes concepts are expanded and used beyond the cluster boundary. Historically, Kubernetes resources only interacted within that boundary - KRU or Kubernetes Resource Universe (not an actual Kubernetes concept). Kubernetes clusters, even now, don’t really know anything about themselves or, about other clusters. Absence of cluster identifiers is a case in point. With the growing adoption of multicloud and multicluster deployments, the work SIG Multicluster doing is gaining a lot of attention. In this article, Jeremy Olmsted-Thompson, Google and Chris Short, AWS discuss the interesting problems SIG Multicluster is solving and how you can get involved. Their initials JOT and CS will be used for brevity. CS : How long has the SIG Multicluster existed and how was the SIG in its infancy? How long have you been with this SIG? JOT : I’ve been around for almost two years in the SIG Multicluster. All I know about the infancy years is from the lore but even in the early days, it was always about solving this same problem. Early efforts have been things like KubeFed. I think there are still folks using KubeFed but it’s a smaller slice. Back then, I think people out there deploying large numbers of Kubernetes clusters were really not at a point where we had a ton of real concrete use cases.</description></item><item><title>Blog: Meet Our Contributors - APAC (India region)</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2022-01-10-blog-meet-our-contributors-apac-india-region/</link><pubDate>Mon, 10 Jan 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2022-01-10-blog-meet-our-contributors-apac-india-region/</guid><description>Authors &amp;amp; Interviewers: Anubhav Vardhan , Atharva Shinde , Avinesh Tripathi , Debabrata Panigrahi , Kunal Verma , Pranshu Srivastava , Pritish Samal , Purneswar Prasad , Vedant Kakde Editor: Priyanka Saggu Good day, everyone 👋 Welcome to the first episode of the APAC edition of the “Meet Our Contributors” blog post series. In this post, we’ll introduce you to five amazing folks from the India region who have been actively contributing to the upstream Kubernetes projects in a variety of ways, as well as being the leaders or maintainers of numerous community initiatives. 💫 Let’s get started, so without further ado… Arsh is currently employed with Okteto as a Developer Experience engineer. As a new contributor, he realised that 1:1 mentorship opportunities were quite beneficial in getting him started with the upstream project. He is presently a CI Signal shadow on the Kubernetes 1. 23 release team. He is also contributing to the SIG Testing and SIG Docs projects, as well as to the cert-manager tools development work that is being done under the aegis of SIG Architecture. To the newcomers, Arsh helps plan their early contributions sustainably. I would encourage folks to contribute in a way that’s sustainable. What I mean by that is that it’s easy to be very enthusiastic early on and take up more stuff than one can actually handle. This can often lead to burnout in later stages. It’s much more sustainable to work on things iteratively.</description></item><item><title>Blog: Announcing the Kubernetes Contributor Celebration 2021</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2021-12-07-blog-announcing-the-kubernetes-contributor-celebration-2021/</link><pubDate>Tue, 07 Dec 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2021-12-07-blog-announcing-the-kubernetes-contributor-celebration-2021/</guid><description>By Debabrata Panigrahi It’s that time of the year again, Yayy!! Like last year, this year also we are back with Kubernetes Contributor Celebration, the annual end of the year celebration, to recognize our achievements and have some fun! It’s a time for us to relax, chat and do something fun with your fellow contributors! To register, please fill out the Registration Form. More details on how to join the event. DevOps Party Games “DevOps Party Games takes the idea of “online party games” and tilts it on its head by adding DevOps-inspired content to existing games, and then streams it live via Twitch for a worldwide audience to watch, comment, and hopefully be entertained. In addition, the hosts (Matt Stratton, Jeremy Meiss, and Dan Maher) will provide color commentary, much like a modern day Cotton McKnight and Pepper Brooks (announcers from Dodgeball). ” There will be a Kubernetes slant for this edition of DevOps Party Games. The Great Cloud Native Bakeoff A virtual cooking event styled after the Great British Bake-off will be held during the Kubernetes Celebration Event. Contestants will have 90 minutes to bake something related to to your Cloud Native experience. Anything goes, as long as the majority of preparation is done live. The competition is open to all skill levels, from baking from a cake mix to grinding your own flour as long as it’s somehow Kubernetes-themed. At the end of the contest, each baked good will be judged on ambition, execution, success, and implementation of a Kubernetes theme. The winner will get a unique, handmade, baking-related prize. We’re looking for cooks of all backgrounds and talents.</description></item><item><title>Blog: Improve your documentation with Mermaid.js diagrams</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2021-12-01-blog-improve-your-documentation-with-mermaid-js-diagrams/</link><pubDate>Wed, 01 Dec 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2021-12-01-blog-improve-your-documentation-with-mermaid-js-diagrams/</guid><description>By Chris Metz and Tim Bannister Topics covered in this blog.

Faster grasp of concepts. A diagram can serve as a visual roadmap for details covered in the accompanying text. Better retention. Humans remember pictures better than words. Most importantly, readers acquire the confidence to explore further. “Wow! Okay I get this. What’s next? Maybe I can contribute. ” There are many drawing tools to choose from. Traditionally, you create a diagram, save it as png or svg file and then embed the file in the documentation.</description></item><item><title>Blog: How to choose a SIG as a non-code Kubernetes contributor</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2021-07-09-blog-how-to-choose-a-sig-as-a-non-code-kubernetes-contributor/</link><pubDate>Fri, 09 Jul 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2021-07-09-blog-how-to-choose-a-sig-as-a-non-code-kubernetes-contributor/</guid><description>By Chris Short Kubernetes contributors aren’t people in capes or part of some secret society. How to start committing to the GitHub repos that make up the project is well documented , yet it remains intimidating for many. A few years ago, I spoke at an event and jokingly said, “Kubernetes is just a bunch of APIs and YAML… I’m a contributor; you don’t believe me?” After that talk, someone pulled me aside and asked if I was the Kubernetes contributor. They wanted to get involved in the community. Then came the real question, “I don’t know which special interest group (SIG) I would work in. ” The SIG you work in depends on your skills and what you want to do with your (or your company’s) free time. I’ll start with myself as an example. I do not code as part of my day-to-day work; I never have. While I have made bits of code into programs here and there, I always had a helping hand. It’s also possible my definition of a coder is busted too. But, I consider myself a non-code contributor to Kubernetes. I’m an Ops person that embraced DevOps early.</description></item><item><title>KubeCon + CloudNativeCon Europe 2026</title><link>https://kubermates.org/events/kubecon-eu-2026/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/events/kubecon-eu-2026/</guid><description/></item><item><title>KubeCon + CloudNativeCon North America 2026</title><link>https://kubermates.org/events/kubecon-na-2026/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/events/kubecon-na-2026/</guid><description/></item><item><title>PlatformCon 2026</title><link>https://kubermates.org/events/platformcon-2026/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/events/platformcon-2026/</guid><description/></item></channel></rss>
