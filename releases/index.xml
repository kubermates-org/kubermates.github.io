Amazon EKS provides two types of insights: Configuration insights and Upgrade insights. Configuration insights identify misconfigurations in your EKS Hybrid Nodes setup that could impair functionality of your cluster or workloads. Upgrade insights identify issues that could impact your ability to upgrade to new versions of Kubernetes. To see the list of insight checks performed and any relevant issues that Amazon EKS has identified, you can call the look in the AWS Management Console, the AWS CLI, AWS SDKs, and Amazon EKS ListInsights API operation. Open the Amazon EKS console. From the cluster list, choose the name of the Amazon EKS cluster for which you want to see the insights. Choose Monitor cluster. Choose the Cluster health tab. In the Configuration insights table, you will see the following columns: Name â The check that was performed by Amazon EKS against the cluster. Insight status â An insight with a status of Error means that there is a misconfiguration that is likely impacting cluster functionality. An insight with a status of Warning means that the configuration doesnât match the documented approach, but that cluster functionality might work if you configured it intentionally.</description></item><item><title>Pre-release v2.9.11-rc1</title><link>https://kubermates.org/releases/2025-08-27-pre-release-v2-9-11-rc1/</link><pubDate>Wed, 27 Aug 2025 17:32:18 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/releases/2025-08-27-pre-release-v2-9-11-rc1/</guid><description>There was an error while loading.

An AWS managed policy is a standalone policy that is created and administered by AWS. AWS managed policies are designed to provide permissions for many common use cases so that you can start assigning permissions to users, groups, and roles. Keep in mind that AWS managed policies might not grant least-privilege permissions for your specific use cases because theyâre available for all AWS customers to use. We recommend that you reduce permissions further by defining customer managed policies that are specific to your use cases. You cannot change the permissions defined in AWS managed policies. If AWS updates the permissions defined in an AWS managed policy, the update affects all principal identities (users, groups, and roles) that the policy is attached to. AWS is most likely to update an AWS managed policy when a new AWS service is launched or new API operations become available for existing services. For more information, see AWS managed policies in the IAM User Guide. You can attach the AmazonEKS_CNI_Policy to your IAM entities. Before you create an Amazon EC2 node group, this policy must be attached to either the node IAM role , or to an IAM role thatâs used specifically by the Amazon VPC CNI plugin for Kubernetes. This is so that it can perform actions on your behalf.</description></item><item><title>v1.31.12+k3s1</title><link>https://kubermates.org/releases/2025-08-26-v1-31-12-k3s1/</link><pubDate>Tue, 26 Aug 2025 18:58:55 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/releases/2025-08-26-v1-31-12-k3s1/</guid><description>This release updates Kubernetes to v1. 31. 12, and fixes a number of issues.

The confused deputy problem is a security issue where an entity that doesnât have permission to perform an action can coerce a more-privileged entity to perform the action. In AWS, cross-service impersonation can result in the confused deputy problem. Cross-service impersonation can occur when one service (the calling service ) calls another service (the called service ). The calling service can be manipulated to use its permissions to act on another customerâs resources in a way it should not otherwise have permission to access. To prevent this, AWS provides tools that help you protect your data for all services with service principals that have been given access to resources in your account. We recommend using the aws:SourceArn , aws:SourceAccount global condition context keys in resource policies to limit the permissions that Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (Amazon EKS) gives another service to the resource. Use aws:SourceArn to associate only one resource with cross-service access. Use aws:SourceAccount to let any resource in that account be associated with the cross-service use. The most effective way to protect against the confused deputy problem is to use the aws:SourceArn global condition context key with the full ARN of the resource. If you donât know the full ARN of the resource or if you are specifying multiple resources, use the aws:SourceArn global context condition key with wildcard characters (&lt;em&gt;) for the unknown portions of the ARN. For example, arn:aws:&lt;servicename&gt;:&lt;/em&gt;:&amp;lt;123456789012&amp;gt;:*.</description></item><item><title>v1.31.12-rc4+rke2r1</title><link>https://kubermates.org/releases/2025-08-18-v1-31-12-rc4-rke2r1/</link><pubDate>Mon, 18 Aug 2025 19:00:33 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/releases/2025-08-18-v1-31-12-rc4-rke2r1/</guid><description>There was an error while loading.

Amazon EKS platform versions represent the capabilities of the Amazon EKS cluster control plane, such as which Kubernetes API server flags are enabled, as well as the current Kubernetes patch version. Each Kubernetes minor version has one or more associated Amazon EKS platform versions. The platform versions for different Kubernetes minor versions are independent. You can retrieve your clusterâs current platform version using the AWS CLI or AWS Management Console. If you have a local cluster on AWS Outposts, see Learn Kubernetes and Amazon EKS platform versions for AWS Outposts instead of this topic. When a new Kubernetes minor version is available in Amazon EKS, such as 1. 33, the initial Amazon EKS platform version for that Kubernetes minor version starts at eks. 1. However, Amazon EKS releases new platform versions periodically to enable new Kubernetes control plane settings and to provide security fixes. When new Amazon EKS platform versions become available for a minor version: The Amazon EKS platform version number is incremented ( eks. &amp;lt;n+1&amp;gt; ).</description></item><item><title>4.20.0-okd-scos.ec.10</title><link>https://kubermates.org/releases/2025-07-29-4-20-0-okd-scos-ec-10/</link><pubDate>Tue, 29 Jul 2025 21:00:36 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/releases/2025-07-29-4-20-0-okd-scos-ec-10/</guid><description>These archives contain the client tooling for OKD on CentOS Stream CoreOS.

By default, the Amazon VPC CNI plugin assigns one IP address to each pod. This IP address is attached to an elastic network interface that handles all incoming and outgoing traffic for the pod. To increase the bandwidth and packet per second rate performance, you can use the Multi-NIC feature of the VPC CNI to configure a multi-homed pod. A multi-homed pod is a single Kubernetes pod that uses multiple network interfaces (and multiple IP addresses). By running a multi-homed pod, you can spread its application traffic across multiple network interfaces by using concurrent connections. This is especially useful for Artificial Intelligence (AI), Machine Learning (ML), and High Performance Computing (HPC) use cases. The following diagram shows a multi-homed pod running on a worker node with multiple network interface cards (NICs) in use. On Amazon EC2, an elastic network interface is a logical networking component in a VPC that represents a virtual network card. For many EC2 instance types, the network interfaces share a single network interface card (NIC) in hardware. This single NIC has a maximum bandwidth and packet per second rate. If the multi-NIC feature is enabled, the VPC CNI doesnât assign IP addresses in bulk, which it does by default.</description></item><item><title>July 14, 2025</title><link>https://kubermates.org/releases/2025-07-14-july-14-2025/</link><pubDate>Mon, 14 Jul 2025 00:00:00 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/releases/2025-07-14-july-14-2025/</guid><description>This page includes release notes for all channels and releases.

An AWS managed policy is a standalone policy that is created and administered by AWS. AWS managed policies are designed to provide permissions for many common use cases so that you can start assigning permissions to users, groups, and roles. Keep in mind that AWS managed policies might not grant least-privilege permissions for your specific use cases because theyâre available for all AWS customers to use. We recommend that you reduce permissions further by defining customer managed policies that are specific to your use cases. You cannot change the permissions defined in AWS managed policies. If AWS updates the permissions defined in an AWS managed policy, the update affects all principal identities (users, groups, and roles) that the policy is attached to. AWS is most likely to update an AWS managed policy when a new AWS service is launched or new API operations become available for existing services. For more information, see AWS managed policies in the IAM User Guide. You can attach the AmazonEKS_CNI_Policy to your IAM entities. Before you create an Amazon EC2 node group, this policy must be attached to either the node IAM role , or to an IAM role thatâs used specifically by the Amazon VPC CNI plugin for Kubernetes. This is so that it can perform actions on your behalf.</description></item><item><title>June 25, 2025</title><link>https://kubermates.org/releases/2025-06-25-june-25-2025/</link><pubDate>Wed, 25 Jun 2025 00:00:00 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/releases/2025-06-25-june-25-2025/</guid><description>This page includes release notes for all channels and releases.

Amazon EKS Node Classes are templates that offer granular control over the configuration of your EKS Auto Mode managed nodes. A Node Class defines infrastructure-level settings that apply to groups of nodes in your EKS cluster, including network configuration, storage settings, and resource tagging. This topic explains how to create and configure a Node Class to meet your specific operational requirements. When you need to customize how EKS Auto Mode provisions and configures EC2 instances beyond the default settings, creating a Node Class gives you precise control over critical infrastructure parameters. For example, you can specify private subnet placement for enhanced security, configure instance ephemeral storage for performance-sensitive workloads, or apply custom tagging for cost allocation. To create a NodeClass , follow these steps: Create a YAML file (for example, nodeclass. yaml ) with your Node Class configuration Apply the configuration to your cluster using kubectl Reference the Node Class in your Node Pool configuration. For more information, see Create a Node Pool for EKS Auto Mode. You need kubectl installed and configured. For more information, see Set up to use Amazon EKS. Hereâs an example Node Class: This NodeClass increases the amount of ephemeral storage on the node.</description></item><item><title>June 12, 2025</title><link>https://kubermates.org/releases/2025-06-12-june-12-2025/</link><pubDate>Thu, 12 Jun 2025 00:00:00 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/releases/2025-06-12-june-12-2025/</guid><description>This page includes release notes for all channels and releases.

When running applications on Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (Amazon EKS), you might need to access AWS resources that exist in different AWS accounts. This guide shows you how to set up cross account access using EKS Pod Identity, which enables your Kubernetes pods to access other AWS resources using target roles. Before you begin, ensure you have completed the following steps: Set up the Amazon EKS Pod Identity Agent Create an EKS Pod Identity role Pod Identity enables applications in your EKS cluster to access AWS resources across accounts through a process called role chaining. When creating a Pod Identity association, you can provide two IAM roles: an EKS Pod Identity role in the same account as your EKS cluster and a Target IAM Role from the account containing your AWS resources you wish to access, (like S3 buckets or RDS Databases). The EKS Pod Identity role must be in your EKS clusterâs account due to IAM PassRole requirements, while the Target IAM Role can be in any AWS account. PassRole enables an AWS entity to delegate role assumption to another service. EKS Pod Identity uses PassRole to connect a role to a Kubernetes service account, requiring both the role and the identity passing it to be in the same AWS account as the EKS cluster. When your application pod needs to access AWS resources, it requests credentials from Pod Identity. Pod Identity then automatically performs two role assumptions in sequence: first assuming the EKS Pod Identity role , then using those credentials to assume the Target IAM Role. This process provides your pod with temporary credentials that have the permissions defined in the target role, allowing secure access to resources in other AWS accounts. Due to caching mechanisms, updates to an IAM role in an existing Pod Identity association may not take effect immediately in the pods running on your EKS cluster.</description></item><item><title>June 10, 2025</title><link>https://kubermates.org/releases/2025-06-10-june-10-2025/</link><pubDate>Tue, 10 Jun 2025 00:00:00 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/releases/2025-06-10-june-10-2025/</guid><description>This page includes release notes for all channels and releases.

This topic helps you to enable private access for your Amazon EKS clusterâs Kubernetes API server endpoint and limit, or completely disable, public access from the internet. When you create a new cluster, Amazon EKS creates an endpoint for the managed Kubernetes API server that you use to communicate with your cluster (using Kubernetes management tools such as kubectl ). By default, this API server endpoint is public to the internet, and access to the API server is secured using a combination of AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) and native Kubernetes Role Based Access Control (RBAC). This endpoint is known as the cluster public endpoint. Also there is a cluster private endpoint. For more information about the cluster private endpoint, see the following section Cluster private endpoint. EKS creates a unique dual-stack endpoint in the following format for new IPv6 clusters that are made after October 2024. An IPv6 cluster is a cluster that you select IPv6 in the IP family ( ipFamily ) setting of the cluster.

An AWS managed policy is a standalone policy that is created and administered by AWS. AWS managed policies are designed to provide permissions for many common use cases so that you can start assigning permissions to users, groups, and roles. Keep in mind that AWS managed policies might not grant least-privilege permissions for your specific use cases because theyâre available for all AWS customers to use. We recommend that you reduce permissions further by defining customer managed policies that are specific to your use cases. You cannot change the permissions defined in AWS managed policies. If AWS updates the permissions defined in an AWS managed policy, the update affects all principal identities (users, groups, and roles) that the policy is attached to. AWS is most likely to update an AWS managed policy when a new AWS service is launched or new API operations become available for existing services. For more information, see AWS managed policies in the IAM User Guide. You can attach the AmazonEKS_CNI_Policy to your IAM entities. Before you create an Amazon EC2 node group, this policy must be attached to either the node IAM role , or to an IAM role thatâs used specifically by the Amazon VPC CNI plugin for Kubernetes. This is so that it can perform actions on your behalf.</description></item><item><title>EKS Hybrid Nodes for existing clusters</title><link>https://kubermates.org/releases/2025-03-31-eks-hybrid-nodes-for-existing-clusters/</link><pubDate>Mon, 31 Mar 2025 19:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/releases/2025-03-31-eks-hybrid-nodes-for-existing-clusters/</guid><description>Help improve this page To contribute to this user guide, choose the Edit this page on GitHub link that is located in the right pane of every page. This topic provides an overview of the available options and describes what to consider when you add, change, or remove the hybrid nodes configuration for an Amazon EKS cluster. To enable an Amazon EKS cluster to use hybrid nodes, add the IP address CIDR ranges of your on-premises node and optionally pod network in the RemoteNetworkConfig configuration. EKS uses this list of CIDRs to enable connectivity between the cluster and your on-premises networks. For a full list of options when updating your cluster configuration, see the UpdateClusterConfig in the Amazon EKS API Reference. You can do any of the following actions to the EKS Hybrid Nodes networking configuration in a cluster: Add remote network configuration to enable EKS Hybrid Nodes in an existing cluster. Add, change, or remove the remote node networks or the remote pod networks in an existing cluster. Remove all remote node network CIDR ranges to disable EKS Hybrid Nodes in an existing cluster. Before enabling your Amazon EKS cluster for hybrid nodes, ensure your environment meets the requirements outlined at Prerequisite setup for hybrid nodes , and detailed at Prepare networking for hybrid nodes , Prepare operating system for hybrid nodes , and Prepare credentials for hybrid nodes. Your cluster must use IPv4 address family. Your cluster must use either API or API_AND_CONFIG_MAP for the cluster authentication mode. The process for modifying the cluster authentication mode is described at Change authentication mode to use access entries.</description></item><item><title>Node health for EKS Hybrid Nodes</title><link>https://kubermates.org/releases/2025-03-31-node-health-for-eks-hybrid-nodes/</link><pubDate>Mon, 31 Mar 2025 19:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/releases/2025-03-31-node-health-for-eks-hybrid-nodes/</guid><description>Help improve this page To contribute to this user guide, choose the Edit this page on GitHub link that is located in the right pane of every page. Node health refers to the operational status and capability of a node to effectively run workloads. A healthy node maintains expected connectivity, has sufficient resources, and can successfully run Pods without disruption. For information on getting details about your nodes, see View the health status of your nodes and Retrieve node logs for a managed node using kubectl and S3. To help with maintaining healthy nodes, Amazon EKS offers the node monitoring agent and node auto repair. The node monitoring agent and node auto repair are only available on Linux. These features arenât available on Windows. The node monitoring agent automatically reads node logs to detect certain health issues. It parses through node logs to detect failures and surfaces various status information about worker nodes. A dedicated NodeCondition is applied on the worker nodes for each category of issues detected, such as storage and networking issues. Descriptions of detected health issues are made available in the observability dashboard. For more information, see Node health issues.</description></item><item><title>Rollback: Prevent accidental upgrades with cluster insights</title><link>https://kubermates.org/releases/2025-03-28-rollback-prevent-accidental-upgrades-with-cluster-insights/</link><pubDate>Fri, 28 Mar 2025 19:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/releases/2025-03-28-rollback-prevent-accidental-upgrades-with-cluster-insights/</guid><description>Help improve this page To contribute to this user guide, choose the Edit this page on GitHub link that is located in the right pane of every page. When a new Kubernetes version is available in Amazon EKS, you can update your Amazon EKS cluster to the latest version. Once you upgrade a cluster, you canât downgrade to a previous version. Before you update to a new Kubernetes version, we recommend that you review the information in Understand the Kubernetes version lifecycle on EKS and the update steps in this topic. New Kubernetes versions sometimes introduce significant changes. Therefore, we recommend that you test the behavior of your applications against a new Kubernetes version before you update your production clusters. You can do this by building a continuous integration workflow to test your application behavior before moving to a new Kubernetes version. The update process consists of Amazon EKS launching new API server nodes with the updated Kubernetes version to replace the existing ones. Amazon EKS performs standard infrastructure and readiness health checks for network traffic on these new nodes to verify that theyâre working as expected. However, once youâve started the cluster upgrade, you canât pause or stop it. If any of these checks fail, Amazon EKS reverts the infrastructure deployment, and your cluster remains on the prior Kubernetes version. Running applications arenât affected, and your cluster is never left in a non-deterministic or unrecoverable state.</description></item><item><title>Bottlerocket FIPS AMIs</title><link>https://kubermates.org/releases/2025-03-27-bottlerocket-fips-amis/</link><pubDate>Thu, 27 Mar 2025 19:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/releases/2025-03-27-bottlerocket-fips-amis/</guid><description>Help improve this page To contribute to this user guide, choose the Edit this page on GitHub link that is located in the right pane of every page. The Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) Publication 140-3 is a United States and Canadian government standard that specifies the security requirements for cryptographic modules that protect sensitive information. Bottlerocket makes it easier to adhere to FIPS by offering AMIs with a FIPS kernel. These AMIs are preconfigured to use FIPS 140-3 validated cryptographic modules. This includes the Amazon Linux 2023 Kernel Crypto API Cryptographic Module and the AWS-LC Cryptographic Module. Using Bottlerocket FIPS AMIs makes your worker nodes &amp;ldquo;FIPS ready&amp;rdquo; but not automatically &amp;ldquo;FIPS-compliant&amp;rdquo;. For more information, see Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) 140-3. If your cluster uses isolated subnets, the Amazon ECR FIPS endpoint may not be accessible. This can cause the node bootstrap to fail. Make sure that your network configuration allows access to the necessary FIPS endpoints. For more information, see Access a resource through a resource VPC endpoint in the AWS PrivateLink Guide. If your cluster uses a subnet with PrivateLink , image pulls will fail because Amazon ECR FIPS endpoints are not available through PrivateLink.</description></item><item><title>Update strategies for managed node groups</title><link>https://kubermates.org/releases/2025-01-27-update-strategies-for-managed-node-groups/</link><pubDate>Mon, 27 Jan 2025 19:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/releases/2025-01-27-update-strategies-for-managed-node-groups/</guid><description>Help improve this page To contribute to this user guide, choose the Edit this page on GitHub link that is located in the right pane of every page. The Amazon EKS managed worker node upgrade strategy has four different phases described in the following sections. The setup phase has these steps: It creates a new Amazon EC2 launch template version for the Auto Scaling Group thatâs associated with your node group. The new launch template version uses the target AMI or a custom launch template version for the update. It updates the Auto Scaling Group to use the latest launch template version. It determines the maximum quantity of nodes to upgrade in parallel using the updateConfig property for the node group. The maximum unavailable has a quota of 100 nodes. The default value is one node. For more information, see the updateConfig property in the Amazon EKS API Reference. When upgrading the nodes in a managed node group, the upgraded nodes are launched in the same Availability Zone as those that are being upgraded. To guarantee this placement, we use Amazon EC2âs Availability Zone Rebalancing. For more information, see Availability Zone Rebalancing in the Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling User Guide.</description></item><item><title>Kubernetes version 1.32</title><link>https://kubermates.org/releases/2025-01-23-kubernetes-version-1-32/</link><pubDate>Thu, 23 Jan 2025 19:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/releases/2025-01-23-kubernetes-version-1-32/</guid><description>Help improve this page To contribute to this user guide, choose the Edit this page on GitHub link that is located in the right pane of every page. Kubernetes rapidly evolves with new features, design updates, and bug fixes. The community releases new Kubernetes minor versions (such as 1. 33 ) on average once every four months. Amazon EKS follows the upstream release and deprecation cycle for minor versions. As new Kubernetes versions become available in Amazon EKS, we recommend that you proactively update your clusters to use the latest available version. A minor version is under standard support in Amazon EKS for the first 14 months after itâs released. Once a version is past the end of standard support date, it enters extended support for the next 12 months. Extended support allows you to stay at a specific Kubernetes version for longer at an additional cost per cluster hour. If you havenât updated your cluster before the extended support period ends, your cluster is auto-upgraded to the oldest currently supported extended version. Extended support is enabled by default. To disable, see Disable EKS extended support.</description></item><item><title>Amazon EKS Auto Mode</title><link>https://kubermates.org/releases/2024-12-01-amazon-eks-auto-mode/</link><pubDate>Sun, 01 Dec 2024 19:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/releases/2024-12-01-amazon-eks-auto-mode/</guid><description>Help improve this page To contribute to this user guide, choose the Edit this page on GitHub link that is located in the right pane of every page. EKS Auto Mode extends AWS management of Kubernetes clusters beyond the cluster itself, to allow AWS to also set up and manage the infrastructure that enables the smooth operation of your workloads. You can delegate key infrastructure decisions and leverage the expertise of AWS for day-to-day operations. Cluster infrastructure managed by AWS includes many Kubernetes capabilities as core components, as opposed to add-ons, such as compute autoscaling, pod and service networking, application load balancing, cluster DNS, block storage, and GPU support. To get started, you can deploy a new EKS Auto Mode cluster or enable EKS Auto Mode on an existing cluster. You can deploy, upgrade, or modify your EKS Auto Mode clusters using eksctl, the AWS CLI, the AWS Management Console, EKS APIs, or your preferred infrastructure-as-code tools. With EKS Auto Mode, you can continue using your preferred Kubernetes-compatible tools. EKS Auto Mode integrates with AWS services like Amazon EC2, Amazon EBS, and ELB, leveraging AWS cloud resources that follow best practices. These resources are automatically scaled, cost-optimized, and regularly updated to help minimize operational costs and overhead. EKS Auto Mode provides the following high-level features: Streamline Kubernetes Cluster Management : EKS Auto Mode streamlines EKS management by providing production-ready clusters with minimal operational overhead.
