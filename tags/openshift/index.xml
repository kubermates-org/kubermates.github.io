While students seek skills that inspire innovation and leadership, it&amp;rsquo;s the educator who specializes in making the transformation possible. A great educator acts as a dedicated mentor, and doesn&amp;rsquo;t just teach theoretical concepts but actively unlocks potential in the next generation. The path to IT leadership is rarely linear, especially when traditional academic curriculum struggles to maintain pace with rapidly evolving industry practices. A significant gap often exists between classroom knowledge and practical skills employers demand, meaning many graduates lack exposure to the enterprise-grade tools used by real companies. Employers have made their priority clear: They need practical, certified skills over purely theoretical knowledge. Red Hat Academy is a no-cost academic partnership program that Red Hat offers educational institutions (like universities and colleges) and turns them into authorized centers for delivering Red Hat&amp;rsquo;s enterprise-ready curriculum for students, focusing on the latest enterprise open-source technologies, including Red Hat Enterprise Linux administration, artificial intelligence, cloud computing, automation, and application development. Educators can easily integrate these industry-ready courses as part of their official or supplemental curriculum plan so students can gain access to the same open-source technologies utilized by major corporations worldwide. The content is delivered through a dedicated, web-based platform where instructors create and manage virtual classes and enroll students to access materials, free cloud labs for hands-on activities. Students also receive digital Credly badges and industry-recognized certificates when they complete a course or certification, respectively. Bridging the skill gap between industry and academia requires strong partnerships that enable instructors to bring industry standards directly into the classroom. This is where educators can leverage Red Hat Academy to transform their teaching environment.</description></item><item><title>4.21.0-okd-scos.ec.9</title><link>https://kubermates.org/releases/2025-11-24-4-21-0-okd-scos-ec-9/</link><pubDate>Mon, 24 Nov 2025 05:13:56 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/releases/2025-11-24-4-21-0-okd-scos-ec-9/</guid><description>Client tools for OKD/SCOS These archives contain the client tooling for OKD on CentOS Stream CoreOS.

Efficient infrastructure deployment is particularly difficult in areas with real-time demand fluctuations, such as stadiums and tourist spots. One key challenge lies in comprehending usage patterns and connectivity performance from the end-user&amp;rsquo;s perspective. A new paradigm is emerging: Customer and AI-driven network investments. This paradigm is being realized as a TM Forum catalyst project to build an AI-driven platform for network investments. Imagine every customer&amp;rsquo;s device acting as a real-time sensor for a service provider’s network. This is the promise of decentralized physical infrastructure networks (DePIN), an approach that puts customer experience at the center of every network decision. Red Hat, along with other industry leaders, are collaborating on this TM Forum catalyst project to develop a solution that combines the power of crowdsourced data with advanced analytics and artificial intelligence (AI) to deliver actionable insights. TM Forum is a global industry association that helps its members digitally transform through collaboration, innovation, and the development of standards and best practices. They provide resources like the open digital architecture , open APIs, and catalyst innovation programs to help members reduce costs, accelerate time-to-market, and deliver new services. The platform is built on three core pillars: User insights: With user consent, a lightweight application on customer devices collects quality-of-experience (QoE) and radio metrics to create a high-resolution, low-cost view of network performance. Following the DePIN approach, users are rewarded with on-chain tokens to create a transparent and verifiable incentive system.</description></item><item><title>Unifying multivendor DPUs in Red Hat OpenShift</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-11-24-unifying-multivendor-dpus-in-red-hat-openshift/</link><pubDate>Mon, 24 Nov 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-11-24-unifying-multivendor-dpus-in-red-hat-openshift/</guid><description>Unifying multivendor DPUs in Red Hat OpenShift A unified management platform for diverse hardware Standardized discovery through abstraction Deploying workloads with Kubernetes-native primitives Enabling true workload portability and interoperability What this means for Red Hat customers Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform | Product Trial About the author Balazs Nemeth More like this File encryption and decryption made easy with GPG Red Hat OpenShift Service on AWS supports Capacity Reservations and Capacity Blocks for Machine Learning Technically Speaking | Platform engineering for AI agents Technically Speaking | Driving healthcare discoveries with AI Keep exploring Browse by channel Automation Artificial intelligence Open hybrid cloud Security Edge computing Infrastructure Applications Virtualization Share Data Processing Units (DPUs) represent a significant evolution in datacenter architecture. By offloading infrastructure tasks like networking, security, and storage from the main CPU, they promise to unlock new levels of cloud capabilities. Red Hat OpenShift 4.20 delivers a major breakthrough in solving the primary challenge of DPU adoption: vendor lock-in. This new capability provides unified, vendor-agnostic support for different DPUs, all within a single cluster. This is the result of our focused, standards-based strategy. We began this journey by introducing tech preview support for the first DPU (the Intel IPU) in Red Hat OpenShift 4.19. By building on the open standards of the Open Programmable Infrastructure (OPI) project, our work for the 4.20 release has expanded this to include 2 additional DPUs: the Senao SX904 (Intel NetSec Accelerator) and the Marvell Octeon 10. This directly addresses the industry&amp;rsquo;s largest DPU challenge: the fragmented landscape. Until now, organizations have been forced into isolated, vendor-specific environments, each with proprietary tools, drivers, and APIs. This approach eliminates that fragmentation. As we&amp;rsquo;ve discussed in cloud-native enablement of DPUs , our goal is to make DPUs a smoothly integrated and abstracted component of Red Hat OpenShift. Our integration work is centered on a standard Red Hat OpenShift cluster.</description></item><item><title>4.20.0-okd-scos.9</title><link>https://kubermates.org/releases/2025-11-17-4-20-0-okd-scos-9/</link><pubDate>Mon, 17 Nov 2025 05:42:23 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/releases/2025-11-17-4-20-0-okd-scos-9/</guid><description>Client tools for OKD/SCOS These archives contain the client tooling for OKD on CentOS Stream CoreOS.

Red Hat OpenShift clusters are seeing a surge of AI-accelerated workloads, from GPU-intensive training jobs to large batches of inference requests. At the same time, other tenants still need consistent throughput for their everyday CI/CD pipelines and data processing tasks. The result is a constant battle for resources, where some jobs wait too long, others consume more than their fair share, and administrators are left fighting bottlenecks. This is exactly the challenge that Kueue, a Kubernetes-native job queueing and scheduling framework, was built to solve. It introduces structured queues, priorities, and quota enforcement to bring fairness and predictability back into scheduling. With Red Hat Build of Kueue, these upstream innovations are packaged, hardened, and delivered into Red Hat OpenShift as a supported, enterprise-ready solution to enable clusters to run efficiently while giving every workload a fair chance. Once workloads are queued fairly, the next challenge is where they actually land. For distributed jobs, placement can matter as much as allocation: pods that constantly exchange data perform very differently depending on whether they&amp;rsquo;re co-located or scattered across zones. This is where topology-aware scheduling (TAS) comes in. Rather than treating the cluster as a flat pool of machines, TAS considers the physical and logical layout of the infrastructure (racks, blocks, zones) and makes scheduling decisions that optimize communication and efficiency. Workloads that talk a lot can be placed closer together, multi-pod jobs can start in sync through gang scheduling, and fairness across tenants is preserved even as locality is optimized.</description></item><item><title>Introducing OpenShift Service Mesh 3.2 with Istio’s ambient mode</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-11-17-introducing-openshift-service-mesh-3-2-with-istio-s-ambient-mode/</link><pubDate>Mon, 17 Nov 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-11-17-introducing-openshift-service-mesh-3-2-with-istio-s-ambient-mode/</guid><description>Introducing OpenShift Service Mesh 3.2 with Istio’s ambient mode Upgrading to OpenShift Service Mesh 3.2 Sidecar-less service mesh: Istio’s ambient mode Ztunnel proxy Waypoint proxy Is Istio’s ambient mode right for you?

This release includes the general availability of Istio’s ambient mode —a new way of deploying service mesh without sidecars that significantly lowers the resource costs of using service mesh. This provides a low overhead solution for zero trust networking with lightweight pod-to-pod mTLS encryption and authorization policies based on workload identities, with the ability to add more advanced features as required. Based on the Istio, Envoy, and Kiali projects, this release updates the version of Istio to 1.27 and Kiali to 2.17 , and is supported on Red Hat OpenShift 4.18 and above. If you are running OpenShift Service Mesh 2.6 or earlier releases, you must upgrade to OpenShift Service Mesh 3.0, 3.1, and then 3.2. We recommend migrating to OpenShift Service Mesh 3.0 promptly, because version 2.6 reaches its end of life (EOL) on June 30, 2026 (recently extended from March 12, 2026). An in-depth migration guide is provided in the OpenShift Service Mesh 3.0 documentation , including an analysis of the differences between OpenShift Service Mesh 2.6 and 3.0. This blog post describes using the Kiali console for migrating between OpenShift Service Mesh 2.6 and 3.0. For an example of OpenShift Service Mesh 3 in action, with fully configured metrics and the Kiali console, see this solution pattern. This release brings generally available support for Istio’s ambient mode to OpenShift Service Mesh. Istio’s ambient mode is a significant new feature that enables service mesh features on workloads without the need for sidecar proxies. With Istio’s traditional dataplane architecture, known as “sidecar mode,” each application pod requires a sidecar proxy container to enable service mesh features.</description></item><item><title>DxOperator from DH2i is now certified for Red Hat OpenShift 4.19</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-11-14-dxoperator-from-dh2i-is-now-certified-for-red-hat-openshift-4-19/</link><pubDate>Fri, 14 Nov 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-11-14-dxoperator-from-dh2i-is-now-certified-for-red-hat-openshift-4-19/</guid><description>DxOperator from DH2i is now certified for Red Hat OpenShift 4.19 Simplifying Kubernetes SQL Server deployment Key features Why certification matters Enterprise-ready capabilities for OpenShift Empowering the modern enterprise Resources Red Hat Ansible Automation Platform | Product Trial About the authors Vivien Wang OJ Ngo More like this NGINX Gateway Fabric certified for Red Hat OpenShift Efficient Scheduling in Red Hat OpenShift with Kueue Press Start | Command Line Heroes Who’s Afraid Of Compilers? | Compiler Keep exploring Browse by channel Automation Artificial intelligence Open hybrid cloud Security Edge computing Infrastructure Applications Virtualization Share Kubernetes has emerged as a powerful foundation for deploying and managing cloud-native applications, and Red Hat OpenShift operators are the best way to streamline this.

Networking and Scaling Automation 2. Monitoring 3. User Validation Tooling That Supports Infrastructure Agility Where Can OpenShift Take Your Infrastructure? Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform | Product Trial About the author Derrick Sutherland More like this Blog post Blog post Blog post Keep exploring Browse by channel Automation Artificial intelligence Open hybrid cloud Security Edge computing Infrastructure Applications Virtualization Share The biggest challenge for disaster recovery in traditional environments is that every environment looks and feels different. If you&amp;rsquo;re moving from a colo that someone manages to VMware, the cloud, or a different VMware data center, they all look and feel different. Even if you&amp;rsquo;re using the same virtualization provider, storage is probably handled differently. There has to be a lot of planning and strategy around how to copy data from one area to another since that’s not something natively built into your virtualization provider. You also have to figure out networking, DNS, routing, etc. With Red Hat OpenShift , all of these components are software-defined. You get software-defined DNS, networking, and storage layers all because it’s based on Kubernetes. Out-of-the-box OpenShift won’t “automagically” failover without additional levels of configuration, much like VMware or other traditional infrastructure environments. But the tools required are mostly there for you, either pre-packaged and open-source or robustly tested and a standard in the space.</description></item><item><title>4.20.0-okd-scos.ec.12</title><link>https://kubermates.org/releases/2025-08-11-4-20-0-okd-scos-ec-12/</link><pubDate>Mon, 11 Aug 2025 02:51:53 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/releases/2025-08-11-4-20-0-okd-scos-ec-12/</guid><description>Client tools for OKD/SCOS These archives contain the client tooling for OKD on CentOS Stream CoreOS.

Red Hat OpenShift is recognized for its ability to execute and completeness of vision. Red Hat’s investments in OpenShift as a platform for AI workloads, and in building AI capabilities directly into the product to make users’ jobs easier. We believe it is also reflected in Red Hat’s position in the Gartner Magic Quadrant. OpenShift provides a comprehensive application platform with container management capabilities, including support for virtual machine workloads and AI-powered services. Magic Quadrant reports are a culmination of rigorous, fact-based research in specific markets, providing a wide-angle view of the relative positions of the providers in markets where growth is high and provider differentiation is distinct. Providers are positioned into four quadrants: Leaders, Challengers, Visionaries and Niche Players. Leaders execute well against their current vision and are well positioned for tomorrow. The research enables you to get the most from market analysis in alignment with your unique business and technology needs. Gartner defines container management as offerings that support the deployment and operation of containerized workloads and associated resources. It uses a combination of technologies (many open source) that enable agile application deployments and infrastructure modernization.</description></item><item><title>4.20.0-okd-scos.ec.11</title><link>https://kubermates.org/releases/2025-08-10-4-20-0-okd-scos-ec-11/</link><pubDate>Sun, 10 Aug 2025 03:42:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/releases/2025-08-10-4-20-0-okd-scos-ec-11/</guid><description>Client tools for OKD/SCOS These archives contain the client tooling for OKD on CentOS Stream CoreOS.

Learn more about Red Hat OpenShift as a Cloud-Native Application Platform Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform | Product Trial About the authors Alexa Overbay Anes Kim More like this Blog post Blog post Blog post Keep exploring Browse by channel Automation Artificial intelligence Open hybrid cloud Security Edge computing Infrastructure Applications Virtualization Share This week we announced that Red Hat has been positioned as a Leader for the second year in a row in the 2025 Gartner® Magic Quadrant™ for Cloud-Native Application Platforms. We are proud of this recognition, as we believe this is a strong validation of Red Hat OpenShift cloud services as a flexible, complete, and secure cloud-native application platform for AI-enabled applications and virtualized and containerized workloads across the hybrid cloud. The Red Hat OpenShift cloud services portfolio consists of jointly engineered solutions with hyperscalers, including Red Hat OpenShift Service on AWS , Azure Red Hat OpenShift , Red Hat OpenShift on IBM Cloud and Red Hat OpenShift Dedicated on Google Cloud. Source: Gartner, “Magic Quadrant for Cloud-Native Application Platforms,” August 2025 To help further explain the evaluation of the Gartner Magic Quadrant from our point of view, we’re answering some of the most frequently asked questions. “Magic Quadrant reports are a culmination of rigorous, fact-based research in specific markets, providing a wide-angle view of the relative positions of the providers in markets where growth is high and provider differentiation is distinct. Providers are positioned into four quadrants: Leaders, Challengers, Visionaries and Niche Players. The research enables you to get the most from market analysis in alignment with your unique business and technology needs. ” “Gartner defines cloud-native application platforms as those that provide managed application runtime environments for applications and integrated capabilities to manage the life cycle of an application or application component. They typically enable distributed application deployments and support cloud style operations — such as elasticity, multitenancy and self-service — without requiring the development team to provision infrastructure or manage containers. Cloud-native application platforms are designed to facilitate the deployment, runtime execution, and management of modern cloud-native or cloud-optimized applications without the need to manage any underlying infrastructure. Also, they are designed to enhance developer productivity, accelerate development and deployment cycles, and increase operational effectiveness by making it easier to scale on demand. Cloud-native application platforms offer a structured execution environment for applications, effectively hiding the complexities of the underlying infrastructure and computing resources.</description></item><item><title>Top 10 articles Red Hat customers are reading right now</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-08-07-top-10-articles-red-hat-customers-are-reading-right-now/</link><pubDate>Thu, 07 Aug 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-08-07-top-10-articles-red-hat-customers-are-reading-right-now/</guid><description>Top 10 articles Red Hat customers are reading right now 1.

Based on the Istio, Envoy, and Kiali projects, this release updates the version of Istio to 1.26 and Kiali to 2.11 , and is supported on OpenShift Container Platform 4.16 and above. This is the first minor release following Red Hat OpenShift Service Mesh 3.0, a major update to converge OpenShift Service Mesh with the community Istio project, with installation and management using the Sail operator. This change helps ensure that OpenShift Service Mesh can offer the latest stable Istio features with Red Hat support. If you are running OpenShift Service Mesh 2.6 or earlier releases, you must upgrade to OpenShift Service Mesh 3.0 before upgrading to 3.1. We recommend migrating to OpenShift Service Mesh 3.0 promptly, because version 2.6 reaches its end of life on March 12, 2026. An in-depth migration guide is provided in the OpenShift Service Mesh 3.0 documentation , including an analysis of the differences between OpenShift Service Mesh 2.6 and 3.0. We&amp;rsquo;ve also recently published an article that describes how to use the Kiali console for migrating between OpenShift Service Mesh 2.6 and 3.0. For an example of OpenShift Service Mesh 3.0 in action, with fully configured metrics and the Kiali console, see this solution pattern. Kubernetes Gateway API is the next generation of Kubernetes Ingress, load balancer, and service mesh APIs. Istio plans to make it the default set of APIs for creating and managing traffic using a service mesh, and it is required for using Istio&amp;rsquo;s ambient mode. Note that there are no plans to remove the stable Istio APIs, such as VirtualService, DestinationRule, and others.</description></item><item><title>4.20.0-okd-scos.ec.10</title><link>https://kubermates.org/releases/2025-07-29-4-20-0-okd-scos-ec-10/</link><pubDate>Tue, 29 Jul 2025 21:00:36 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/releases/2025-07-29-4-20-0-okd-scos-ec-10/</guid><description>Client tools for OKD/SCOS These archives contain the client tooling for OKD on CentOS Stream CoreOS.
