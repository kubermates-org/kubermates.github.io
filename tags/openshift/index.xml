Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform | Product Trial About the author Derrick Sutherland More like this Blog post Blog post Blog post Keep exploring Browse by channel Automation Artificial intelligence Open hybrid cloud Security Edge computing Infrastructure Applications Virtualization Share The biggest challenge for disaster recovery in traditional environments is that every environment looks and feels different. If you&amp;rsquo;re moving from a colo that someone manages to VMware, the cloud, or a different VMware data center, they all look and feel different. Even if you&amp;rsquo;re using the same virtualization provider, storage is probably handled differently. There has to be a lot of planning and strategy around how to copy data from one area to another since that’s not something natively built into your virtualization provider. You also have to figure out networking, DNS, routing, etc. With Red Hat OpenShift , all of these components are software-defined. You get software-defined DNS, networking, and storage layers all because it’s based on Kubernetes. Out-of-the-box OpenShift won’t “automagically” failover without additional levels of configuration, much like VMware or other traditional infrastructure environments. But the tools required are mostly there for you, either pre-packaged and open-source or robustly tested and a standard in the space.</description></item><item><title>4.20.0-okd-scos.ec.12</title><link>https://kubermates.org/releases/2025-08-11-4-20-0-okd-scos-ec-12/</link><pubDate>Mon, 11 Aug 2025 02:51:53 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/releases/2025-08-11-4-20-0-okd-scos-ec-12/</guid><description>Client tools for OKD/SCOS These archives contain the client tooling for OKD on CentOS Stream CoreOS.

Learn more about Red Hat OpenShift for Container Management Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform | Product Trial About the authors Sara Buffington Debbie Margulies More like this Blog post Blog post Blog post Keep exploring Browse by channel Automation Artificial intelligence Open hybrid cloud Security Edge computing Infrastructure Applications Virtualization Share This week we announced that for the third consecutive year, Red Hat has been named a Leader in the Gartner® Magic Quadrant™ for Container Management. We’re thrilled by this recognition and believe it represents continued validation of Red Hat OpenShift’s strong execution and strategy for delivering an industry leading application platform across hybrid environments from the data center, to the cloud, and to the edge. Red Hat OpenShift is recognized for its ability to execute and completeness of vision. Red Hat’s investments in OpenShift as a platform for AI workloads, and in building AI capabilities directly into the product to make users’ jobs easier. We believe it is also reflected in Red Hat’s position in the Gartner Magic Quadrant. OpenShift provides a comprehensive application platform with container management capabilities, including support for virtual machine workloads and AI-powered services. Magic Quadrant reports are a culmination of rigorous, fact-based research in specific markets, providing a wide-angle view of the relative positions of the providers in markets where growth is high and provider differentiation is distinct. Providers are positioned into four quadrants: Leaders, Challengers, Visionaries and Niche Players. Leaders execute well against their current vision and are well positioned for tomorrow. The research enables you to get the most from market analysis in alignment with your unique business and technology needs. Gartner defines container management as offerings that support the deployment and operation of containerized workloads and associated resources. It uses a combination of technologies (many open source) that enable agile application deployments and infrastructure modernization.</description></item><item><title>4.20.0-okd-scos.ec.11</title><link>https://kubermates.org/releases/2025-08-10-4-20-0-okd-scos-ec-11/</link><pubDate>Sun, 10 Aug 2025 03:42:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/releases/2025-08-10-4-20-0-okd-scos-ec-11/</guid><description>Client tools for OKD/SCOS These archives contain the client tooling for OKD on CentOS Stream CoreOS.

We are proud of this recognition, as we believe this is a strong validation of Red Hat OpenShift cloud services as a flexible, complete, and secure cloud-native application platform for AI-enabled applications and virtualized and containerized workloads across the hybrid cloud. The Red Hat OpenShift cloud services portfolio consists of jointly engineered solutions with hyperscalers, including Red Hat OpenShift Service on AWS , Azure Red Hat OpenShift , Red Hat OpenShift on IBM Cloud and Red Hat OpenShift Dedicated on Google Cloud. Source: Gartner, “Magic Quadrant for Cloud-Native Application Platforms,” August 2025 To help further explain the evaluation of the Gartner Magic Quadrant from our point of view, we’re answering some of the most frequently asked questions. “Magic Quadrant reports are a culmination of rigorous, fact-based research in specific markets, providing a wide-angle view of the relative positions of the providers in markets where growth is high and provider differentiation is distinct. Providers are positioned into four quadrants: Leaders, Challengers, Visionaries and Niche Players. The research enables you to get the most from market analysis in alignment with your unique business and technology needs. ” “Gartner defines cloud-native application platforms as those that provide managed application runtime environments for applications and integrated capabilities to manage the life cycle of an application or application component. They typically enable distributed application deployments and support cloud style operations — such as elasticity, multitenancy and self-service — without requiring the development team to provision infrastructure or manage containers. Cloud-native application platforms are designed to facilitate the deployment, runtime execution, and management of modern cloud-native or cloud-optimized applications without the need to manage any underlying infrastructure. Also, they are designed to enhance developer productivity, accelerate development and deployment cycles, and increase operational effectiveness by making it easier to scale on demand. Cloud-native application platforms offer a structured execution environment for applications, effectively hiding the complexities of the underlying infrastructure and computing resources.</description></item><item><title>Top 10 articles Red Hat customers are reading right now</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-08-07-top-10-articles-red-hat-customers-are-reading-right-now/</link><pubDate>Thu, 07 Aug 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-08-07-top-10-articles-red-hat-customers-are-reading-right-now/</guid><description>Top 10 articles Red Hat customers are reading right now 1.
