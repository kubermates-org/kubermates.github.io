A significant challenge for telecommunication (telco) service providers is the management of different software versions of these network functions, especially in a multivendor environment. A particular version may include new features, bug fixes, or require specific configurations. Consequently, testing of the network functions is complex, going beyond the verification of each component&amp;rsquo;s functionality to ensure that various versions of these network functions can interoperate. Dealing with this complexity necessitates extensive testing automation to guarantee streamlined operations across the service provider’s network. Adopting a cloud-native design for the 5G core gives service providers a competitive edge in building networks that easily scale and adapt. A distributed and disaggregated 5G core network introduces additional challenges, particularly around ensuring that all the different components can work together. As 5G core cloud-native network functions (CNFs) are made up of microservices that are constantly being updated and deployed in a dynamic environment, keeping tabs on security and adherence to standards becomes an overwhelming task. To ensure that all independently developed components of the 5G core operate effectively, the various network functions within the 5G core must interoperate efficiently, adhering to 3GPP standards. Still, as each 5G core vendor implements their microservices slightly differently, rigorous testing of these interactions is crucial. To ensure robustness and performance, the 5G core needs to be tested at different levels: Red Hat and Rebaca have collaborated to produce an autonomous continuous testing framework to address the challenges outlined with 5G core lifecycle management. The framework is engineered to facilitate the consistent delivery of compliant and interoperable 5G core CNFs.</description></item><item><title>4.20.0-okd-scos.ec.13</title><link>https://kubermates.org/releases/2025-08-25-4-20-0-okd-scos-ec-13/</link><pubDate>Mon, 25 Aug 2025 07:54:47 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/releases/2025-08-25-4-20-0-okd-scos-ec-13/</guid><description>These archives contain the client tooling for OKD on CentOS Stream CoreOS.

Military organizations are increasingly operating across a hybrid infrastructure, spanning the strategic core, deployed edge, and tactical edge, while maintaining absolute control over their systems. However, this evolution presents significant challenges, from siloed technologies to cybersecurity threats. Defence organizations must navigate these obstacles by adopting a unified platform approach, leveraging an open framework based on open standards to strengthen autonomy, security, and seamless operations across all environments. Traditionally, defence operations began in the strategic core, which were large, on-premise data centers disconnected from the internet. These handled everything from mission planning to logistics. The first wave of transformation introduced private cloud solutions, allowing military organizations to scale infrastructure dynamically while maintaining digital sovereignty. Many defence entities remain cautious about using the public cloud due to security concerns, opting instead for air-gapped private clouds—physically isolated environments within their facilities—so only screened personnel and verified secure networks have access. Today, the focus has shifted to edge computing, highlighting the need for smarter, real-time, and autonomous decision-making in the field. Defence organizations now operate across two key edge environments, the deployed edge and the tactical edge. The deployed edge consists of mini data centres, capable of running mission-critical applications, processing intelligence and supporting AI workloads. Meanwhile, the tactical edge encompasses lightweight, ruggedized devices such as drones, autonomous vehicles, and soldier-worn systems that can collect, analyse, and act on data in real time, often completely disconnected from central networks.</description></item><item><title>Optimize your virtualization platform: IBM Turbonomic now manages VMs on Red Hat OpenShift</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-08-22-optimize-your-virtualization-platform-ibm-turbonomic-now-manages-vms-on-red-hat-/</link><pubDate>Fri, 22 Aug 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-08-22-optimize-your-virtualization-platform-ibm-turbonomic-now-manages-vms-on-red-hat-/</guid><description>Share With many businesses rethinking their reliance on their traditional virtualization platform, IT teams are looking for ways to manage costs without compromising performance or control.

Our efforts are driven by minimizing the increase in energy consumption of AI, cloud computing, and IT infrastructure. Red Hat focuses on open source technologies designed to improve energy efficiency across IT environments. This includes: InstructLab is an open source project that enhances large language models (LLMs) used in generative AI (gen AI), upgrading an LLM with less human input and fewer resources than retraining. One of the key aspects of InstructLab is its focus on smaller, fine-tuned language models. This approach directly translates to improved energy efficiency compared to larger, more resource-intensive LLMs deployed by competitors. Smaller language models require significantly less computational power for training and inference, leading to reduced energy consumption. InstructLab optimizes performance by tailoring SLMs to specific tasks or domains, enhancing efficiency, minimizing wasteful energy, and enabling models to run on lower-power CPUs as opposed to power-hungry GPUs. This lower energy consumption results in reduced operational costs, providing both financial benefits and support for sustainability goals. Red Hat&amp;rsquo;s energy-efficient solutions offer significant benefits for enterprises, from reducing operational costs to helping achieve ambitious sustainability targets. By optimizing resource utilization and enhancing performance, these solutions also provide a crucial competitive advantage in today&amp;rsquo;s market, which include: Red Hat and SoftBank have collaborate d on Artificial Intelligence Radio Access Network (AI-RAN) to optimize power consumption in datacenters powering AI applications and vRAN. This project integrates Kepler, an open source project founded at Red Hat, into SoftBank&amp;rsquo;s AI and Telecom Radio Access System (AITRAS) platform.</description></item><item><title>Disaster Recovery: Achieving Instantaneous Hot-Hot with OpenShift</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-08-20-disaster-recovery-achieving-instantaneous-hot-hot-with-openshift/</link><pubDate>Wed, 20 Aug 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-08-20-disaster-recovery-achieving-instantaneous-hot-hot-with-openshift/</guid><description>Share The biggest challenge for disaster recovery in traditional environments is that every environment looks and feels different. If you&amp;rsquo;re moving from a colo that someone manages to VMware, the cloud, or a different VMware data center, they all look and feel different. Even if you&amp;rsquo;re using the same virtualization provider, storage is probably handled differently. There has to be a lot of planning and strategy around how to copy data from one area to another since that’s not something natively built into your virtualization provider. You also have to figure out networking, DNS, routing, etc. With Red Hat OpenShift , all of these components are software-defined. You get software-defined DNS, networking, and storage layers all because it’s based on Kubernetes. Out-of-the-box OpenShift won’t “automagically” failover without additional levels of configuration, much like VMware or other traditional infrastructure environments. But the tools required are mostly there for you, either pre-packaged and open-source or robustly tested and a standard in the space. You can set up OpenShift in any environment because the least common denominator for everything, no matter where you are (bare metal or virtual), is the operating system This is where OpenShift lives. That’s why it is the perfect tool for building a truly agile infrastructure that can move freely between environments, providing instantaneous disaster recovery for businesses. There are different benefits of infrastructure agility.</description></item><item><title>4.20.0-okd-scos.ec.12</title><link>https://kubermates.org/releases/2025-08-11-4-20-0-okd-scos-ec-12/</link><pubDate>Mon, 11 Aug 2025 02:51:53 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/releases/2025-08-11-4-20-0-okd-scos-ec-12/</guid><description>These archives contain the client tooling for OKD on CentOS Stream CoreOS.
