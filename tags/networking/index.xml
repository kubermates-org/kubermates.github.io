&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;eBPF&lt;/strong&gt; (Extended Berkeley Packet Filter) is like magic for the Linux kernel! 🪄 It lets developers run custom code directly within the kernel, safely and efficiently, without needing to modify the kernel&amp;rsquo;s source code or load new modules. Originally, eBPF was created to help with network packet filtering, but it has evolved into a Swiss Army knife 🛠️ for all sorts of tasks, from observability to security and system performance monitoring.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>A Guide to Modern Kubernetes Service Networking 🚀</title><link>https://kubermates.org/blog/a-guide-to-modern-kubernetes-service-networking-4017/</link><pubDate>Mon, 26 Aug 2024 19:32:17 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/blog/a-guide-to-modern-kubernetes-service-networking-4017/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;As Kubernetes becomes the go-to platform for managing cloud-native applications, how we handle network traffic has evolved. If you’re already using Kubernetes, you might have heard about service meshes like Istio and Linkerd, which have been popular choices for managing service-to-service communication. But now, there’s a new player in town—the Kubernetes Gateway API! Let’s dive into what the Gateway API is, how it compares to Istio and Linkerd, and when you might want to use each. 🌟&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>A quick navigation through Service Mesh in Kubernetes 👀</title><link>https://kubermates.org/blog/a-quick-navigation-through-service-mesh-in-kubernetes-5dea/</link><pubDate>Tue, 20 Aug 2024 10:52:45 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/blog/a-quick-navigation-through-service-mesh-in-kubernetes-5dea/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;re working with Kubernetes, you know that managing communication between microservices can get complicated as your application grows. Enter &lt;strong&gt;Linkerd&lt;/strong&gt;, a powerful yet user-friendly service mesh that simplifies this process by handling traffic management, security, and observability for your microservices. In this article, we&amp;rsquo;ll walk you through what Linkerd is, how to set it up, and how to use it to manage your services, including examples of Blue-Green and Canary deployments. We’ll also compare Linkerd with Istio, another popular service mesh, and provide references to official documentation to help you along the way.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>🌐 Kubernetes DNS: How to Use In-Cluster and Azure Private DNS Together</title><link>https://kubermates.org/blog/kubernetes-dns-how-to-use-in-cluster-and-azure-private-dns-together-48h3/</link><pubDate>Sat, 17 Aug 2024 17:51:44 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/blog/kubernetes-dns-how-to-use-in-cluster-and-azure-private-dns-together-48h3/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Kubernetes is a powerful platform for managing containerized applications, providing robust tools for networking, service discovery, and DNS resolution. This guide will explore how Kubernetes handles DNS resolution within the cluster and how you can integrate it with Azure Private DNS to securely resolve external, private resources.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="-understanding-kubernetes-services-and-dns-resolution"&gt;🔍 Understanding Kubernetes Services and DNS Resolution&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kubernetes Services provide a stable network identity for a set of Pods, allowing other components to communicate with them reliably. This is crucial since Pods in Kubernetes are ephemeral and their IP addresses can change over time.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
