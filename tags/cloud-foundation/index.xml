The conversation focused on five priorities: security and resilience, scalability, operational simplicity, developer enablement, and innovation. Forrester’s Ellis emphasized that organizations are seeking standardization in platform engineering, with platforms treating VMs and Kubernetes workloads equally. This is a core design principle of VMware Cloud Foundation 9.0. This discussion laid the groundwork for why platform choices matter, especially for private clouds. Let’s now dive deeper into five key principles for successfully designing and operating modern applications, using best practices from NIST, CNCF, Google SRE, and ITIL. Modern applications are no longer confined to virtual machines, containers, or cloud accounts.</description></item><item><title>VCF Breakroom Chats Episode 77: Orchestrate like a Pro – Event Subscriptions and Extensibility for Every Admin with VCF 9.0</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-12-19-vcf-breakroom-chats-episode-77-orchestrate-like-a-pro-event-subscriptions-and-ex/</link><pubDate>Fri, 19 Dec 2025 16:08:40 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-12-19-vcf-breakroom-chats-episode-77-orchestrate-like-a-pro-event-subscriptions-and-ex/</guid><description>About the VCF Breakroom Chat Series Discover more from VMware Cloud Foundation (VCF) Blog Related Articles 5 Key Principles of Modern Applications VCF Breakroom Chats Episode 77: Orchestrate like a Pro – Event Subscriptions and Extensibility for Every Admin with VCF 9.0 VCF Breakroom Chats Episode 76: Cloud Admin Fast Track – Learn Infrastructure as Code the Easy Way with VCF 9.0 In this episode of VCF Breakroom Chats , Alina Thylander and Scott McDermott break down how VMware Cloud Foundation (VCF) 9.0 makes private cloud automation smarter and easier with event‑driven extensibility.

While the upgrade from VCF 5. x is designed to be streamlined, it introduces mandatory changes in management methodologies and requires careful, phased execution. I recently presented a packed webinar with Brent Douglas, diving deep into the VCF 5.2 to VCF 9.0 upgrade process. With hundreds of attendees and a flood of questions, it’s clear this transition is top-of-mind for many of you. I’ve sifted through the noise, merging similar inquiries into single, comprehensive challenges. Below are the Top 10 “must-know” questions submitted by the audience, complete with the detailed answers you need to navigate your VCF 9.0 journey with confidence. There were several questions around SDDC Manager and upgrades. There are no major changes to the way upgrades are performed. If you are familiar with VCF 5.2 the asynchronous patching functionality is built into the console in the same way in the 9.0 release. This lets you schedule upgrades/patches as needed. The big difference is that the SDDC Manager interface has been incorporated into the VCF Operations console located under the fleet management section.</description></item><item><title>VCF Breakroom Chats Episode 76: Cloud Admin Fast Track – Learn Infrastructure as Code the Easy Way with VCF 9.0</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-12-17-vcf-breakroom-chats-episode-76-cloud-admin-fast-track-learn-infrastructure-as-co/</link><pubDate>Wed, 17 Dec 2025 22:13:13 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-12-17-vcf-breakroom-chats-episode-76-cloud-admin-fast-track-learn-infrastructure-as-co/</guid><description>About the VCF Breakroom Chat Series Discover more from VMware Cloud Foundation (VCF) Blog Related Articles VCF Breakroom Chats Episode 76: Cloud Admin Fast Track – Learn Infrastructure as Code the Easy Way with VCF 9.0 VCF Breakroom Chats Episode 75 - Breaking the GitOps Barrier: Continuous Delivery for Modern Apps with VCF 9 VMware Cloud Foundation Automation – Consume and Deploy Virtual Machines and Kubernetes Clusters Ready to make Infrastructure as Code feel easy?

In fact, vSAN often comes up in conversations about Memory Tiering given its similarities, but also due to compatibility inquiries, so let’s dive in. When we first started working with Memory Tiering, the similarities between Memory Tiering and vSAN OSA were quite evident. Both have a multi-tier approach where active data is on fast devices and dormant data is on less expensive devices, thereby helping reduce TCO and the need for expensive devices for dormant data. They are also both deeply integrated into vSphere and are easy to implement. But aside from similarities, there was initially some confusion about compatibility, integration, and having both features enabled at the same time. So, let me answer those questions. Yes, you can have vSAN and Memory Tiering enabled on the same clusters at the same time. The confusion that exists is more around vSAN providing storage to Memory Tiering which is definitely not supported. I’ve covered this before, but I want to reiterate that although both solutions may be using NVMe devices, it does not mean they can share resources. Memory Tiering requires its own physical or logical device strictly for memory allocation. We do not want to share this physical/logical device with anything else including vSAN or other datastores.</description></item><item><title>Using Harbor as a Proxy Cache for Cloud-Based Registries</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-12-16-using-harbor-as-a-proxy-cache-for-cloud-based-registries/</link><pubDate>Tue, 16 Dec 2025 11:26:21 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-12-16-using-harbor-as-a-proxy-cache-for-cloud-based-registries/</guid><description>The Problem: Public Registry Challenges Why Use a Proxy Cache?

But what happens when your team scales? What starts as a simple docker pull nginx command can quickly become a bottleneck. docker pull nginx Picture this scenario: Your organization has 50 developers, each running builds multiple times a day. Your CI/CD system spins up fresh containers for every pipeline run. Each environment such as development, staging, and production pulls the same base images repeatedly. All of these pulls hit the public registry directly. Soon, you start experiencing: Rate Limiting Issues: Some public registries limit anonymous users to a specific number pulls per hour. With multiple teams and automated systems, you’ll hit these limits quickly, causing builds to fail with cryptic “too many requests” errors. Slow Build Times: Every pull traverses the internet, adding latency. A 500MB image that could be retrieved from your local network in seconds takes minutes from a public registry. Network Costs: Cloud providers charge for egress traffic. Repeatedly pulling multi-gigabyte images from external registries can result in significant monthly bills.</description></item><item><title>The New Paradigm: MLPerf Inference 5.1 Confirms VCF is the Future of AI/ML Performance</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-12-15-the-new-paradigm-mlperf-inference-5-1-confirms-vcf-is-the-future-of-ai-ml-perfor/</link><pubDate>Mon, 15 Dec 2025 20:23:02 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-12-15-the-new-paradigm-mlperf-inference-5-1-confirms-vcf-is-the-future-of-ai-ml-perfor/</guid><description>MLPerf Inference 5.1 Performance with VCF on SuperMicro server with NVIDIA 8xB200 MLPerf Inference 5.1 Performance with VCF on Dell server with NVIDIA 8xH200 MLPerf Inference 5.1 Performance in VCF with Intel Xeon 6 Processor Conclusion Discover more from VMware Cloud Foundation (VCF) Blog Related Articles Deploy VCF Private AI Services in Minimal VMware Cloud Foundation Environments Using Harbor as a Proxy Cache for Cloud-Based Registries The New Paradigm: MLPerf Inference 5.1 Confirms VCF is the Future of AI/ML Performance Broadcom collaborated with Dell, Intel, NVIDIA, and SuperMicro to highlight the advantages of virtualization, delivering standout MLPerf Inference v5.1 results.

Almost any network switch will work with vSAN, but that does not mean they all meet your data center requirements. There are characteristics of modern network switches that you should consider when moving forward with your latest hardware refresh, or new cluster build. Let’s look at what warrants attention, and why these specifications are so important. vSAN is a distributed storage solution. It stores data across hosts in a cluster to ensure data resilience and availability. The hosts that make up a vSAN cluster depend on fast, reliable networking to provide consistent, low latency storage. Figure 1. vSAN’s distributed storage model and its reliance on networking. The dramatic increase in hardware capabilities found in servers over the past two decades is stunning. CPU cores have increased anywhere between 32-128 times of what they were 20 years ago.

Factory floors, energy grids, and logistics hubs are brimming with opportunities for improvement, and the people who know these processes best are your OT experts: the factory workers, engineers, and floor supervisors. They have the knowledge and motivation to optimize their daily operations. The problem? Traditional, complex IT infrastructure has been a towering obstacle to getting their ideas off the ground. For years, operational staff have sought ways to digitize and improve their workflows, often turning to low-code development tools like Node-RED to quickly build applications. These tools are fantastic for rapid prototyping and connecting industrial systems, but they still run into challenges when it comes to deployment, security, and enterprise scale. The primary obstacles for these citizen developers include the following. Complexity of Deployment: Setting up robust, secure, and scalable environments (like Kubernetes clusters or virtual machines) is a full-time IT job, not an OT one. Lack of Unified Support: OT and IT platforms often live in silos, leading to fragmented security, inconsistent management, and painful handoffs. Security and Robustness: A quickly deployed application must run on a secure, reliable foundation that meets industrial uptime and regulatory standards. This is where VMware Cloud Foundation (VCF) Edge completely changes the game. VCF Edge is designed to bring the robustness and management simplicity of the core data center right to your remote or edge sites—whether that’s a factory floor, a retail branch, or a substation.</description></item><item><title>Erasure Codes in VMware vSAN versus Storage Arrays</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-12-10-erasure-codes-in-vmware-vsan-versus-storage-arrays/</link><pubDate>Wed, 10 Dec 2025 13:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-12-10-erasure-codes-in-vmware-vsan-versus-storage-arrays/</guid><description>The Purpose of Erasure Coding Data Storage in vSAN versus a Storage Array Comparing Erasure Codes in vSAN versus Traditional Storage Storage Array vSAN Decoupling Cluster Size and Availability Summary Discover more from VMware Cloud Foundation (VCF) Blog Related Articles Erasure Codes in VMware vSAN versus Storage Arrays Integrating VMware Data Services Manager with Harbor for a Production-Ready Registry NVMe Memory Tiering Design and Sizing on VMware Cloud Foundation 9 Part 3: Sizing for Success Data availability is a core competency of enterprise storage systems. For decades, these systems have attempted to deliver high levels of data availability while ensuring that performance and space efficiency expectations are also met. Achieving all three at the same time is not easy. Erasure coding has played an important role in storing data in a resilient yet space-efficient way. This post will help you better understand how erasure coding is implemented in VMware vSAN, how it is different from what may be found in traditional storage arrays, and how best to interpret an erasure code’s capabilities with data availability. The primary responsibility of any storage system is to give back the bit of data that has been requested. To ensure it can do this reliably, storage systems must store that data in a resilient way. A simple form of data resilience would be through the use of multiple copies, or “mirrors” that would help maintain availability in the event of some type of discrete failure in the storage system, such as a disk in a storage array, or a host in a distributed storage system like vSAN. One of the challenges with this approach is storing full copies of data becomes very costly in terms of capacity consumption. An additional copy would double the amount of data stored, while two additional copies would triple the amount of data stored. Erasure codes are used to store data in a resilient way, but with much more space efficiency relative to traditional mirroring of data. It does not use the approach of copies.</description></item><item><title>Integrating VMware Data Services Manager with Harbor for a Production-Ready Registry</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-12-09-integrating-vmware-data-services-manager-with-harbor-for-a-production-ready-regi/</link><pubDate>Tue, 09 Dec 2025 07:37:13 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-12-09-integrating-vmware-data-services-manager-with-harbor-for-a-production-ready-regi/</guid><description>The Solution: Leveraging VMware Data Services Manager with Harbor Prerequisites Step 1: Provisioning PostgreSQL with VMware DSM Step 2: Preparing the Harbor Helm Chart Configuration Step 3: Deploying Harbor on Kubernetes Step 4: Verification and Maintenance Conclusion Discover more from VMware Cloud Foundation (VCF) Blog Related Articles VCF Breakroom Chats Episode 78: Build, Deploy, and Scale with vSphere Kubernetes Service 3.5 Unlocking Innovation on the Factory Floor: How VMware VCF Edge Empowers OT Citizen Developers Erasure Codes in VMware vSAN versus Storage Arrays Harbor is a widely adopted, open-source registry that secures artifacts with role-based access control, scans images for vulnerabilities, and ensures images are replicated and trusted. As a cloud-native registry, it is a critical component for any organization leveraging Kubernetes and containerization. In our previous blog , we established that while Harbor includes a built-in PostgreSQL database, this setup is generally not recommended for production use. Deploying a resilient, highly available container registry requires separating the application and database lifecycle to ensure operational excellence. Here are the key reasons why a dedicated, external database is critical for production Harbor deployments: Lack of High Availability (HA): The default internal PostgreSQL setup is typically a single instance, creating a single point of failure. A database pod failure means your entire Harbor instance becomes unavailable. Limited Scalability: An embedded database is not designed for independent scaling. Database performance bottlenecks that arise from growth can be difficult to address without disrupting Harbor itself. Complex Lifecycle Management: Managing critical database operations such as backups, point-in-time recovery, patching, and upgrades directly within an application’s Helm chart is significantly more complex and error-prone than with dedicated database solutions. To address these challenges, we need a highly available PostgreSQL cluster. This is where VMware Data Services Manager (DSM) comes in. VMware Cloud Foundation (VCF) is the private cloud platform that delivers on-premises security, resilience, and performance, providing the underlying infrastructure for modern private cloud environments, including the Kubernetes clusters where applications like Harbor are deployed.</description></item><item><title>Private Cloud Operations Made Easy</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-12-08-private-cloud-operations-made-easy/</link><pubDate>Mon, 08 Dec 2025 15:23:44 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-12-08-private-cloud-operations-made-easy/</guid><description>Discover more from VMware Cloud Foundation (VCF) Blog Related Articles Private Cloud Operations Made Easy VCF Breakroom Chats Episode 75 - Breaking the GitOps Barrier: Continuous Delivery for Modern Apps with VCF 9 VMware Cloud Foundation Automation – Consume and Deploy Virtual Machines and Kubernetes Clusters Introducing Our Latest eBook: Private Cloud Operations for Dummies Are you looking to simplify IT infrastructure operations, reduce management complexity, and gain the flexibility to address your digital business objectives?

Over the past few months, we’ve released several updates to make VMware Cloud on AWS (VMC) more flexible and easier to use. It’s easy to miss the latest updates on our release notes , so we want to use this opportunity to highlight some of the most recent feature releases. Our latest features provide enterprise customers more cost-efficient resilience with non-stretched secondary clusters and improved scale-down, clearer operational insights via a redesigned user interface, an improved VMC Sizer, and new Host Usage APIs, and continued product enhancements through HCX 4.11.3. Here’s a look at what’s new. When you deploy a Software Defined Datacenter (SDDC) in VMC, you are given the choice of either a standard or a stretched SDDC deployment. While a standard cluster is deployed in a single AWS availability zone (AZ), a stretched cluster offers improved availability by deploying the SDDC across three AWS availability zones. Two of the availability zones are selected for the instance deployments and the third hosts the vSAN witness component. Because SDDCs in stretched clusters deploy hosts in two AWS availability zones, they require customers to size at two to one for their resource needs. This can be cost prohibitive for workloads that don’t require high availability. Additionally, once stretched clusters have been scaled beyond six hosts, they were previously unable to scale back down. To improve both of these experiences, the VMC team has introduced Non-Stretched Secondary Clusters in Stretched Cluster SDDCs and Improved Scale-Down Options for Stretched Clusters.</description></item><item><title>What’s Next for Cloud Native: Highlights from KubeCon North America 2025</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-12-02-what-s-next-for-cloud-native-highlights-from-kubecon-north-america-2025/</link><pubDate>Tue, 02 Dec 2025 14:37:54 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-12-02-what-s-next-for-cloud-native-highlights-from-kubecon-north-america-2025/</guid><description>Cloud Native and AI Continue to Advance Together VKS: Certified Kubernetes AI Conformant Supply Chain Security and Identity Are Top Priorities Platform Engineering Is Becoming a Repeatable Discipline AI Networking, Compute, and Storage Are Converging Sessions, Demos, and Industry Engagement Sessions Our Upstream Contributions: Strengthening Kubernetes for Everyone Sharing Practical Expertise: Demos and Technical Deep Dives Looking Ahead Discover more from VMware Cloud Foundation (VCF) Blog Related Articles VCF Breakroom Chats Episode 75 - Breaking the GitOps Barrier: Continuous Delivery for Modern Apps with VCF 9 What’s Next for Cloud Native: Highlights from KubeCon North America 2025 Making Harbor Production-Ready: Essential Considerations for Deployment KubeCon + CloudNativeCon North America once again brought together thousands of developers, maintainers, operators, and end users from across the cloud native ecosystem. More than 9,000 attendees gathered in Atlanta, with nearly half joining for the first time, reflecting the accelerating global adoption of Kubernetes and open source innovation. For Broadcom, KubeCon is where we connect directly with the community that has shaped Kubernetes from its earliest days. It’s where we learn, share, and collaborate on the technologies that define modern cloud infrastructure. Here are the major themes that stood out this year and how we are helping customers take advantage of what’s next. A clear message emerged among a number of the keynotes and technical sessions: The future of AI is cloud native, and the future of cloud native is AI. Whether it was Adobe’s “Maximum Acceleration” keynote, Niantic’s real-time ML workflows, or Cohere’s enterprise AI architecture, it became evident that Kubernetes has become the foundation for training, serving, and governing AI models. These were some of the main takeaways : Inference is still the dominant enterprise AI workload, projected to drive hundreds of billions in investment over the next decade AI workloads need portability and interoperability across data centers and public clouds DRA (Dynamic Resource Allocation) is now the standard Kubernetes API for orchestrating accelerators and other specialized resources including GPUs, networking interfaces, and fine-grained CPI sharing. This is now GA in Kubernetes v1.34 Multi-cluster and multi-cloud operations are becoming standard patterns For more than two decades, we have engineered the operational foundations now required for large-scale AI: predictable scheduling, isolation boundaries, memory and CPU efficiency, and robust lifecycle automation. These strengths directly support the direction Kubernetes is heading. Our upstream work, including etcd improvements, leadership on long-term lifecycle stability, conformance engagement, and contributions across SIGs ensures our platforms adopt these emerging AI-native standards in a way enterprises can trust. This year, the CNCF formally launched Kubernetes AI Conformance, validating the essential set of capabilities required for portable and interoperable AI workloads.</description></item><item><title>NVMe Memory Tiering Design and Sizing on VMware Cloud Foundation 9 Part 3: Sizing for Success</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-12-02-nvme-memory-tiering-design-and-sizing-on-vmware-cloud-foundation-9-part-3-sizing/</link><pubDate>Tue, 02 Dec 2025 12:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-12-02-nvme-memory-tiering-design-and-sizing-on-vmware-cloud-foundation-9-part-3-sizing/</guid><description>Discover more from VMware Cloud Foundation (VCF) Blog Related Articles NVMe Memory Tiering Design and Sizing on VMware Cloud Foundation 9 Part 3: Sizing for Success Making Harbor Production-Ready: Essential Considerations for Deployment Reducing Harbor Deployment Complexity on Kubernetes So far in this blog series, we have highlighted the value that NVMe Memory Tiering delivers to our customers and how this is driving adoption. Who doesn’t want to reduce their cost by ~40% just by adopting VMware Cloud Foundation 9?! We’ve also touched on pre-requisites, and hardware in Part 1 , and design in Part 2 ; so, let’s now talk about properly sizing your environment so you can maximize your investment while reducing your cost. Proper sizing for NVMe Memory Tiering is mainly on the hardware side, but there are two possible ways to look at this; greenfield and brownfield deployments. Let’s start with brownfield deployments, which is adopting Memory Tiering on existing infrastructure. You’ve came to the realization that VCF 9 is truly an integrated product delivering a cohesive cloud like solution and decided to deploy it but just learned about Memory Tiering. Don’t worry, you can still introduce NVMe memory Tiering after deployment of VCF 9. After reading Part 1 and Part 2, we’ve learned the importance of the NVMe performance and endurance classes as well as the understanding the 50% active memory requirement. This means that we need to think about purchasing an NVMe device that is at least the same size of our DRAM, since we will double our memory capacity. So, if each of your hosts have 1TB of DRAM we should at least have 1TB NVMe devices, easy enough. However, we can go bigger and still be cheaper than buying more DIMMS, let me explain. I’ve made it a point to say “buy an NVMe device to be at least the same size of DRAM”, and this is because we use a DRAM:NVMe ratio of 1:1 by default, so half of the memory comes from DRAM and half comes from NVMe. Now, there are workloads that may not be doing a whole lot as far as memory activity, think some VDI workloads.</description></item><item><title>Making Harbor Production-Ready: Essential Considerations for Deployment</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-12-02-making-harbor-production-ready-essential-considerations-for-deployment/</link><pubDate>Tue, 02 Dec 2025 11:58:04 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-12-02-making-harbor-production-ready-essential-considerations-for-deployment/</guid><description>&lt;ol&gt;

To learn more about Harbor and how to deploy it on a Virtual Machine (VM) and in Kubernetes (K8s), refer to parts 1 and 2 of the series. While deploying Harbor is straightforward, making it production-ready requires careful consideration of several key aspects. This blog outlines critical factors to ensure your Harbor instance is robust, secure, and scalable for production environments. For this blog, we will focus on upstream Harbor (v 2.14) deployed on Kubernetes via Helm as our base and provide suggestions for this specific deployment. For a production environment, single points of failure are unacceptable. This is especially true for image registries that acts as a central repository for storing and pulling images and artifacts.&lt;/li&gt;

In this blog, we are going to shed light on two foundational infrastructure services that are enabled and available out of the box when configuring the tenant organization that leverages the K8S Style API: the Virtual Machine Service and the vSphere Kubernetes Service. The Kubernetes declarative API model has already transformed the way organizations build and operate modern applications. But in recent years, the same Kubernetes model has been extended beyond containerized workloads into the world of infrastructure itself. What started with kubectl apply for Pods and Deployments has evolved into using Kubernetes APIs to provision and manage virtual machines, K8S clusters, networking, storage, load balancers, and even databases. Kubernetes is no longer “just the platform for cloud-native apps. ” It’s steadily becoming the universal control plane for both applications and infrastructure. kubectl apply The Virtual Machine (VM) Service in VMware Cloud Foundation 9.0 provides a unified, Kubernetes-native interface for provisioning and managing VMs directly through namespaces. By exposing VM classes, images, storage policies, and networking configurations as declarative Kubernetes resources, the VM Service enables platform and application teams to consume vSphere-backed compute using familiar Kubernetes tooling. This service ensures consistent governance and lifecycle management by enforcing the policies defined at the organization, region, and project levels in VCF Automation, while leveraging vSphere’s mature virtualization capabilities underneath. Below is a detailed walkthrough of the VM provisioning workflow experience in VMware Cloud Foundation Automation. The vSphere Kubernetes Service (VKS) in VMware Cloud Foundation 9.0 delivers a fully integrated, upstream-compatible Kubernetes control plane that runs natively on vSphere.</description></item><item><title>Reducing Harbor Deployment Complexity on Kubernetes</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-11-25-reducing-harbor-deployment-complexity-on-kubernetes/</link><pubDate>Tue, 25 Nov 2025 10:01:39 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-11-25-reducing-harbor-deployment-complexity-on-kubernetes/</guid><description>Deploying Harbor on Kubernetes using Helm Prerequisites Step 1: Download Harbor Deployment Manifests Step 2: Configure values. yaml Step 3: Deploy Harbor Step 4: Verify Harbor Installation Leveraging VKS Standard Packages for Harbor setup Prerequisites: Step 1: Associate a VKS Standard Package Repository Step 2: Deploy Prerequisites (For Production-Ready Harbor) Step 3: Deploy Harbor Step 4: Verify Harbor Installation Deploying Harbor as a Supervisor Service in VCF 9 Prerequisites Step 1: Download and Update the Harbor Supervisor Service YAML Step 2: Deploy the Harbor Supervisor Service Step 3: Monitor the Harbor Supervisor Service Deployment Conclusion Discover more from VMware Cloud Foundation (VCF) Blog Related Articles Harbor: Your Enterprise-Ready Container Registry for a Modern Private Cloud VCF Breakroom Chats Episode 75 - Breaking the GitOps Barrier: Continuous Delivery for Modern Apps with VCF 9 What’s Next for Cloud Native: Highlights from KubeCon North America 2025 Harbor is an indispensable open-source container image registry, offering robust features like policy-driven security, role-based access control (RBAC), vulnerability scanning, image signing, image replication and distribution. Deploying Harbor is a common and critical step for organizations looking to streamline their containerization workflows. As we discussed in our previous blog post , Harbor offers significant value through its comprehensive features and can be deployed on a virtual machine (VM). This blog post will pick up where we left off, guiding you through the process of deploying Harbor on an upstream conformant Kubernetes platform using VMware vSphere Kubernetes Service (VKS) as an example first via Helm, then via VKS standard packages, and finally showcasing the simplified deployment as a supervisor service in VMware Cloud Foundation (VCF) 9. This progression highlights how complexity is progressively reduced at each level. If you are interested to learn more about Harbor and how to deploy it on a VM, check out our previous blog. Before diving into the specifics of VKS, let’s briefly outline the general steps for deploying the bare-minimum components of Harbor on any standard Kubernetes cluster (non production-ready). This foundational understanding will help you grasp the components involved. A running Kubernetes cluster (We will use VMware vSphere Kubernetes Service (VKS) for this, however the process remains the same for any upstream conformant Kubernetes platform).

While the upgrade from 5. x is designed to be streamlined, it introduces mandatory changes in management methodologies and requires careful, phased execution. I’ve previously shared the typical process that VCF Professional Services uses to perform upgrades to VCF 9.0. In my recent webinar with Brent Douglas , I walked through the process (with demos!) of upgrading VCF 5.2 to VCF 9.0. You can find the full webinar replay at the end of this blog, but here are some of the highlights. The webinar starts with an overview of VCF 9.0. This release introduces a unified platform designed to manage both traditional VMs and modern container-based Kubernetes workloads from a single foundation. The new “fleet” construct fundamentally changes how multiple VCF instances are managed, enabling centralized automation and operations across geographically dispersed or logically grouped private clouds. Expanded multi-site, multi-rack, and stretched cluster topologies are now officially supported and documented. VMware SDDC Manager, although currently still available, is being deprecated. Its functions, such as licensing, certificates, and password management, have been migrated to VMware Cloud Foundation Operations which is now a mandatory component in VCF 9.0.</description></item><item><title>Operationalizing the Edge with VMware Cloud Foundation</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-11-20-operationalizing-the-edge-with-vmware-cloud-foundation/</link><pubDate>Thu, 20 Nov 2025 16:22:21 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-11-20-operationalizing-the-edge-with-vmware-cloud-foundation/</guid><description>Now Available: A Fully Automated Deployment Script for Edge Key Benefits of the Automation Script What to Expect from the Script This automation script will cover the following key functions: A Unified Cloud Operating Model from Core to Edge Learn More: Discover more from VMware Cloud Foundation (VCF) Blog Related Articles Operationalizing the Edge with VMware Cloud Foundation VMware Cloud Foundation is the Gold Standard for Virtual Desktop Infrastructure VCF Breakroom Chats Episode 73 - Next-Gen Data Services: The DBaaS Revolution with VCF 9 As organizations extend operations beyond the data center, the edge has become a vital part of their digital strategy. Whether in retail outlets, manufacturing plants, healthcare facilities, energy plants or remote branch offices, IT teams want infrastructure that delivers cloud like agility, consistency and unified operations in the most resource-constrained environments. With VMware Cloud Foundation 9.0 for Edge, a single-host edge site deployment powered by VMware vSphere Supervisor enables organizations to run both VMs and container workloads on the same platform, eliminating the need for separate infrastructure and reducing cost and operational complexity in resource-constrained edge environments. VCF 9.0 also introduces a GitOps model powered by Argo CD Operator, using a centrally managed Git repository as the source of truth, organizations can drive consistent, repeatable and automatically reconciled deployments of VMs and container workloads across multiple distributed edge sites from a single repository simplifying and scaling management across thousands of edge sites. The journey to modernize the edge, as we’ve explored in our previous posts, has paved the way for robust, simplified infrastructure. We’ve introduced the power of the single-node vSphere Supervisor architecture in our series, starting with the Modernizing Your Edge with Single Node vSphere Supervisor blogs. Following that, we demonstrated how application deployment at scale is achieved using a GitOps approach with Argo CD in VCF 9.0 for Edge – Automating App Deployment at Scale with GitOps Using Argo CD. Now, it’s time to bring these concepts together and address the crucial next step: accelerating the infrastructure deployment itself. A core challenge for distributed edge sites is the consistent, rapid, and error-free provisioning of the underlying hardware and software stack. A fully automated deployment script is now available, enabling customers to deploy a single-host vSphere Supervisor environment with Argo CD automation. Automating deployment of vSphere Supervisor and Argo CD at scale minimizes setup time, standardizes configurations, and improves consistency across distributed edge locations. This new automation script streamlines everything from initial cluster configuration to continuous application delivery, helping organizations operationalize the edge faster and more reliably.</description></item><item><title>Mapping VLAN Tags to Virtual Private Cloud Subnets</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-11-20-mapping-vlan-tags-to-virtual-private-cloud-subnets/</link><pubDate>Thu, 20 Nov 2025 15:49:06 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-11-20-mapping-vlan-tags-to-virtual-private-cloud-subnets/</guid><description>Traditional Guest VLAN Tagging (Trunking) Guest VLAN Tagging on NSX Overlay Segments Implementing VLAN-to-Subnet Mapping in a VPC Key Benefits of Subnet-Level Mapping Discover more from VMware Cloud Foundation (VCF) Blog Related Articles Mapping VLAN Tags to Virtual Private Cloud Subnets Unified Authentication in VMware Cloud Foundation SDK 9.0: Seamless authentication across vSphere and vSAN APIs NVMe Memory Tiering Design and Sizing on VMware Cloud Foundation 9 Part 2: Design for Security, Redundancy, and Scalability In a typical virtualized environment, a VM sends untagged traffic from its virtual NIC (vNIC). By default, the virtual switch drops any traffic that carries an 802. 1Q VLAN tag. To allow this traffic, a feature known as Guest VLAN Tagging (GVT) must be explicitly enabled on the vNIC’s port connection. Let’s review how this is traditionally handled before diving into the simple and powerful method available in Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) subnets. On a vSphere Distributed Port Group (dvPortGroup) or a VLAN-backed NSX segment, GVT is enabled by configuring the port as a trunk. This involves specifying a range of allowed VLAN IDs instead of just one. In this trunking model, traffic sent by a VM with VLAN tag X is forwarded onto the physical network, still tagged with VLAN X. The physical network infrastructure is then responsible for handling that tagged traffic. Enabling GVT on an NSX overlay segment (configuring a VLAN range) works similarly at first. Traffic from a VM with a VLAN tag is injected into the overlay segment while retaining its tag. Because NSX sees tagged frames, it treats this as simple Layer 2 traffic.</description></item><item><title>VMware Cloud Foundation is the Gold Standard for Virtual Desktop Infrastructure</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-11-19-vmware-cloud-foundation-is-the-gold-standard-for-virtual-desktop-infrastructure/</link><pubDate>Wed, 19 Nov 2025 19:10:37 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-11-19-vmware-cloud-foundation-is-the-gold-standard-for-virtual-desktop-infrastructure/</guid><description>Security and Compliance Efficiency and Resource Optimization Unfettered Performance Memory Storage Network Graphics Day-2 Operations Use Case: Developer Workbench as a Service Additional Use Cases Introducing the “Omnissa Horizon 8 on VMware Cloud Foundation” Reference Architecture Wrapping Up Additional Resources Discover more from VMware Cloud Foundation (VCF) Blog Related Articles Upgrading VMware Cloud Foundation 5.2 to 9.0: Webinar Takeaways Operationalizing the Edge with VMware Cloud Foundation VMware Cloud Foundation is the Gold Standard for Virtual Desktop Infrastructure VMware Cloud Foundation (VCF) delivers unmatched benefits for virtual desktop infrastructure (VDI). Even after the spin-out of VMware’s End User Computing (EUC) business group into Omnissa , the fundamentals of this combined solution remain intact. However, the release of VCF 9.0 deserves revisiting those fundamentals to expose how the platform holds up. VCF 9.0 consolidates the private-cloud substrate (vSphere, vSAN, NSX) with cloud automation (VCF Automation), integrated Kubernetes (VMware vSphere Kubernetes Service / VKS) and other advanced services for VCF such as VMware Private AI Services and VMware Data Services Manager (DSM). These innovations, among many others, benefit the Omnissa Horizon VDI solution by providing an intrinsically secure, optimized and scalable foundation for the most demanding virtual desktops. Running Horizon on VCF 9.0 allows customers to benefit from the full set of services of a unified private cloud platform. VCF delivers workload domains, orchestrated upgrades, VPC-based network isolation, and a modern consumption API. It’s a platform that treats desktops as first-class workloads. Security is where VCF immediately shines. Use NSX firewall to wrap a least-privilege policy around Horizon Connection Servers, UAGs, and desktop pools without hair-pinning traffic into external firewalls. VCF 9.0’s VPC constructs enable stamping out a repeatable network perimeter for each Horizon function: Edge (UAG) Brokering (Connection Servers) Desktops Shared services These protections scale with the fleet instead of complicating it.

The key highlight of this release was the unification of all the major components into a single deliverable package to deliver simple, extensible, and consistent automation experience across the stack. Currently, the following VCF components are included as a part of the unified VCF SDK and rest of the components will be made available very soon- VMware vSphere VMware vSAN VMware vSAN Data Protection VMware SDDC Manager If you are reading the term Unified VCF SDK for the first time, do not worry about it. You can visit some of the existing content such as the announcement blog post or visit the VMware Explore Las Vegas 2025 session to get yourself up to speed with all the enhancements introduced with VCF APIs and the VCF SDK. In this blog post I will focus on a small yet very effective enhancement to our vSphere API authentication and explain its usage across the vSphere and vSAN APIs. For context, VMware vSphere exposes two major categories of APIs: vSphere Web Services APIs and vSphere Automation APIs. The primary difference between the two lies in their underlying communication protocol. vSphere Web Services APIs use the Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP) protocol. vSphere Automation APIs use Representational State Transfer (REST). If you have ever explored the Managed Object Browser (MOB) from the vSphere Client, you were interacting with the Web Services (SOAP) APIs. In contrast, the API Explorer in the Developer Center exposes the vSphere Automation (REST) APIs. For building complete solutions, developers often need to work with both sets of APIs.</description></item><item><title>The Great Cloud Charade: Why “Data Residency” Isn’t “Data Sovereignty”</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-11-18-the-great-cloud-charade-why-data-residency-isn-t-data-sovereignty/</link><pubDate>Tue, 18 Nov 2025 17:17:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-11-18-the-great-cloud-charade-why-data-residency-isn-t-data-sovereignty/</guid><description>Discover more from VMware Cloud Foundation (VCF) Blog Related Articles Upgrading VMware Cloud Foundation 5.2 to 9.0: Webinar Takeaways VMware Cloud Foundation is the Gold Standard for Virtual Desktop Infrastructure VCF Breakroom Chats Episode 73 - Next-Gen Data Services: The DBaaS Revolution with VCF 9 In the high-stakes world of digital infrastructure and modern sovereign cloud strategy, “sovereignty” has become the ultimate prize. Nations are drafting laws to control their digital territories. Enterprises are scrambling to comply, seeking cloud solutions that promise to keep sensitive data safe within jurisdictional lines. In response, hyperscalers have rolled out a red carpet of “sovereign” offerings for Europe — complete with local data centers, EU-resident staff, and billion-dollar investments. But a critical and often deliberately obscured distinction lies at the heart of this new landscape: the difference between data residency and data sovereignty. They are not the same. One is a feature linked to geography; the other is a control mechanism that defines autonomy. Understanding this difference is key to piercing the marketing veil — and recognizing that many so-called “sovereign public clouds” are, in fact, marketing-speak rather than true sovereign cloud compliance. Data Residency Vs. Data Sovereignty: The Core Distinction: Location vs. Customer Control To engage in a meaningful discussion, we must first establish clear definitions for these frequently conflated terms. Data Residency refers exclusively to the physical, geographic location where data is stored.</description></item><item><title>NVMe Memory Tiering Design and Sizing on VMware Cloud Foundation 9 Part 2: Design for Security, Redundancy, and Scalability</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-11-18-nvme-memory-tiering-design-and-sizing-on-vmware-cloud-foundation-9-part-2-design/</link><pubDate>Tue, 18 Nov 2025 12:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-11-18-nvme-memory-tiering-design-and-sizing-on-vmware-cloud-foundation-9-part-2-design/</guid><description>Security Redundancy Scalability Discover more from VMware Cloud Foundation (VCF) Blog Related Articles Mapping VLAN Tags to Virtual Private Cloud Subnets Unified Authentication in VMware Cloud Foundation SDK 9.0: Seamless authentication across vSphere and vSAN APIs NVMe Memory Tiering Design and Sizing on VMware Cloud Foundation 9 Part 2: Design for Security, Redundancy, and Scalability In Part 1 of this series, we explored some of the pre-requisites for NVMe Memory Tiering such as workload assessment, memory activeness percentage, VM profile limitations, software pre-requisites, and compatibility of NVMe devices. In addition, we highlighted the importance of adopting VMware Cloud Foundation (VCF) 9, which could provide a significant cost reduction in memory, better CPU utilization and greater VM consolidation. But before we can fully deploy this solution it is important we design with security, redundancy, and scalability in mind, and that is what this section is all about. Memory security is not necessarily a super popular topic for admins, and this is because memory is volatile. However attackers can leverage memory to store malicious information on non-volatile media to evade detection, but I digress – this is more a forensics topic (which I enjoy). Once power is no longer present the information on DRAM (volatile) disappears within minutes. So, with NVMe Memory Tiering we are moving pages from volatile (DRAM) to non-volatile media (NVMe). In order to address any security concerns with memory pages being stored on NVMe devices, we have come up with a couple of solutions that our customers can easily implement after initial configuration. With this first release of the Memory Tiering feature, encryption is already part of the package, and ready to be implemented out of the box. In fact, you have the option to encrypt at the VM level (per VM) or at the host level (all VMs in the host). By default, this option is not enabled but can easily be added to your configuration within the vCenter UI. For NVMe Memory Tiering encryption we do not require a Key Management System (KMS) or Native Key Provider (NKP), instead, the key will be randomly generated at the kernel level by each host using AES-XTS encryption.</description></item><item><title>Harbor: Your Enterprise-Ready Container Registry for a Modern Private Cloud</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-11-18-harbor-your-enterprise-ready-container-registry-for-a-modern-private-cloud/</link><pubDate>Tue, 18 Nov 2025 09:52:24 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-11-18-harbor-your-enterprise-ready-container-registry-for-a-modern-private-cloud/</guid><description>What is Harbor Container Registry?

But as the private cloud landscape accelerates and our community’s needs evolve, we’re not just adapting – we’re revolutionizing. We are thrilled to announce the evolution of this iconic program, expanding its reach beyond traditional focus on design roles to welcome a broader range of elite VMware professionals: Architects, Administrators, and Support specialists. To reflect this expanded vision, we are proudly renaming it the VMware Certified Distinguished Expert (VCDX). This isn’t just an update, it is a strategic re-imagining of our VCDX program, designed specifically for individuals like you who aspire to actively define the future of the private cloud. It is also an invitation to build on your deep VMware knowledge, push conventional limits, and pioneer the next generation of private cloud environments, and help pioneer the next generation of private cloud environments. “As VCDX #1 and a founding supporter since 2007, I can attest that the VMware VCDX program is not just a certification—it is the definitive, peer-vetted validation for a distinguished expert. ” – John Arrasjid, VCDX #1 The need for specialized modern cloud expertise has never been more crucial. With 76% of enterprises planning to expand cloud services through private cloud, as highlighted in the Flexera 2024 State of the Cloud Report, the demand for profound cloud intelligence is rapidly accelerating. Yet, a critical challenge persists: a pervasive cloud skills gap. A staggering 95% of IT decision-makers said the cloud skills gap negatively impacted their team, leading to slower innovation and increased operational costs. Even more alarming, nearly a third of organizations are actively jeopardizing their bottom line, having missed their financial objectives due to this critical cloud skills gap.</description></item><item><title>A Decision Framework for Future-Proofing IT Infrastructure</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-11-11-a-decision-framework-for-future-proofing-it-infrastructure/</link><pubDate>Tue, 11 Nov 2025 22:53:57 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-11-11-a-decision-framework-for-future-proofing-it-infrastructure/</guid><description>Discover more from VMware Cloud Foundation (VCF) Blog Related Articles A Decision Framework for Future-Proofing IT Infrastructure Infrastructure Boundaries, Controls, and Policies with VMware Cloud Foundation 9.0 Analyst Insight Series: Virtualization virtue #3: Supporting application modernization With the rise of AI, hybrid cloud environments, and digital transformation initiatives, IT infrastructure is under unprecedented pressure. For IT leaders and enterprise architects, the challenge isn’t just about keeping up—it’s about making strategic, forward-looking decisions while continuing to leverage existing technology investments. In a new paper “ Future-Proofing IT Infrastructure: A Decision Framework for Enterprise Architects ” HyperFRAME Research provides a structured rubric grounded in operational reality to guide this crucial evolution. The framework outlines eight pragmatic steps for infrastructure modernization: Inventory the Current Infrastructure: A successful modernization effort begins by establishing a clear baseline-—a complete picture of existing workloads, deployment patterns, and supporting platforms. This avoids the risk of investing in the wrong solutions. Evaluate Organizational Structure and Team Skillsets: Technology is only as good as the people and processes that support it. Organizations need to rigorously assess their team’s skills and knowledge gaps, and the cost and time required to bridge them. Determine Non-Functional Requirements (NFRs): While functional requirements define what a system does, NFRs—such as performance, scalability, and resilience—dictate how it operates under pressure. Evaluating infrastructure choices with NFRs in mind is essential for ensuring systems can meet business demands. Compare Virtualization and Containerization Options: With a clear understanding of the current environment, team capabilities, and business needs, organizations can determine which compute model best aligns with workload demands and long-term objectives. Evaluate Platform Capabilities and Integration: The enterprise IT environment is complex, with a myriad of individual infrastructure components. Managing it effectively requires a platform that orchestrates these different components into a cohesive, integrated whole, delivering simplicity with agility and flexibility.</description></item><item><title>Infrastructure Boundaries, Controls, and Policies with VMware Cloud Foundation 9.0</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-11-11-infrastructure-boundaries-controls-and-policies-with-vmware-cloud-foundation-9-0/</link><pubDate>Tue, 11 Nov 2025 19:54:21 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-11-11-infrastructure-boundaries-controls-and-policies-with-vmware-cloud-foundation-9-0/</guid><description>Diving Deeper into Self Service VCF Boundaries VCF Policies VCF Automation Policies Discover more from VMware Cloud Foundation (VCF) Blog Related Articles A Decision Framework for Future-Proofing IT Infrastructure Infrastructure Boundaries, Controls, and Policies with VMware Cloud Foundation 9.0 Analyst Insight Series: Virtualization virtue #3: Supporting application modernization As a Solutions Architect here at Broadcom who talks to our customer engineers on the daily, the biggest feedback I get about VMware Cloud Foundation (VCF) 9.0 is a fear (we’ll call it) about having less control with a self service model: “If you want something done right, you have to do it yourself. ” First of all, you will be doing it yourself through the enforcement of boundaries and policies at the onset. You don’t lose control : it is just front-loaded and implemented by applying the policies and boundaries at provisioning. With this approach you actually have more control with less administrative overhead. Second of all, if you are an infrastructure engineer, you are part of “ self” in “ self service” : in a cloud operating model, you will create infrastructure resources the same way everyone else does: using VCF Automation and Operations where your boundaries and restrictions are imposed in a standard and uniform way. Before we dive in, I would be remiss if I didn’t at least mention that VMware infrastructure as a private cloud is not new. Most of the components mentioned below have been around for more than a decade, and they are in the driver’s seat with VCF. If you are a cloud engineer of any sort, you will find yourself right at home with VCF: that’s the whole point. I have talked about this before , albeit indirectly, but like it or not, you provide infrastructure as a service to the people who consume your infrastructure. When you provision a VM, for example, you are providing a virtual machine and everything that goes with it. If it takes days or weeks for that VM to work its way through approvals, or it’s delayed because “we’re waiting on Derek to get back from vacation,” then you’ve already lost. VCF 9.0 provides a cloud native self service model which gives you more control and more security with less effort.</description></item><item><title>VMware Cloud Foundation 9: Now Ready For All Storage</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-11-11-vmware-cloud-foundation-9-now-ready-for-all-storage/</link><pubDate>Tue, 11 Nov 2025 19:12:46 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-11-11-vmware-cloud-foundation-9-now-ready-for-all-storage/</guid><description>VCF 9 is Ready for All vSphere-supported External Storage What about iSCSI, NFS v4.1, and NVMe over Fabrics?

Customers must weigh the benefits of each storage option based on their specific needs and existing investments to optimize their vSphere environments. Customers looking to rapidly adopt VCF 9 have asked for workflows to support all existing supported vSphere storage types, so in our latest version, Broadcom has significantly expanded storage options, now allowing the use of NFSv3 or Fibre Channel VMFS datastores as principal storage for the management workload domain during greenfield deployments. This enhancement builds upon the robust, automated VMware vSAN deployment capabilities already in place. VMware Cloud Foundation (VCF) 9 supports a variety of storage types as principal storage (see Storage Models in the product documentation for more details). Typically, principal storage is configured during creation of the management or workload domains or when adding new clusters to an existing workload domain. These scenarios are referred to as greenfield deployments. Additional principal storage types such as iSCSI, NFS v4.1, and NVMe over Fabrics (FC or TCP), which are not currently available in a greenfield deployment, can now be configured as principal storage for VCF 9 by converging an existing vSphere environment or by using VCF import. If the default cluster includes multiple datastore types, VCF determines the primary datastore using the following priority: vSAN NFS v3 VMFS NFS 4.1 iSCSI This process is documented in KB 416270​​. This is also detailed in the techdocs under converging an existing vSphere environment into a VCF instance. Specifically “Any supported vSphere storage type” is supported. For a list of supported vSphere 9 supported storage platforms see the Broadcom compatibility guide.</description></item><item><title>From Tickets to Clicks: Driving Real Consumption in Your Self‑Service Private Cloud</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-11-11-from-tickets-to-clicks-driving-real-consumption-in-your-self-service-private-clo/</link><pubDate>Tue, 11 Nov 2025 16:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-11-11-from-tickets-to-clicks-driving-real-consumption-in-your-self-service-private-clo/</guid><description>Build once, consume everywhere Consumption succeeds when it’s simple and safe Automation is the new default Security and governance without slowing adoption Private AI and advanced use cases People, process, and measurable outcomes Discover more from VMware Cloud Foundation (VCF) Blog Related Articles VMware Cloud Foundation 9: Now Ready For All Storage From Tickets to Clicks: Driving Real Consumption in Your Self‑Service Private Cloud Analyst Insight Series: Virtualization virtue #3: Supporting application modernization Tired of slow, ticket‑driven provisioning and fragmented cloud operations? The Self‑Service Private Cloud Dummies Guide shows you how to transform your virtual data center into a speed‑first, policy‑driven private cloud that gives developers instant access to the infrastructure they need — while IT keeps full control. This isn’t just about building infrastructure; it’s about creating a product people actually want to consume. By delivering one portal, one API, and one catalog, you provide a seamless experience that accelerates adoption, reduces friction, and delivers measurable business value. Built on VMware Cloud Foundation , this approach flips the script from managing infrastructure to enabling outcomes. The guide serves as a practical playbook for delivering a unified self‑service experience that cloud admins love to operate — and developers love to use. A modern private cloud needs more than infrastructure — it needs a consumption layer that makes adoption effortless. That begins with a unified experience: one portal, one API, and one catalog that serve all workloads, whether VMs, Kubernetes clusters, or GPU‑enabled AI environments. Curated blueprints provide pre‑approved, reusable templates that embed security and compliance into every deployment. Version‑controlled content, delivered through GitOps‑driven workflows, ensures consistency and trust across teams. A developer‑friendly user experience, supported by low‑code and GUI‑driven infrastructure‑as‑code, lowers barriers and drives adoption. The result: teams launch full environments in minutes, not days — and keep coming back. Adoption grows when the platform feels intuitive and trustworthy.</description></item><item><title>Analyst Insight Series: Virtualization virtue #3: Supporting application modernization</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-11-10-analyst-insight-series-virtualization-virtue-3-supporting-application-modernizat/</link><pubDate>Mon, 10 Nov 2025 14:24:50 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-11-10-analyst-insight-series-virtualization-virtue-3-supporting-application-modernizat/</guid><description>Discover more from VMware Cloud Foundation (VCF) Blog Related Articles From Tickets to Clicks: Driving Real Consumption in Your Self‑Service Private Cloud Analyst Insight Series: Virtualization virtue #3: Supporting application modernization VCF Breakroom Chats Episode 69 - Beyond vRA + NSX: Delivering Cloud-Native Networking with VCF 9 Virtual Private Clouds Guest post by Jean Atelsek, Senior Research Analyst,S&amp;amp;P Global Market Intelligence 451 Research This blog is the third in our series on the benefits and trends of virtualization (read blog#1 and blog#2 here) and a companion to the 451 Research Business Impact Brief “ The virtues of virtualization. ” Application modernization means different things to different people, but its universal goal is to make information technology more responsive to business needs. Virtualization – the ability to run multiple operating systems on a single physical machine – planted the seed for the cloud computing paradigm that underlies most modern software development, and it also represents a critical bridge between legacy environments and the container-based and AI-driven deployments revolutionizing how we interact with IT. What does a modern workload look like? Microservices-based architectures, which put software functionality in small, flexible and portable application containers, are one hallmark of cloud-native deployments. 451 Research expects this market to grow at a 15% CAGR to reach $18 billion by 2029. The boom in AI/ML-based workloads is a significant contributor to this forecast. One big challenge of deploying AI workloads is optimizing usage of the powerful graphics processing units (GPUs) needed to efficiently run them. The latest GPUs from NVIDIA, AMD and Intel have been hard to come by due to high demand, and they are expensive when they do become available, with prices reaching up to $40,000 each. The last thing a company wants after provisioning such pricey silicon is to have it sitting idle in a data center waiting to produce a return on the investment. The versatility of virtual machines (VMs) lets organizations “sweat the assets” of their IT environment no matter how heterogeneous the devices supporting it. Decoupling applications from the underlying hardware makes it possible to run software seamlessly across different machines and operating systems. With modern workloads and larger datasets, precious GPU capacity can be accessed and shared more effectively because GPU functionality can be sliced up and distributed at scale to support a variety of programs.</description></item><item><title>VCF Breakroom Chats Episode 69 – Beyond vRA + NSX: Delivering Cloud-Native Networking with VCF 9 Virtual Private Clouds</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-11-10-vcf-breakroom-chats-episode-69-beyond-vra-nsx-delivering-cloud-native-networking/</link><pubDate>Mon, 10 Nov 2025 13:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-11-10-vcf-breakroom-chats-episode-69-beyond-vra-nsx-delivering-cloud-native-networking/</guid><description>VCF Breakroom Chats Episode 69 About the VCF Breakroom Chat Series Discover more from VMware Cloud Foundation (VCF) Blog Related Articles VCF Breakroom Chats Episode 69 - Beyond vRA + NSX: Delivering Cloud-Native Networking with VCF 9 Virtual Private Clouds SAP HANA and SAP NetWeaver Support for vSphere in VMware Cloud Foundation 9.0 on Intel Xeon 6 CPUs with P-core Systems Scaling VMware Cloud Foundation 9.0 Lab Environments using Holodeck 9.0 Welcome to the next episode of the VCF Breakroom Chats.

Definition of aSAPS. Support for Intel Xeon 6 with P-Cores with vSphere 8 was released at the end of September 2025 (see SAP note 3372365 ), enabling seamless migration from vSphere 8 environments to vSphere in VMware Cloud and vSphere Foundation 9. The Intel Xeon 6 platform, with its support for up to 86 cores per socket and increased memory capacity and VCF 9, is an ideal choice for migrating existing virtualized or bare-metal SAP HANA systems from older SAP appliance hardware using CPU generations, such as Cascade Lake, which typically offered 0.75–1 TB per CPU, without the need for re-sizing or significant effort. For example, a previous 4 -socket server running 2 nd Gen Intel Xeon (Cascade or Cooper Lake) 4 TB SAP HANA systems, can get migrated onto a 2 -socket 4 TB Intel Xeon 6 system without resizing required. The benefits of migrating and consolidating existing virtualized or bare-metal SAP HANA systems are clear: Reduced energy consumption Simplified architecture and operation Reduced downtime by leveraging enhanced vSphere features like vMotion or VMware HA Optimized total cost of ownership (TCO) Basic Migration Steps Verify SAP HANA VM sizing and select the appropriate Granite Rapids server configuration to avoid oversizing.</description></item><item><title>Scaling VMware Cloud Foundation 9.0 Lab Environments using Holodeck 9.0</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-11-10-scaling-vmware-cloud-foundation-9-0-lab-environments-using-holodeck-9-0/</link><pubDate>Mon, 10 Nov 2025 07:30:31 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-11-10-scaling-vmware-cloud-foundation-9-0-lab-environments-using-holodeck-9-0/</guid><description>Adding Additional Hosts Adding Additional Clusters Conclusion References Discover more from VMware Cloud Foundation (VCF) Blog Related Articles VCF Breakroom Chats Episode 69 - Beyond vRA + NSX: Delivering Cloud-Native Networking with VCF 9 Virtual Private Clouds Scaling VMware Cloud Foundation 9.0 Lab Environments using Holodeck 9.0 Enterprise customers can now deploy NVIDIA Run:ai on VMware Cloud Foundation When we started building Holodeck 9.0 , the goal was simple — to automate the provisioning of VMware Cloud Foundation (VCF) lab environments using nested ESXi hosts. What began as a development project soon became a tool we actively use for testing real-world VCF use cases. One of Holodeck’s biggest strengths is its scalability and ease of use thus enabling you to easily expand your lab environment even after the initial deployment. If you’re setting up your lab for the first time, check out the official Holodeck 9.0 documentation for detailed guidance. In this post, I’ll walk you through how to add additional ESXi hosts or clusters to an existing Holodeck 9.0 environment. You can easily scale your environment by provisioning additional nested ESXi hosts using the New-HoloDeckESXiNodes cmdlet. This command automates the entire process of deploying nested ESX hosts, configures, powers on, and connects new hosts to the network based on your specified parameters such as CPU, memory, site (‘a’ or ‘b’), and vSAN mode (‘ESA’ or ‘OSA’).

By pooling resources across environments and utilizing advanced orchestration, NVIDIA Run:ai significantly enhances GPU efficiency and workload capacity. We recently announced that enterprises can now deploy NVIDIA Run:ai with the built-in VMware vSphere Kubernetes Services (VKS), a standard capability in VMware Cloud Foundation (VCF). This will help enterprises achieve optimum GPU utilization with NVIDIA Run:ai, streamlining Kubernetes deployment, and supporting both container and VM deployments on VCF. This allows for the deployment of AI and traditional workloads on a single platform This blog explores how Broadcom customers can now deploy NVIDIA Run:ai on VCF leveraging VMware Private AI Foundation with NVIDIA to deploy AI Kubernetes clusters to maximize GPU utilization, streamline operations, and unlock GenAI on their private data. While many organizations default to running Kubernetes on bare-metal servers, this “do-it-yourself” approach often results in siloed islands of infrastructure. It forces IT teams to manually build and manage the very services that VCF provides by design, lacking the deep integration, automated lifecycle management, and resilient abstractions for compute, storage, and networking that are critical for production AI. This is where the VMware Cloud Foundation platform provides a decisive advantage. vSphere Kubernetes Service is the Best Way to Deploy Run:ai on VCF The most effective and integrated way to deploy NVIDIA Run:ai on VCF is by using VKS, which provides enterprise-ready, Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) certified Kubernetes clusters that are fully managed and automated. NVIDIA Run:ai is then deployed onto these VKS clusters, creating a unified, secure, and resilient platform from the hardware up to the AI application. The value is not just in running Kubernetes, but in running it on a platform that solves foundational enterprise challenges: Lower TCO through VCF: Reduce infrastructure silos, leverage existing tools and skill set without retraining and changing processes, and provide unified lifecycle management across infrastructure components.</description></item><item><title>VMware Cloud Foundation Automation – All Apps Organization Configurations</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-11-07-vmware-cloud-foundation-automation-all-apps-organization-configurations/</link><pubDate>Fri, 07 Nov 2025 16:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-11-07-vmware-cloud-foundation-automation-all-apps-organization-configurations/</guid><description>Summary Discover more from VMware Cloud Foundation (VCF) Blog Related Articles VCF Breakroom Chats Episode 69 - Beyond vRA + NSX: Delivering Cloud-Native Networking with VCF 9 Virtual Private Clouds Scaling VMware Cloud Foundation 9.0 Lab Environments using Holodeck 9.0 VMware Cloud Foundation Automation - All Apps Organization Configurations In today’s private cloud world, enterprise IT is evolving from “build and manually manage everything” to “provide agile, self-service infrastructure to application teams,” while still maintaining governance, security, and cost control. With VMware Cloud Foundation Automation , you have a platform delivered by the provider team (or the internal cloud platform team) that hands off a polished, governed, ready-to-use environment to your organization’s administrators, who then enable application teams. In VCF Automation, an organization is a top-level construct created by the provider administrator to represent a tenant or line of business. Each organization operates within its own secure, isolated boundary, ensuring that users can access only the services and resources assigned to them. Organizations consume capacity and cloud services from a shared resource pool, and then subdivide those resources for their application teams — modeled in VCF Automation as Projects and Namespaces. Within each organization, users are assigned roles that define their access and responsibilities, enabling controlled, governed self-service. Think of it like a modern enterprise campus: the provider team has constructed the building — the power, cooling, network backbone, and secure access points. Now the keys are handed over to the organization administrator to define how the space is used — allocating areas for teams, setting access controls, defining shared services, and ensuring everyone can work efficiently within the infrastructure’s boundaries. The foundation is ready — now it’s time to prepare the workspace where applications and teams will thrive. In this blog, we’re focusing on the moment right after the hand-off: you’re the org admin, the region quota has been allocated, the networking plumbing is in place, and your “All Apps” organization is ready for configuration. Why “All Apps Organization”? Because this organization type is designed to support the broadest range of workloads — from traditional VM-based application stacks to containerized microservices platforms— both of which your application teams expect to consume at speed and with consistency. Your role as the organization admin is to set that up once — defining Projects/Namespaces, configuring networking and consumption boundaries, setting identity providers up and user access, and making sure app teams can hit the ground running — all while protecting the underlying infrastructure.</description></item><item><title>Accelerating Kubernetes Innovation through CNCF Contributions</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-11-05-accelerating-kubernetes-innovation-through-cncf-contributions/</link><pubDate>Wed, 05 Nov 2025 14:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-11-05-accelerating-kubernetes-innovation-through-cncf-contributions/</guid><description>Discover more from VMware Cloud Foundation (VCF) Blog Related Articles VCF Breakroom Chats Episode 69 - Beyond vRA + NSX: Delivering Cloud-Native Networking with VCF 9 Virtual Private Clouds Scaling VMware Cloud Foundation 9.0 Lab Environments using Holodeck 9.0 Enterprise customers can now deploy NVIDIA Run:ai on VMware Cloud Foundation Open-source forms the foundation of modern cloud infrastructure, driving key innovations across the industry. At Broadcom, we are not just consumers of open-source projects, we are active contributors and maintainers helping shape CNCF initiatives. Our engineers help address complex operational challenges through direct upstream contributions that make Kubernetes more reliable, scalable, and secure. Broadcom has long been one of the top five contributors 1 to CNCF projects, demonstrating not just participation but genuine leadership in the open-source ecosystem. This isn’t about using open source simply as a consumer but rather strengthening it as a shared foundation for innovation, a practice we uphold across all projects shown in Figure 1. Broadcom’s sustained investment and contributions reflect deep trust in community-driven progress, where collaboration and transparency ultimately serve customers, partners, and the broader industry. Figure 1: Fostering Innovation through Collaboration Challenges for customers By 2029, more than 95% of global organizations will be running containerized applications in production, up from less than 50% in 2023 2. Kubernetes has played a key role as the container orchestration system with adoption at 80% according to a survey conducted by CNCF in 2024 3. In the same survey, 46% of the respondents indicated that open-source projects, including Kubernetes itself, are difficult to understand or run while an equal percentage expressed concerns about the longevity of these projects, and 29% of respondents expressed concerns about security vulnerabilities. While Kubernetes is incredibly powerful and a standard for modern infrastructure, it is also inherently complex. Kubernetes requires integration with dozens of separate tools to achieve enterprise-grade security, compliance, lifecycle management, and consistent operations at scale. Customers are responsible for integrating and operating a complex ecosystem securely and consistently.</description></item><item><title>Workload Placement in VMware Cloud Foundation: Smarter VM Deployment for Performance and Efficiency</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-11-05-workload-placement-in-vmware-cloud-foundation-smarter-vm-deployment-for-performa/</link><pubDate>Wed, 05 Nov 2025 13:24:27 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-11-05-workload-placement-in-vmware-cloud-foundation-smarter-vm-deployment-for-performa/</guid><description>Why Workload Placement Matters How It Works: The “Smart Room Planner” Analogy Business and Operational Intent Expressing Intent with Tags A Real-World Example Workload Placement vs. DRS Final Thoughts Discover more from VMware Cloud Foundation (VCF) Blog Related Articles VCF Breakroom Chats Episode 69 - Beyond vRA + NSX: Delivering Cloud-Native Networking with VCF 9 Virtual Private Clouds Scaling VMware Cloud Foundation 9.0 Lab Environments using Holodeck 9.0 VMware Cloud Foundation Automation - All Apps Organization Configurations When deploying virtual machines (VMs), where they land matters — not just for performance, but for efficiency, compliance, and cost. That’s where Workload Placement in VMware Cloud Foundation (VCF) comes in. It finds the ideal cluster or host for each VM by evaluating real-time capacity, performance data, and your organization’s business or operational intent. In short, it helps ensure every workload lands exactly where it should — without the manual guesswork. If you’ve ever had to manually decide where to deploy a new workload, you know how easy it is to create resource hotspots or imbalance within your clusters. Workload Placement eliminates that uncertainty. By continuously analyzing real-time capacity and performance metrics, VCF automatically recommends — or even performs — optimal VM placements. This ensures your workloads meet performance, compliance, and cost objectives while freeing your teams to focus on innovation instead of firefighting. Think of Workload Placement as a smart room planner for your data center. Each VM is a piece of furniture — some large, some small, all with specific needs. The clusters and hosts are rooms with varying space, lighting, and features.</description></item><item><title>VCF Breakroom Chats | Episode 70: Simplifying Private Cloud with Fleet Management and Lifecycle Management</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-11-04-vcf-breakroom-chats-episode-70-simplifying-private-cloud-with-fleet-management-a/</link><pubDate>Tue, 04 Nov 2025 15:16:14 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-11-04-vcf-breakroom-chats-episode-70-simplifying-private-cloud-with-fleet-management-a/</guid><description>Discover more from VMware Cloud Foundation (VCF) Blog Related Articles VCF Breakroom Chats Episode 69 - Beyond vRA + NSX: Delivering Cloud-Native Networking with VCF 9 Virtual Private Clouds SAP HANA and SAP NetWeaver Support for vSphere in VMware Cloud Foundation 9.0 on Intel Xeon 6 CPUs with P-core Systems VCF Breakroom Chats | Episode 70: Simplifying Private Cloud with Fleet Management and Lifecycle Management Are you looking to improve consistency, eliminate manual upgrade processes, and reduce maintenance downtime to help scale your private cloud deployment?

Although this feature is available at the compute component of VCF (vSphere), we refer to it in the context of VCF given the deep integration with other components such as VCF Operations, which we will refer to in later blogs. Memory Tiering is a new feature included with VMware Cloud Foundation and was one of the main topics of conversation for most of my sessions at VMware Explore 2025. I saw a lot of interest, and a lot of great questions came from our customers on adoption, use cases, etc. This is a multi-part blog series where I intend to help answer a lot of the common questions coming from our customers, partners, and internal staff. For a high level understanding of what Memory Tiering is, please refer to this blog. Before enabling Memory Tiering, a thorough assessment of your environment is crucial. Start by evaluating workloads in your datacenter and pay special attention to memory. One of the key measures we will look at is the active memory of the workload. For workloads to be an optimal candidate for Memory Tiering, we want the total active memory to be 50% or less of the DRAM capacity. Why 50% you ask? Well, the default configuration of Memory Tiering is to provide you with 100% more memory or 2x your memory. So, after enabling Memory Tiering, half of the memory will be coming from DRAM (Tier 0) and the other half comes from NVMe (Tier 1).</description></item><item><title>vSAN Data Protection in VMware Cloud Foundation – The Solution You Already Own</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-11-04-vsan-data-protection-in-vmware-cloud-foundation-the-solution-you-already-own/</link><pubDate>Tue, 04 Nov 2025 13:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-11-04-vsan-data-protection-in-vmware-cloud-foundation-the-solution-you-already-own/</guid><description>Local Protection the Easy Way Simple and Flexible Recovery Fast and Flexible Cloning How to Get Started Install the Virtual Appliance used for vSAN Data Protection Configure Protection Groups Extended Functionality in VCF 9.0 Summary Discover more from VMware Cloud Foundation (VCF) Blog Related Articles Scaling VMware Cloud Foundation 9.0 Lab Environments using Holodeck 9.0 VMware Cloud Foundation Automation - All Apps Organization Configurations Workload Placement in VMware Cloud Foundation: Smarter VM Deployment for Performance and Efficiency With a flurry of announcements and new capabilities offered in VMware Cloud Foundation (VCF) 9.0, it is sometimes easy to overlook relatively new features hidden in plain sight. Protecting data in a private cloud has been a hot topic as of late, extending well beyond just typical data recovery requirements. Customers are looking to devise practical strategies to protect themselves against ransomware attacks and disaster recovery using solutions that are easy to manage at scale. vSAN Data Protection initially debuted in vSAN 8 U3, as a part of VMware Cloud Foundation 5.2. Perhaps the most overlooked aspect of vSAN Data Protection is that it is a part of the VCF license! Why is this so important? If you are running vSAN ESA in your VCF environment, you have everything you need to locally protect your workloads using vSAN Data Protection. It can serve as a terrific way to augment your existing protection strategies or serve as the foundation for more comprehensive protection. Let’s take a brief look at what this local protection can do for you, and how you can adopt it in a simple and scalable way. As a part of your VCF license, vSAN Data Protection gives you the ability to use snapshots the way you always envisioned. Using vSAN ESA’s native snapshotting engine, it allows you to: Easily define groups of VMs and their protection and retention schedules — retaining up to 200 snapshots per VM. Create crash-consistent snapshots of VMs at regular intervals with little to no impact on performance. Easily restore one or more VMs directly in vCenter Server using the vSphere Client, even if they have been removed from inventory. Since vSAN Data Protection protects at the VM level, protecting and restoring discrete VMDKs within a VM is not possible at this time.</description></item><item><title>Forrester Opportunity Snapshot: A Single Platform Approach to Managing Containers and VMs</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-10-31-forrester-opportunity-snapshot-a-single-platform-approach-to-managing-containers/</link><pubDate>Fri, 31 Oct 2025 23:27:45 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-10-31-forrester-opportunity-snapshot-a-single-platform-approach-to-managing-containers/</guid><description>Discover more from VMware Cloud Foundation (VCF) Blog Related Articles Forrester Opportunity Snapshot: A Single Platform Approach to Managing Containers and VMs VCF Breakroom Chats Episode 71: Maximizing VCF Resource Prudency through Capacity Management IDC Spotlight: Overcoming Kubernetes Complexity with Modern Private Cloud Today, technology modernization isn’t a choice—it’s a necessity. IT leaders seeking a competitive edge are prioritizing a modern, resilient infrastructure that can support advanced applications and drive innovation. This new focus is squarely on cloud-native ecosystems, with both containers and virtual machines (VMs) seen as core elements of an enterprise modernization strategy. The challenge, as always, lies in managing increasing complexity. Organizations are running more container and VM management solutions than ever before, often facing issues with siloed infrastructure and operational inefficiencies. Broadcom recently commissioned a Forrester Opportunity Snapshot – “ Modernize Or Fall Behind: Rethinking IT Infrastructure For A Competitive Edge ” — that surveyed 216 IT decision-makers from the US, EMEA, and APAC with influence over their organization’s IT infrastructure strategy and architecture. 84% reported they were struggling to oversee the different tools and platforms used to manage their server virtualization and container management solutions. The demand for a simpler approach is clear: 85% of respondents want a single, unified platform to manage both containers and VMs. This unified approach promises significant benefits beyond simplified management. More than 80% of IT decision makers expect a single platform to increase scalability, streamline infrastructure management, and enhance resource utilization. But this isn’t just about central IT; a unified platform also accelerates DevOps processes and boosts application team agility. Read the report to learn how your peers are thinking about how to address the challenges of deploying and managing both containers and VMs, and how a single, unified platform such as VMware Cloud Foundation can help.</description></item><item><title>Build, Deploy, and Scale with Confidence: vSphere Kubernetes Service 3.5 is Now Live with 24-Month Support</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-10-29-build-deploy-and-scale-with-confidence-vsphere-kubernetes-service-3-5-is-now-liv/</link><pubDate>Wed, 29 Oct 2025 16:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-10-29-build-deploy-and-scale-with-confidence-vsphere-kubernetes-service-3-5-is-now-liv/</guid><description>vSphere Kubernetes release(VKr) 1.34 Advanced Cluster Configuration for Kubernetes Components Cluster API v1beta2 for Enhanced Kubernetes Cluster Management Prevent Upgrade Failures Due to Misconfigured PodDisruptionBudget Streamlined Operations: CLI, Add-On Management, and Support Tools Discover more from VMware Cloud Foundation (VCF) Blog Related Articles Build, Deploy, and Scale with Confidence: vSphere Kubernetes Service 3.5 is Now Live with 24-Month Support VCF Breakroom Chats Episode 71: Maximizing VCF Resource Prudency through Capacity Management Government-Ready NVIDIA AI Enterprise Containers Now Available for Customers of VMware Private AI Foundation with NVIDIA VMware vSphere Kubernetes Service (VKS) 3.5 is now generally available and this new release makes 24-month support available to each Kubernetes minor version, starting with VKr 1.34. We previously announced 24 months of support for vSphere Kubernetes release (VKr) 1.33 in June 2025. This change provides platform teams with greater stability and flexibility when planning upgrades. VKS 3.5 also brings several improvements to operational consistency and lifecycle management, including fine-grained configuration controls for core Kubernetes components, a declarative add-on management model, and integrated support-bundle generation directly from the VCF CLI. Additionally, new upgrade guardrails—such as PodDisruptionBudget validation and compatibility checks—help ensure safer, more predictable cluster upgrades. Together, these enhancements improve reliability, operational efficiency, and Day-2 management for Kubernetes environments at scale. VKS 3.5 enables support for VKr 1.34. Every vSphere Kubernetes minor version is now supported for 24 months from its release date. This reduces upgrade pressure, stabilizes environments, and frees up teams to focus on delivering value instead of constantly planning upgrades. Teams that want quick access to the latest Kubernetes features can stay current with new releases. Those that prefer to run on a stable version for longer can now do so with confidence.

Deploying Generative AI (GenAI) agents (e. g. , research assistants, chatbots) in these environments requires bespoke engineering, manual hardening, and non-repeatable processes. These barriers prevent regulated users from realizing the full benefits of GenAI and agentic AI. To support AI deployments for the public sector and other regulated industries, the NVIDIA AI Factory for Government reference design which includes the latest NVIDIA AI Enterprise release, provides guidance to deploy AI workloads. It is: Built on STIG hardened configurations and requirements for containers Uses FIPS validated cryptographic modules and related capabilities Is subject to ongoing monitoring and remediation of vulnerabilities including CISA KEVs By leveraging this secure, performant reference design through VMware Private AI Foundation with NVIDIA, customers can confidently harness the power of AI to achieve their goals faster and more securely. VMware Private AI Foundation with NVIDIA , a joint AI platform between Broadcom and NVIDIA, enables enterprises to run RAG workflows, fine-tune and customize LLM models, and run inference workloads in their data centers, addressing privacy, choice, cost, performance and compliance concerns.</description></item><item><title>Analyst Insight Series: Consolidated, Consistent and Simplified Operations Deliver on The Promise of Platform Engineering</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-10-28-analyst-insight-series-consolidated-consistent-and-simplified-operations-deliver/</link><pubDate>Tue, 28 Oct 2025 16:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-10-28-analyst-insight-series-consolidated-consistent-and-simplified-operations-deliver/</guid><description>Discover more from VMware Cloud Foundation (VCF) Blog Related Articles Build, Deploy, and Scale with Confidence: vSphere Kubernetes Service 3.5 is Now Live with 24-Month Support VCF Breakroom Chats Episode 71: Maximizing VCF Resource Prudency through Capacity Management Government-Ready NVIDIA AI Enterprise Containers Now Available for Customers of VMware Private AI Foundation with NVIDIA Guest post by Jay Lyman , Senior Research Analyst, S&amp;amp;P Global Market Intelligence 451 Research This blog is the second in our series, “Effective Platform Engineering: Priorities, Pitfalls and Success in Taming Complexity and Managing Today’s Enterprise Infrastructure and Applications. ”(read the first blog here ) and a companion to the analyst report, “ Cost, Productivity, Security Shape Today’s Platform Engineering ” To implement effective platform engineering, enterprise teams must address significant challenges related to complexity and integration across infrastructures, applications, tools and teams. Key to overcoming these challenges are consolidated, consistent and simplified operations that enhance developer productivity, increase cost efficiency, and improve quality and security. Tackling integration and complexity IT teams commonly cite integration and complexity as hurdles to effective platform engineering and DevOps, as highlighted in our Voice of the Enterprise survey (see figure below). Challenges in adopting platform engineering Q. What challenges, if any, do you expect (or have you encountered) in adopting platform engineering? (Select top 3). Base: Respondents whose organizations have platform engineering initiatives. Source: 451 Research’s Voice of the Enterprise: Cloud Native, Platform Engineering 2024. Simplified operations focused on unified lifecycle management can help reduce the complexity of modern enterprise infrastructure and applications, including rapidly evolving tools and platforms such as Kubernetes. While Kubernetes promises effective management of applications and infrastructure at massive scale, it can also introduce complexity due to its various open-source components for orchestration, monitoring, observability and security. These components require centralized and consistent support to enhance operational efficiency, collaboration, governance and control. The platform approach Enterprises can simplify operations by consolidating and ensuring consistency across compute, storage, networking and security resources through a unified platform that can integrate with other tools and platforms across software development and deployment processes.</description></item><item><title>Application Versus Infrastructure-Level High Availability with vSAN in VMware Cloud Foundation</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-10-28-application-versus-infrastructure-level-high-availability-with-vsan-in-vmware-cl/</link><pubDate>Tue, 28 Oct 2025 16:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-10-28-application-versus-infrastructure-level-high-availability-with-vsan-in-vmware-cl/</guid><description>Accommodating for Failure Availability and Recovery of Applications and Data The Evolution of Options in High Availability Application-Level High Availability for Apps and Data Infrastructure-Level High Availability for Apps and Data Different Approaches to Achieve Data Consistency Differences in Recovery Time Objectives (RTO) Which One is Right for You? Summary Discover more from VMware Cloud Foundation (VCF) Blog Related Articles Government-Ready NVIDIA AI Enterprise Containers Now Available for Customers of VMware Private AI Foundation with NVIDIA Application Versus Infrastructure-Level High Availability with vSAN in VMware Cloud Foundation The FinOps Journey: From Visibility to Business Value Maintaining availability of data and the applications that produce or consume that data might be the most important responsibility of data center administrators. Capabilities like high performance or special data services mean very little if the applications and the data they produce or consume is not readily available. Ensuring availability is a complex topic, as application availability and data availability use different techniques to achieve the desired result. Sometimes availability requirements are achieved using infrastructure-level mechanisms, while others may use application-centric solutions. What is best for your environment depends heavily on the requirements and capabilities of your infrastructure. While VMware Cloud Foundation (VCF) can deliver high levels of data and application availability in a simple way , this post will look at the differences in providing high availability of applications and data using application-level technologies versus inherent infrastructure-level technologies in VCF. We will also look at how VMware Data Services Manager (DSM) can play a part in simplifying some of these decisions. Protecting applications and data require an understanding of what typical failures look like, and what a system can do to accommodate for failure. For example, failures in a physical infrastructure may include: Centralized storage solutions like storage arrays Discrete storage devices in distributed solutions Hosts Network interface cards (NICs) Network switching fabrics, causing partitions Site/zone-level failures Failures like these noted above could impact the data, the applications, or both. Failures come in a variety of ways, with some explicitly identified, while others only through absence. Some failures are temporary, while others permanent. Solutions must be sophisticated enough to automatically handle these failure and recovery scenarios.</description></item><item><title>IDC Spotlight: Overcoming Kubernetes Complexity with Modern Private Cloud</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-10-27-idc-spotlight-overcoming-kubernetes-complexity-with-modern-private-cloud/</link><pubDate>Mon, 27 Oct 2025 13:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-10-27-idc-spotlight-overcoming-kubernetes-complexity-with-modern-private-cloud/</guid><description>Take the Next Step Discover more from VMware Cloud Foundation (VCF) Blog Related Articles IDC Spotlight: Overcoming Kubernetes Complexity with Modern Private Cloud Introducing the Private AI Sizing Guide VCF Breakroom Chats Episode 68: Counting down to KubeCon North America 2025 – Let’s Chat!

A sincere thank you from the team to the thousands of folks that downloaded and tried out Holodeck 9.0, we appreciate the engagement and feedback. It’s helped us further shape and grow the tool! In today’s fast-paced technological landscape, the ability to rapidly and reliably test new technical capabilities is paramount. While deploying nested VCF environments has always been possible, it often involves time-consuming manual configurations and significant hardware overhead. Holodeck continues to change the game by providing a self-contained, automated, and repeatable solution that dramatically reduces complexity and resource requirements, now with even more robust features. Some highlights: New-HoloDeckConfig: This cmdlet now validates the integrity of the config. json template. If the template file’s integrity does not match, the user will see a warning before a new config file is created for the Holodeck instance. Ideally, users are not expected to modify the template config file; however, there may be edge cases where a customer chooses to do so. In such cases, the warning ensures they are informed of the change. Remove-HoloDeckInstance: This cmdlet has a new optional parameter to support the automated deletion of the holodeck instance. If not specified, then the instance ID will be captured from the global config file. Also, the prompt for user confirmation is removed, instead, the user will have 15 seconds to abort the operation by pressing any key on the console.</description></item><item><title>Busting Cyber Resilience Myths with VMware Cloud Foundation</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-10-16-busting-cyber-resilience-myths-with-vmware-cloud-foundation/</link><pubDate>Thu, 16 Oct 2025 19:07:43 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-10-16-busting-cyber-resilience-myths-with-vmware-cloud-foundation/</guid><description>Discover more from VMware Cloud Foundation (VCF) Blog Related Articles Busting Cyber Resilience Myths with VMware Cloud Foundation VMware at KubeCon North America 2025: Innovation at the Core of Cloud Native VCF Breakroom Chats Episode 64 - AI Made Simple: Empowering VI Admins to Offer Private AI with VCF 9.0 “What you don’t know, won’t hurt you” is a dangerous assumption when it comes to cyber resilience.

At the time, it felt early. Now, the evidence is undeniable: hearings, regulatory framework being prioritized , and market pivots prove that what mattered then matters even more now. Sovereignty has gone from an abstract concept to a key customer consideration. Establishing a compliance requirement around sovereignty is becoming a key discussion point in Europe. This blog builds on that foundation. We’ll examine why “sovereign by label” clouds fall short, point to real market signals that expose the gap, and lay out a practical checklist that buyers — and vendors — should demand. Because in 2025, the conversation is no longer about who can market sovereignty, but who can prove it. *** Many traditional public cloud vendors now sell “sovereign” clouds. But a label and local data centers do not erase legal exposure, control-plane dependencies, or auditability gaps. Recent admissions and market moves show the problem : when push comes to shove, control, whether in the form of jurisdiction or on data flows matters more than a marketing name. Let’s unpack the different aspects of this reality, point to concrete market signals, and discuss a practical checklist that buyers and platform vendors should demand if they mean “sovereign” in anything but name only.</description></item><item><title>VMware at KubeCon North America 2025: Innovation at the Core of Cloud Native</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-10-13-vmware-at-kubecon-north-america-2025-innovation-at-the-core-of-cloud-native/</link><pubDate>Mon, 13 Oct 2025 16:54:21 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-10-13-vmware-at-kubecon-north-america-2025-innovation-at-the-core-of-cloud-native/</guid><description>What to Expect at the VMware Booth (#1010) Check Out the Demo Theater Session Sign up for Expert-led KubeCon Community Breakout Sessions Dive Deeper into VKS Discover more from VMware Cloud Foundation (VCF) Blog Related Articles VMware at KubeCon North America 2025: Innovation at the Core of Cloud Native VCF Breakroom Chats Episode 64 - AI Made Simple: Empowering VI Admins to Offer Private AI with VCF 9.0 VCF Breakroom Chats Episode 63 - No Experience Needed: Demystifying Kubernetes for Aspiring Cloud Admins with VCF 9.0 KubeCon + CloudNativeCon returns to North America November 10–13, 2025 in Atlanta, and VMware by Broadcom is excited to be a Platinum Sponsor of this important community gathering.

As part of a private cloud strategy, providing a way to consume the underlying infrastructure services and deliver applications quickly all the while managing governance is crucial. With VMware Cloud Foundation (VCF), a number of cloud services are available for consumption, such as VM and Kubernetes Cluster services, along with services for database management, continuous delivery pipelines, service mesh, image registry, and much much more. This blog is an overview of some of the core services like VM and Kubernetes services along with how to apply IaaS resource policies to them. Resource policies help ensure configurations such as cluster sizes are compliant. Security postures such as enforcing a baseline pod security level, and disallowing resources to be deployed, are just a few examples of how to use resource policies. Choice of Consumption Models With VCF, Organization Admins can choose how to isolate users and resources using constructs such as Organizations (tenants), Projects, namespaces, etc. Consumers, such as developers and app teams, also have choice in how they want to consume. The graphic below shows two primary methods: Self-Service Catalog and UI/CLI. Single Platform for Building and Managing Apps VMware Cloud Foundation is a single platform for building and managing applications and services for the entire Organization (tenants). IT teams can run and manage diverse workloads, including AI/ML and cloud native applications. Teams can use a modern interface (UI + code) to facilitate the deployment of services such as databases and VMs.</description></item><item><title>VCF Operations Management Packs: Announcing End of General Support</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-09-30-vcf-operations-management-packs-announcing-end-of-general-support/</link><pubDate>Tue, 30 Sep 2025 16:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-09-30-vcf-operations-management-packs-announcing-end-of-general-support/</guid><description>Additional Information Related Articles VCF Operations Management Packs: Announcing End of General Support Diagnostics for VMware Cloud Foundation Operations - Newest Findings Empowering Platform Engineers with native Kubernetes Multi-Cluster Management in VMware Cloud Foundation Broadcom is announcing End of General Support (EOGS) for the following VCF Operations Management Packs.

This groundbreaking release introduces native K8s multi-cluster management capabilities in VCF accessed through the VCF Automation consumption experience. It’s specifically designed to address the complex challenges that platform engineers face when orchestrating K8s workloads across distributed environments. This capability provides platform engineers with control over their K8s environments, while maintaining the simplicity and operational consistency they need. Its new K8s multi-cluster management capabilities complement built-in private cloud services (VM, vSphere Kubernetes Service (VKS) (K8s runtime), Network, Volume, VM Image) that allow engineers to provision VMs and VKS clusters as K8s objects using K8s manifests. Engineers can use the cloud services and Infrastructure as Code to create version-controlled blueprints (e. g. , for provisioning VKS clusters and deploying applications on them) publishable to a self-service catalog for developers. Together the new native K8s multi-cluster management and cloud services allow organizations to run their entire application portfolio and manage the underlying K8s infrastructure on a single, streamlined platform. Platform engineers face an increasingly complex landscape managing K8s infrastructure due to the exponential growth of containerized applications. Traditional approaches can’t accommodate the operational challenges of modern K8s deployments, which often involve numerous clusters and multiple software elements across various environments. This complexity, compounded by K8s dynamic nature, makes maintaining visibility difficult.</description></item><item><title>VCF Breakroom Chats Episode 61: From VI Admin to Cloud Hero – Building a Multi-Tenant Cloud with VCF 9.0</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-09-26-vcf-breakroom-chats-episode-61-from-vi-admin-to-cloud-hero-building-a-multi-tena/</link><pubDate>Fri, 26 Sep 2025 13:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-09-26-vcf-breakroom-chats-episode-61-from-vi-admin-to-cloud-hero-building-a-multi-tena/</guid><description>About the VCF Breakroom Chat Series Related Articles VCF Breakroom Chats Episode 61: From VI Admin to Cloud Hero - Building a Multi-Tenant Cloud with VCF 9.0 Sydney Sovereign Cloud Day 2025: Where Compliance Meets Innovation How to Upgrade to VMware Cloud Foundation 9.0 Welcome to the latest edition of VCF Breakroom Chats!

Related Articles Sydney Sovereign Cloud Day 2025: Where Compliance Meets Innovation How to Upgrade to VMware Cloud Foundation 9.0 Analyst Insight Series: Virtualization Virtue #2: Stronger Cloud Security and Fault Tolerance The process of upgrading to VMware Cloud Foundation (VCF) 9.0 depends on the version of VCF that you’re currently running as well as a mix of environmental, software and hardware considerations. For example, a specific hardware requirement may have changed and is no longer supported in a later version of VCF. The upgrade process for VCF 5. x has several different paths depending on the starting footprint of the environment. The steps vary depending on which existing VMware Aria Automation and VMware Aria Operations components need to be deployed or upgraded in the environment, as well as any remediations which may be required to the VMware vSphere components. This blog walks through the typical process that VCF Professional Services uses to assess, plan and perform upgrades from VCF 5. x to VCF 9. The first step is to assess and validate the environment. This includes the following: Validate the existing component configuration. This includes checking software components that are installed, their versions, and configuration specifics. For existing Aria Automation and Aria Operations deployments, you must be on the latest release.</description></item><item><title>Analyst Insight Series: Virtualization Virtue #2: Stronger Cloud Security and Fault Tolerance</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-09-23-analyst-insight-series-virtualization-virtue-2-stronger-cloud-security-and-fault/</link><pubDate>Tue, 23 Sep 2025 14:16:58 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-09-23-analyst-insight-series-virtualization-virtue-2-stronger-cloud-security-and-fault/</guid><description>Related Articles Analyst Insight Series: Virtualization Virtue #2: Stronger Cloud Security and Fault Tolerance First VMmark Result Published Using VMware Cloud Foundation 9.0 VCF Breakroom Chats Episode 57: Behind the Code – A Journey from Customer Pain to VCF 9.0 Guest post by Jean Atelsek, S&amp;amp;P Global Market Intelligence This blog is the second in our series on the benefits and trends of virtualization ( read the first blog here , and a companion to the 451 Research Business Impact Brief “ The virtues of virtualization. ” Securing infrastructure, applications and data has always been a tall order for IT, and it grows taller in modern distributed environments: attack vectors multiply as endpoints are added, and access and identity management becomes more complex. The inherent security enabled by virtualization is a key factor behind the staying power of virtual machines in today’s IT estates. VM isolation, network micro-segmentation and live migration allow operations teams to protect the environment and secure data while maintaining high availability. The scale and sophistication of cyberattacks has surged with growing internet connectivity and AI-driven automation: NIST’s National Vulnerability Database shows that in 2024, a record-breaking 40,009 new common vulnerabilities and exposures (CVEs) were discovered, up 38% from the prior year. 451 Research’s Voice of the Enterprise: Information Security, Budgets &amp;amp; Outlook 2024 survey reveals the impact on security teams, with cloud security, AI/ML implementation, GenAI, and data privacy cited as the top pain points. Not long ago, securing applications was seen as an afterthought, with controls applied after development and before deployment into production, but in today’s dynamic environments this is no longer sufficient. The key is to “shift left” and apply controls by default without losing up-to-the-minute availability of resources for developers. Virtualization accomplishes this by creating an isolated environment for each virtual machine, thereby reducing the attack surface, ideally with out-of-the-box configurations for protecting data, implementing hardening and security best practices, authenticating users (including non-human identities such as AI agents), and rotating certificates automatically. To ensure high availability, VMs benefit from redundancy—periodically saving snapshots in a remote location so configurations can be restored in case of an outage—and the ability to do live migration between physical hosts. Because virtualization defines machine characteristics in software, failover can be “designed in” to the environment to automatically recover without impacting the user experience. This advantage applies not only during emergencies but also when upgrading underlying hardware.</description></item><item><title>The FinOps Journey: From Visibility to Business Value</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-09-23-the-finops-journey-from-visibility-to-business-value/</link><pubDate>Tue, 23 Sep 2025 12:50:15 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-09-23-the-finops-journey-from-visibility-to-business-value/</guid><description>FinOps Maturity Phases Phase 1: Shedding Light on IT Costs Phase 2: Planning Ahead Phase 3: Running IT Like a Business Final Thoughts Related Articles The FinOps Journey: From Visibility to Business Value Capacity Management: The IT Balancing Act You Can’t Ignore Deploy Distributed LLM Inference with GPUDirect RDMA over InfiniBand in VMware Private AI Let’s be real — IT costs can be a black box. Servers hum, invoices arrive, and before you know it, your cloud spend is climbing faster than your budget can keep up. That’s where FinOps comes in. If you haven’t heard the term before, Financial Operations (FinOps) is all about bringing financial discipline to the way you run IT. It’s the practice of tracking, forecasting, and optimizing spending on IT resources so that every dollar works harder. FinOps isn’t just for the big players anymore. What started as a process for larger service providers has now been embraced by smaller businesses, giving them the same ability to control cloud costs, improve efficiency, and drive smarter financial decisions. Why? Because when IT understands the true cost of delivering services, it stops being “just” a cost center and becomes a strategic business partner. And every organization’s path to FinOps maturity is different, but most will move through these three phases. Phase 1: Gaining an understanding of their costs (Inform) Phase 2: To planning and budgeting for future projects (Optimize) Phase 3: To ultimately, running IT like a business (Operate) The good news? Regardless of where you are in the process, VMware Cloud Foundation and its FinOps capabilities can help at every step. Phase 1 of the FinOps journey begins with understanding and managing your costs. Why This Matters: Financial Operations (FinOps) is about more than just saving money.</description></item><item><title>First VMmark Result Published Using VMware Cloud Foundation 9.0</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-09-19-first-vmmark-result-published-using-vmware-cloud-foundation-9-0/</link><pubDate>Fri, 19 Sep 2025 17:44:10 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-09-19-first-vmmark-result-published-using-vmware-cloud-foundation-9-0/</guid><description>Related Related Articles First VMmark Result Published Using VMware Cloud Foundation 9.0 VCF Breakroom Chats Episode 57: Behind the Code – A Journey from Customer Pain to VCF 9.0 10 VMware Cloud Foundation 9.0 Enhancements: Simplifying Your Day 2 Operations We are excited to announce the first VMmark 4 result using our latest release, VMware Cloud Foundation (VCF) 9.0.

In previous versions such as VCF 5.2, many administrative tasks—such as network pool creation, host commissioning, and workload domain deployments—were tightly coupled with SDDC Manager and performing them outside of it often led to issues. VCF 9.0 introduces significant enhancements in Day 2 operations, offering greater flexibility by shifting many of these tasks to more familiar tools such as VMware vCenter and VCF Operations. This evolution not only streamlines workflows but also empowers administrators with more direct control. This post highlights 10 key operational changes that organizations should consider when planning and executing an upgrade to VCF 9.0. While not an exhaustive list, these insights are based on recurring themes in customer conversations and real-world upgrade experiences. In VCF 5.2, network pool creation, expansion, and deletion are performed in SDDC Manager. Administration -&amp;gt; Network Settings -&amp;gt; Network Pool In VCF 9.0, these tasks are performed through vCenter. You do not need any additional configuration to act on the Management Domain networks, however you must be using VCF SSO and vCenter Server Linking for Workload Domains. Global Inventory List -&amp;gt; Hosts -&amp;gt; Network Pools In VCF 5.2, host commissioning/decommissioning for existing or new workload domains are done in SDDC Manager.

By granting VMs exclusive, high-performance access to NVIDIA GPUs, DirectPath allows organizations to fully harness GPU capabilities without added licensing complexity. This makes it easier to experiment, prototype, and move AI projects into production with confidence. Besides, VMware Private AI brings models closer to enterprise data, delivering secure, efficient, and cost-effective deployments. Jointly engineered by Broadcom and NVIDIA, the solution empowers organizations to accelerate innovation while reducing total cost of ownership (TCO). These advancements come at a critical time. Serving state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs) like DeepSeek-R1 , Meta Llama-3.1-405B-Instruct , and Qwen3-235B-A22B-thinking at full context length often exceeds the capacity of a single 8x H100 GPU server, making distributed inference essential. Aggregating resources from multiple GPU-enabled nodes allows these models to run efficiently, though it introduces new challenges in infrastructure management, interconnect optimization, and workload scheduling. This is where VMware Cloud Foundation (VCF) plays a vital role. VCF is the industry’s first private cloud platform to deliver public cloud scale and agility while providing on-premises security, resilience, and performance—all with lower TCO. Leveraging technologies such as NVIDIA NVLink , NVSwitch , and GPUDirect® RDMA , VCF enables high-bandwidth, low-latency communication across nodes. It also ensures that network interconnects like InfiniBand (IB) and RoCEv2 (RDMA over Converged Ethernet) are used effectively, reducing communication overhead that can limit distributed inference performance.</description></item><item><title>VMware Cloud Foundation Support Upgrade Playbook</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-09-15-vmware-cloud-foundation-support-upgrade-playbook/</link><pubDate>Mon, 15 Sep 2025 13:28:19 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-09-15-vmware-cloud-foundation-support-upgrade-playbook/</guid><description>Related Related Articles VMware Cloud Foundation Support Upgrade Playbook VCF Breakroom Chats Episode 58: A Smarter Way to a Unified Private Cloud Consumption Experience with VCF 9.0 Boost Operational Efficiency with VMware Cloud Foundation Our VMware Support team here at Broadcom is fully committed to helping our customers on their upgrade journeys.

VMware Cloud Foundation (VCF) brings together private cloud infrastructure with FinOps principles to help ensure financial accountability, operational visibility, and business alignment for all IT users. The FinOps framework in VCF enables enterprises to not only provision infrastructure but also optimize, govern, and allocate costs intelligently across developers and providers. In an era where IT infrastructure costs are rapidly escalating, particularly with the rise of AI initiatives, enterprise organizations demand greater control and visibility over their expenditures. This necessitates not only refined service metering and billing, but also the ability to accurately capture and view the Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) and overall expenses. Concurrently, IT teams face the challenge of optimizing infrastructure to reduce costs and promote resource reuse, while also refining service metering and billing for a diverse array of modern services, including VMs, AI services, database services, Kubernetes services, and storage services. VCF cost management monitors and controls infrastructure spend by improving transparency, enabling cost governance, and supporting accurate budgeting. Delivered through a single pane of glass, VCF enables cost visibility, analysis, budgeting, optimization, and ROI insights while enabling showback for transparency and chargeback with customizable billing models—empowering enterprises to manage expenses, ensure accountability, and compare costs against public cloud efficiently. VMware Cloud Foundation (VCF) brings robust chargeback capabilities that cater to the unique needs of both enterprises and cloud service providers. For enterprises, VCF enables internal IT teams to bill back projects and application groups based on the resources they consume, creating financial accountability and promoting efficient usage. On the other hand, cloud service providers can leverage the same framework to track, meter, and charge tenants for the services delivered, ensuring fairness and transparency. By combining metering with data- and logic-backed billing, VCF empowers providers to generate accurate, itemized bills while giving consumers confidence that they are only paying for what they use.</description></item><item><title>Deploy VMware Private AI on HGX servers with Broadcom Ethernet Networking</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-09-10-deploy-vmware-private-ai-on-hgx-servers-with-broadcom-ethernet-networking/</link><pubDate>Wed, 10 Sep 2025 04:14:57 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-09-10-deploy-vmware-private-ai-on-hgx-servers-with-broadcom-ethernet-networking/</guid><description>What’s Covered in the White Paper?

By extension, it is also a key consideration when implementing platform engineering practices and processes to manage cloud-native environments. To overcome the array of complexity-related challenges across infrastructures, applications, tools, and teams, enterprise organizations must enable simplified operations and maintain consistency with federated platforms that can integrate and evolve with a variety of technologies. Consolidated, unified platforms that support integration across venues and software components are critical to overcoming complexity. For Kubernetes, this also means supporting the many different open source components that make up an effective deployment, including orchestration, monitoring and observability, and security functions. Further, as cloud-native constructs and containers are deployed across a broader swath of enterprise applications, teams must centrally and consistently manage both container-based and VM-based applications on a single platform. Much like DevOps, platform engineering relies on breaking down silos within an organization to support teams and personas beyond software developers and IT admins (e. g. , cloud admins, platform engineers, security teams) with self-service capabilities, as well as aligned objectives and incentives to foster collaboration. Comprehensive, end-to-end platforms that seamlessly connect compute, storage, networking, and security resources with unified lifecycle management, and that also facilitate integrations across the software development and deployment process, can help enterprises to better support their broad array of applications and teams. This can help address complexity issues by allowing teams to centrally and consistently manage platforms using a common skillset, further reducing costs by reducing the need for new hires and talent acquisition. Conquering complexity and integration challenges associated with platform engineering can enable improved developer productivity, faster delivery time, improved security and higher-quality code—sought-after benefits that are frequently identified in our Voice of the Enterprise surveys.</description></item><item><title>New Research Reveals: Cloud Maturity is the Key to Private Cloud Success</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-09-04-new-research-reveals-cloud-maturity-is-the-key-to-private-cloud-success/</link><pubDate>Thu, 04 Sep 2025 19:04:09 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-09-04-new-research-reveals-cloud-maturity-is-the-key-to-private-cloud-success/</guid><description>Enterprises at mature stages of cloud adoption are 3x more likely to achieve their cloud goals and see dramatically better results across satisfaction, cost efficiency, and performance. The Private Cloud Renaissance The Maturity Advantage: A Game-Changing Discovery The Strategic Repatriation Trend What Separates the Leaders The Path Forward Ready to Assess Your Cloud Maturity? Related Articles New Research Reveals: Cloud Maturity is the Key to Private Cloud Success Broadcom and Canonical Partner to Fast-track and Secure Containerized Workload Deployments on VMware Cloud Foundation Strengthened Cyber-Risk Management and Compliance for Large-Scale VMware Cloud Foundation Environments Today, we’re excited to announce the release of our special edition report: “ Private Cloud Outlook: The Maturity Advantage. ” The research reveals a pivotal shift in how enterprises approach cloud strategy—and uncovers a critical success factor that separates high-performing organizations from the rest. Enterprises are fundamentally rethinking their cloud strategies, placing private cloud at the center to address today’s most pressing business challenges. While security, cost control, and data governance remain primary drivers, our research shows that private cloud has evolved into a powerful enabler for modern workloads, including AI initiatives. But here’s what’s truly fascinating: the benefits of private cloud aren’t just about the technology—they are about deployment maturity which also brings along people and process. When we analyzed responses through the lens of cloud maturity, a striking pattern emerged that reveals why some enterprises are pulling dramatically ahead of their peers. Enterprises that are mature in their cloud journey experience significantly superior results in strategic impact and operational excellence. They are investing in their infrastructure to drive business goals: 59% are increasing their private cloud investments, compared to 38% of developing-stage peers 60% rank private cloud workloads as their top IT priority, compared to 41% of developing-stage peers 90%+ report satisfaction in infrastructure operations, application deployment, security and compliance, compared to 50-65% satisfaction for developing-stage peers Perhaps most telling is the workload repatriation trend we discovered. Mature enterprises are 3x more likely to have repatriated workloads from public cloud , with 50% having brought modern, cloud-native applications back to private infrastructure. This isn’t about reversing failed migrations—it’s a deliberate, strategic move driven by heightened security concerns, rising costs, and the growing demands of modern workloads like AI. Our research identified six critical dimensions that determine cloud maturity progress across people, process and technology: Workload diversity – Successfully running both traditional and modern applications Self-service provisioning – Enabling tenant self-provisioning via catalogs and APIs Policy-based guardrails – Implementing automated governance for security and compliance Cost transparency – Providing chargeback/showback information to internal customers Platform model – Organizing around platform teams vs.</description></item><item><title>Transfer VMware Cloud Foundation (VCF) Operations Integration SDK Builds to a Private Container Registry in the deployed VCF Operations Environment</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-09-02-transfer-vmware-cloud-foundation-vcf-operations-integration-sdk-builds-to-a-priv/</link><pubDate>Tue, 02 Sep 2025 21:14:29 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-09-02-transfer-vmware-cloud-foundation-vcf-operations-integration-sdk-builds-to-a-priv/</guid><description>Context Steps to transfer VCF Operations Integration SDK builds from build container registry to a private registry in deployed VCF Operations environment Steps to be performed in the Integration SDK’s build environment Steps to be performed in the deployed VCF Operations environment Credits Related Articles Transfer VMware Cloud Foundation (VCF) Operations Integration SDK Builds to a Private Container Registry in the deployed VCF Operations Environment VMware Cloud Foundation - Cloud on Your Terms VMware Cloud Services Portal migration to the Broadcom Cloud Console VMware Cloud Foundation (VCF) Operations offers comprehensive IT management, focusing on proactive operations and security. It monitors, manages, and optimizes IT operations by collecting data using management packs. VCF Operations includes built-in packs for components like vCenter and VCF. Additionally, it provides tools—a management pack builder and an Integration SDK—that enable users to develop custom management packs for monitoring applications and infrastructure components not covered by the built-in options. These user-developed management packs can be uploaded and deployed to specific environments, allowing organizations to tailor their monitoring capabilities and integrate diverse technologies within their VCF ecosystem. The Integration SDK provides tools and libraries in Python and Java to aid in development of management packs to add custom objects, data, and relationships from an endpoint into VCF Operations. The Integration SDK generates containerized management packs and hence requires a container registry for its storage and retrieval. This container registry must be accessible by the VCF Operations Cloud Proxies to download the container. By default, the Integration SDK’s build environment’s container registry must be accessible by the VCF Operations Cloud proxies in the intended deployment environment. In most scenarios, the container registry used by the Integration SDK’s build environment is accessible by the VCF Operations Cloud Proxies in the deployed environment. However, in the following situations, Integration SDKs build environment’s container registry may not be accessible by the VCF Operations Cloud proxies in the intended deployment environment: VCF Operations has been deployed in an air-gapped environment and there is no connectivity to the internet to access public container registry. The VCF Operations Integration SDK’s build environment has used a private container registry and there is no connectivity from the customer’s infrastructure to this private container registry.</description></item><item><title>From VLAN Tag to Segment: Using Guest VLAN Tagging in NSX</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-08-29-from-vlan-tag-to-segment-using-guest-vlan-tagging-in-nsx/</link><pubDate>Fri, 29 Aug 2025 18:16:13 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-08-29-from-vlan-tag-to-segment-using-guest-vlan-tagging-in-nsx/</guid><description>Guest VLAN Tagging alone… not great with NSX Mapping VLAN Tags to NSX Segments Step 1 – Attach the VM to a segment Step 2 – Convert the VM’s port into a parent port Step 3 – Create child ports for each VLAN Notes Configuration steps VM Configuration Creation of a child port using API Step 1 – Retrieve the VM’s Port Step 2 – Convert the Port into a Parent Port Step 3 – Create a Child Port for VLAN 10 Creation of a Child Port for via UI Related Articles From VLAN Tag to Segment: Using Guest VLAN Tagging in NSX Save Costs and Scale Efficiently with vSAN Deduplication in VMware Cloud Foundation 9.0 How to Connect your VMware Private AI Services Agents to OpenWeb UI By default, a virtual machine sends traffic to its vNIC untagged. The virtual switch then receives that traffic into a single VLAN or NSX segment. This model limits a VM to connecting to at most 10 networks directly. But what if we need to connect the VM to more than 10 networks? With VLAN-backed networking, this is where Guest VLAN Tagging (GVT) comes in. When Guest VLAN Tagging is enabled on a port group, the VM itself is responsible for inserting VLAN tags (802. 1Q C-TAGs) into the frames it transmits. The virtual switch then uses the tag to direct the frame to the correct VLAN. With this approach, a single vNIC can access up to 4,094 VLAN-backed networks , dramatically increasing connectivity without adding more virtual NICs. Guest VLAN Tagging is enabled by specifying a VLAN ID range on the port group. For example, if you configure a range of 10–20, the vNIC will accept traffic tagged with VLAN IDs from 10 to 20, while dropping traffic tagged with IDs outside that range. The VM’s operating system must, of course, be configured to generate the appropriate VLAN-tagged subinterfaces. Guest VLAN Tagging can also be configured on NSX segments in a similar way, but there is an important difference: NSX segments are not identified by VLAN IDs.</description></item><item><title>VMware Cloud Foundation – Cloud on Your Terms</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-08-29-vmware-cloud-foundation-cloud-on-your-terms/</link><pubDate>Fri, 29 Aug 2025 16:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-08-29-vmware-cloud-foundation-cloud-on-your-terms/</guid><description>Related Articles VMware Cloud Foundation - Cloud on Your Terms VMware Cloud Services Portal migration to the Broadcom Cloud Console Broadcom and Canonical Partner to Fast-track and Secure Containerized Workload Deployments on VMware Cloud Foundation At Broadcom, we are committed to empowering our customers to build and manage modern private clouds on their own terms.

In this blog, we’ll take a step behind the curtain to see how these capabilities are running in VCF, using AI features that our customers can also use to build their own AI experiences with their own private data. VMware Private AI services enable administrators to safely and securely import and share approved AI models (Model Gallery and Model Governance); scale and run Models as a Service for their organization (Model Runtime and ML API gateway); create Knowledge bases and regularly refresh data in a fully supported vector database for creating RAG applications (Data Indexing and Retrieval Service in partnership with Data Services Manager); and provide developers a UI where they can compose models, knowledge bases, and tools together to create Agents (Agent Builder). The Intelligent Assist service is using these capabilities to run the Intelligent Assist agent, and VCF engineering teams are using these services as a common AI platform to deliver joint services and AI workflows. Customers can also use these same capabilities for their own teams. These features give private cloud administrators what they need to safely download, validate, and share models with teams across their cloud. Learn about how to safely onboard popular models from upstream and ensure the model’s behavior meets your enterprises’ expectations and requirements – and behavior doesn’t drift over time in this blog post. Now that you have models securely imported and shared with the right folks in your organization, you will want to run them in an efficient and scalable way. Gone are the days of every division running their own separate copies of the same popular models – instead your team can provide Models as a Service using the Model Runtime. Deploy models on a fully maintained runtime stack from directly within VCF, and then horizontally scale them as they come under load with no end user impact, as users broker their requests via the ML API gateway. This also gives you flexibility to do rolling upgrades of models with zero end user impact. This method of deploying models allows separate lines of business or tenants within a Cloud Service Provider to keep their data separate from each other while ensuring high GPU utilization.</description></item><item><title>Engineering the Next Generation of VMware Cloud Foundation</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-08-26-engineering-the-next-generation-of-vmware-cloud-foundation/</link><pubDate>Tue, 26 Aug 2025 12:30:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-08-26-engineering-the-next-generation-of-vmware-cloud-foundation/</guid><description>VMware Cloud Foundation – The Platform For What’s Next Infrastructure at the Speed of the Developer Private AI as a Service Taking It Further with VCF Advanced Cyber Compliance The Path Forward Related Articles Broadcom and Canonical Partner to Fast-track and Secure Containerized Workload Deployments on VMware Cloud Foundation Strengthened Cyber-Risk Management and Compliance for Large-Scale VMware Cloud Foundation Environments Building your GenAI Agents on VCF with Private AI Services The private cloud is entering a new era. The workloads our infrastructure must serve have shifted from traditional applications only to also include distributed systems, data-intensive analytics, and AI-driven models that demand unprecedented agility and scale.

But the requirements are evolving—and so must the platform. And VMware Cloud Foundation isn’t just adapting to enterprise transformation – it’s leading it. VCFis the engine driving how modern businesses reimagine their infrastructure, applications, and data strategies. Each new innovation isn’t a reaction to where the industry is going—it sets the pace for what’s possible in the private cloud – whether it’s in a central datacenter, edge or in the hyperscaler environment. VCF 9.0 set the benchmark for the modern private cloud: Sovereign by Design – Data residency tags, geo-fencing, and automated certificate rotation to embed compliance into the platform. Operational Simplicity – New installer, unified fleet management, and streamlined lifecycle operations reduce deployment and maintenance overhead. Modern App Platform – vSphere Kubernetes Service and VM Service deliver VMs and containers side by side with GitOps-driven automation.

The ever-evolving risks presented by today’s modern threat landscape pose unprecedented challenges that most today are ill-equipped to address. With ransomware attacks becoming increasingly sophisticated and regulatory guidelines more stringent, cyber-risk management and compliance lie at the core of every strategic IT decision made by C-Suite executives and board members. 51% of leaders reported security, data protection and privacy as key priorities to enable compliant operations 1. However, the path to achieve successful outcomes is beset with obstacles. Why Organizations Struggle to Manage Cyber-Risk and Maintain Compliance Reactive vs. Proactive Response: data is scattered across different applications in multiple geographic locations, each with its own rules and regulations. 63% of organizations report that complexity from the disaggregated nature of data as the main challenge to maintain compliance 2. Policy monitoring for virtual machines (VMs), containers, databases, infrastructure and technology stack components is siloed, which hinders early detection of drifts and leads to a reactive versus proactive response. Manual Remediation and Recovery: policy management and recovery lack automation, which directly impacts an organization’s ability to scale operations and preserve compliance as applications are changed, moved or deleted.
