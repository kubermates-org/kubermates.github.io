The same week, another team spent an entire night hunting phantom load balancer bugs when a certificate rotation had broken mobile clients with certificate pinning. These aren’t stories about incompetent engineers. These are stories about brilliant people falling into the same cognitive trap that catches everyone: diving deep instead of looking broad. Here’s what happened with the kubectl disaster. The symptoms looked serious: cron jobs failing, secrets not updating across namespaces, image pulls crashing left and right. Classic distributed systems chaos, right? The team immediately went into full forensic mode. Pod logs. RBAC permissions. Service account configurations.

But what about the underlying nodes themselves, the very foundation on which our workloads run? The attack surface that Kubernetes nodes expose is vast and, if left unprotected, can become a golden ticket for malicious actors. Cilium host firewall is built to lock down the host network namespace with precision, visibility, and control, extending the same familiar declarative Kubernetes network policy model to the underlying host. In this blog post, we’ll explore what Cilium Host Firewall is, how it works, and why it should be a core part of your Kubernetes security. Kubernetes native network policies don’t apply to host-level traffic. This means any communication that enters or leaves the host directly (for example, SSH, kubelet, or external monitoring agents) is largely invisible to traditional Kubernetes policy enforcement. While some firewalling is possible via firewalld or external systems, managing those rules is brittle and lacks integration with Kubernetes. At its core, this is the problem Cilium Host Firewall solves. Leveraging eBPF, Cilium introduces host firewalling directly into the fabric of the cluster. Cilium treats the node as a special type of endpoint with the label reserved:host. This lets us apply policies just like we would for pods, except these apply to traffic to and from the node(s) themselves.

Developer Experience That Preserves Governance: Preconditions and Postconditions From Configuration to Contract-Driven Infrastructure Posted on September 2, 2025 by Anshul Sao, Co-Founder &amp;amp; CTO at Facets. cloud CNCF projects highlighted in this post It’s 2AM. You’re staring at a failed deployment pipeline, trying to figure out why your EKS cluster can’t find the right subnets. You’ve checked the variables, verified the outputs, and triple-checked your depends_on statements. Everything looks correct, yet it still fails. This scenario plays out daily across organizations that have adopted Terraform. While modules promised composable, reusable infrastructure, the reality has become a complex web of string-matching, implicit dependencies, and tribal knowledge. How much of your team’s time is spent debugging module connections rather than delivering value? Every time a team provisions infrastructure for a new service or application, they pay an invisible tax in cognitive overhead: For each input a module needs, someone must make critical decisions: Is this value a hard-coded constant? A data lookup? An output from another module? The answer differs for every project and environment, so this decision tree must be rebuilt from scratch each time.</description></item><item><title>Cartografos Community Meeting</title><link>https://kubermates.org/events/2025-09-02-cartografos-community-meeting/</link><pubDate>Tue, 02 Sep 2025 17:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/events/2025-09-02-cartografos-community-meeting/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Bi-weekly community meeting for the Cartografos Working Group.

Half a decade ago, we celebrated Jaeger’s fifth anniversary , marveling at its growth from a nascent idea to a critical component in the observability stack. Today, as we mark 10 years, we’re not just celebrating longevity; we’re celebrating a profound evolution. Jaeger has been reborn, embracing a future built on collaboration, standardization, and the incredible momentum of OpenTelemetry. For years, the most significant barrier to adopting distributed tracing wasn’t the backend. It was instrumentation. Getting telemetry data out of applications was a complex, often proprietary, and labor-intensive process. Every tracing system had its own SDKs, its own agents, and its own way of doing things. This fragmentation created vendor lock-in and a steep learning curve, hindering widespread adoption. This is where OpenTelemetry changed everything. It didn’t just offer another SDK; it advanced the entire practice of instrumentation. By providing a single, vendor-neutral standard, OpenTelemetry unified both manual instrumentation (SDKs) and automatic instrumentation (agents).</description></item><item><title>Unlocking Platform Engineering for Organizational Success and The Journey to the Beginning of the Edge with Talos Kubernetes</title><link>https://kubermates.org/events/2025-09-01-unlocking-platform-engineering-for-organizational-success-and-the-journey-to-the/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Sep 2025 14:30:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/events/2025-09-01-unlocking-platform-engineering-for-organizational-success-and-the-journey-to-the/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Join us for an exciting evening where we dive into two transformative topics:First, discover the world of Team Topologie&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>#cTENcf Birthday Bash Ranchi</title><link>https://kubermates.org/events/2025-08-31-ctencf-birthday-bash-ranchi/</link><pubDate>Sun, 31 Aug 2025 13:30:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/events/2025-08-31-ctencf-birthday-bash-ranchi/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Celebrating the 10th year of CNCF Communities and the CNCF LandscapeThis edition is extra special — we’re celebrating 10&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>#cTENcf party - USAC - 10 años de CNCF</title><link>https://kubermates.org/events/2025-08-30-ctencf-party-usac-10-a-os-de-cncf/</link><pubDate>Sat, 30 Aug 2025 17:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/events/2025-08-30-ctencf-party-usac-10-a-os-de-cncf/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Celebrate 10 years of CNCF!, Nuestra comunidad esta celebrando los 10 años de CNCF, 10 años, 200 proyectos y más de 275000 contribuidores, únete a nosotros en la USAC para celebrar juntos.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Announcing Kyverno Release 1.15!</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-08-30-announcing-kyverno-release-1-15/</link><pubDate>Sat, 30 Aug 2025 13:31:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-08-30-announcing-kyverno-release-1-15/</guid><description>TL;DR New Policy Types MutatingPolicy: Flexible Resource Transformation GeneratingPolicy: Intelligent Resource Creation DeletingPolicy: Controlled Cleanup Made Easy Pod Security Standard(PSS) Policy Performance: ClusterPolicy vs ValidatingPolicy Key Performance Improvements Why It Matters New OpenReports API Group Support Community &amp;amp; Contributions Getting Started What’s Next? Conclusion Posted on August 30, 2025 by The Kyverno Team CNCF projects highlighted in this post Kyverno 1.15 makes Kubernetes policy management more powerful, extensible, and user-friendly. We are thrilled to announce the release of Kyverno 1.15.0, continuing our mission to make policy management in Kubernetes environments more modular, performant, and user-friendly. This release introduces new capabilities across multiple policy types, enhances testing and CLI functionality, and brings many improvements that a vibrant community has contributed. New MutatingPolicy for dynamic resource transformation with native Kubernetes integration New GeneratingPolicy for intelligent resource creation and synchronization using CEL expressions New DeletingPolicy resource for controlled cleanup of Kubernetes resources Advanced CEL functions and enhanced policy exception support for fine-grained control Community milestone: over 850 changes merged from 70+ contributors, including many first-timers! Building on the foundation of ValidatingPolicy and ImageValidatingPolicy from previous releases, Kyverno 1.15 introduces three new CEL-based policy types that complete our comprehensive policy ecosystem. While Kyverno, created by Nirmata, maintains its traditional policy engine capabilities, these new policy types provide native Kubernetes integration by automatically converting to Kubernetes admission controllers – MutatingPolicy converts to MutatingAdmissionPolicy (MAP) and ValidatingPolicy converts to ValidatingAdmissionPolicy (VAP). This hybrid approach gives users the flexibility to choose between Kyverno’s rich policy engine features and native Kubernetes performance. The new MutatingPolicy type provides native Kubernetes integration through MutatingAdmissionPolicy, offering: Full support for all functions that a mutate rule of a traditional policy supports Easier for each loop iteration with CEL’s map() and filter() functions Full support of advanced custom CEL libraries for complex policy logic CLI support for offline resources mutation in CI/CD pipelines Here is an example of adding default labels to deployments.

But despite collecting more logs, metrics, and traces than ever before, teams are still struggling to answer the most basic questions during incidents: What broke? Where? And why? In my recent talk at OpenTelemetry Community Day, “ T he Signal in the Storm: Practical Strategies for Managing Telemetry Overload ,” I laid out a different path forward, one focused not on volume, but on meaning. More telemetry doesn’t guarantee more understanding. In many cases, it gives you the illusion of control while silently eroding your ability to reason about the system. That illusion becomes expensive, especially when telemetry pipelines are optimized for ingestion, not insight. Observability Needs a Better Model Traditional observability relies on emitting and aggregating raw signals (spans, logs, and metrics), then querying across that pile post-hoc. That model assumes the data will be useful after something goes wrong. But today’s distributed, dynamic, multi-tenant AI-driven systems don’t give you that luxury. The cost of collecting all raw signals without semantics and without context is too high. We need a shift: from streams of telemetry to structured, semantic representations of how systems behave. That starts by modeling the actual components of the system (entities) and the relationships between them. Not as metadata bolted onto spans, but as first-class signals.</description></item><item><title>Building a Scalable, Flexible, Cloud-Native GenAI Platform with Open Source Solutions</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-08-28-building-a-scalable-flexible-cloud-native-genai-platform-with-open-source-soluti/</link><pubDate>Thu, 28 Aug 2025 23:57:26 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-08-28-building-a-scalable-flexible-cloud-native-genai-platform-with-open-source-soluti/</guid><description>Core Architecture: Two-Tier Gateway Design ​ Tier One Gateway ​ Tier Two Gateway ​ Design Benefits ​ Routing and Traffic Management ​ Self-Hosted Model Serving with KServe ​ Observability, Control, and Optimization for Production Readiness ​ Observability ​ Control ​ Optimization ​ Pluggable and Flexible ​ Summary ​ Posted on August 28, 2025 by Takeshi Yoneda, Envoy Maintainer and Open Source Software Engineer at Tetrate AI workloads are complex, and unmanaged complexity kills velocity. Your architecture is the key to mastering it. As generative AI (GenAI) becomes foundational to modern software products, developers face a chaotic new reality, juggling different APIs from various providers while also attempting to deploy self-hosted open-source models. This leads to credential sprawl, inconsistent security policies, runaway costs, and an infrastructure that is difficult to scale and govern. Your architecture doesn’t have to be this complex. Platform engineering teams need a secure, scalable way to serve both internal and external LLMs to their users. That’s where tools such as Envoy AI Gateway come in. This reference architecture outlines how to build a flexible GenAI platform using the open source solutions Envoy AI Gateway, KServe, and complementary tools. Whether you’re self-hosting models or integrating with model-serving services on cloud providers, such as OpenAI and Anthropic, this architecture enables a unified, governable interface for LLM traffic. The foundation of this platform is a Two-Tier Gateway Architecture: Deployed in a centralized Gateway Cluster. It serves as the main API traffic entry point for client applications.

While a variety of high level tools like Large Language Models (LLMs) already exist to support generic use cases, many domain specific solutions are either not yet available or come with significant development costs and risks, particularly when targeting more niche problems. This raises an important challenge: how can we avoid building a fragmented AI tooling landscape with limited real world applicability? To truly support the next wave of AI innovation, especially in cloud native environments, we need to rethink and reinforce our software component foundation. This includes standardizing formats, improving cross platform interoperability, and evolving Kubernetes with AI native features in mind. One of the most promising developments in this space revolves around Open Container Initiative (OCI) artifacts. OCI artifacts enable users to store and distribute arbitrary files and metadata using OCI compliant container registries. While originally used for generic purposes (like ORAS supports them), they’re now finding critical roles in AI/ML workflows, especially with the rise of specifications like the CNCF ModelPack. The CNCF ModelPack Specification builds on top of OCI artifacts and aims to standardize the packaging, distribution, and execution of AI models in cloud native environments. By moving away from proprietary formats, ModelPack facilitates reproducibility, portability, and vendor neutrality in machine learning workflows. This opens the door to several important use cases: Standardized AI/ML model packaging : With OCI artifacts, models can be versioned, distributed, and tracked like container images. This promotes consistency and traceability across environments. Secure model delivery : Well established solutions like sigstore signatures offer mechanisms to sign and verify OCI artifacts, improving model integrity and trustworthiness.</description></item><item><title>Use Envoy Gateway as the Unified Ingress Gateway and Waypoint Proxy for Ambient Mesh</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-08-26-use-envoy-gateway-as-the-unified-ingress-gateway-and-waypoint-proxy-for-ambient-/</link><pubDate>Tue, 26 Aug 2025 13:09:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-08-26-use-envoy-gateway-as-the-unified-ingress-gateway-and-waypoint-proxy-for-ambient-/</guid><description>Why use Envoy Gateway with Ambient Mesh? How Envoy Gateway Works in Ambient Mesh? Setting Up Envoy Gateway as the Ingress Gateway Enabling Envoy Gateway as the Waypoint Proxy Should You Use Envoy Gateway with Ambient Mesh? What’s Next? References Posted on August 26, 2025 by Huabing (Robin) Zhao, Software Engineer &amp;amp; Ric Hincapié, DevOps and Support Engineer at Tetrate In this article, we’ll look at how you can use Envoy Gateway , an Envoy project open source solution, together with Istio when running in Ambient mode. This allows you to easily leverage the power of Envoy’s L7 capabilities for Ingress and east-west traffic in your mesh with easy-to-use CRDs. To understand how this integration works, let’s first take a quick look at Ambient Mesh itself. Also known as Istio Ambient mode , it’s a sidecar-less service mesh architecture that aims to simplify deployments and can boost efficiency for specific use cases. Unlike sidecar-based meshes, Ambient splits the data plane into two key components: the ztunnel , which secures service-to-service communication, and the Waypoint Proxy , which handles Layer 7 traffic routing and policy enforcement. On the other side, Envoy Gateway is a Kubernetes-native API gateway built on top of Envoy Proxy. It’s designed to work seamlessly with the Kubernetes Gateway API and takes a batteries-included approach—offering built-in support for authentication, authorization, rate limiting, CORS handling, header manipulation, and more. These capabilities are exposed through familiar Kubernetes-style APIs, letting you fully tap into Envoy’s power without needing complex configurations. Because both Ambient Mesh and Envoy Gateway are built on top of Envoy, they share a common foundation. This makes integration straightforward and allows Envoy Gateway to act as both the Ingress Gateway and Waypoint Proxy —giving you a consistent and powerful way to manage traffic and apply Layer 7 policies across your mesh. While Ambient Mesh simplifies service mesh operations by removing sidecars, its feature set doesn’t yet match the maturity of the sidecar-based model. Some advanced Layer 7 capabilities are either missing, considered experimental, or require extra complexity to configure in native Ambient mode.</description></item><item><title>How Should Prometheus Handle OpenTelemetry Resource Attributes? – A UX Research Report</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-08-25-how-should-prometheus-handle-opentelemetry-resource-attributes-a-ux-research-rep/</link><pubDate>Mon, 25 Aug 2025 19:42:02 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-08-25-how-should-prometheus-handle-opentelemetry-resource-attributes-a-ux-research-rep/</guid><description>Project background Research approach User interviews insights Survey insights What I didn’t expect to learn (but did) Recommended solutions Short-term solutions Long-term vision Acknowledgments What’s next for me Posted on August 25, 2025 by Victoria Nduka, User Experience Designer CNCF projects highlighted in this post On May 29th, 2025, I wrapped up my mentorship with Prometheus through the Linux Foundation Mentorship Program. My project focused on understanding how Prometheus handles OpenTelemetry resource attributes and how that experience could be improved for users. My job was to conduct user research to get the user perspective on this challenge. In three months, I conducted user and stakeholder interviews, ran a survey, and analyzed the findings. In this article, I’ll share how I conducted the research, what I uncovered and where the communities involved could go from here. OpenTelemetry (OTel) has something called a resource attribute, which is extra information about the source of a metric, like the service, host, or environment that generated it. Prometheus, a time-series database, uses labels to identify and query metrics. If resource attributes are converted to labels, they can cause what’s known as “a cardinality explosion”, essentially creating too many unique combinations that overwhelm the system. This usually happens if the attributes change often or include a lot of unique values, like user IDs or pod names. Currently, there are three main approaches to handling this challenge: Map all resource attributes to labels: This creates cardinality explosion problems, especially for applications with large numbers of attributes or frequently changing attribute values. Selective promotion: Users manually choose which resource attributes are important enough to be converted to labels in Prometheus. Target info pattern: Put all resource attributes in a separate metric called target_info.</description></item><item><title>How I Team Up with GenAI to Craft Conference Talk Proposals</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-08-22-how-i-team-up-with-genai-to-craft-conference-talk-proposals/</link><pubDate>Fri, 22 Aug 2025 20:09:07 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-08-22-how-i-team-up-with-genai-to-craft-conference-talk-proposals/</guid><description>An Incomplete List of GenAI Tells My Process Step One: Brainstorm Buddy Step Two: Shape the Story Step Three: Write the Abstract Prompt 1: Brainstorm Buddy Prompt 2: Shape the Story Prompt 3: Write the Abstract Enjoy the Result! Before you Submit LMKWYT! References Posted on August 22, 2025 by Whitney Lee, CNCF Ambassador and Senior Technical Advocate at Datadog TL;DR: GenAI can help you write conference abstracts, but if you use it without injecting your own curiosity and humanness, reviewers can tell. This post walks through my personal process for co-writing abstracts with GenAI in a way that preserves my voice and experience. I developed this process for technical talks, but it adapts well to other formats too. I’ve spoken at a lot of conferences, big and small. I’ve given keynotes. Breakouts. Workshops. I’ve been around the block and written many conference talk proposals. I’ve also been on program committees and reviewed others’ proposals. There’s always room for improvement, but I like to think I know what good is. In my view, here are some elements of a good talk proposal: – A clear, engaging idea (or a run-of-the-mill idea with a compelling angle) – Some clear details about the talk, like concrete examples or stories, or talk format and tools covered – Clear audience – Clear takeaways As you can imagine, the widespread use of GenAI to generate talk proposals has changed the game for both submitters and reviewers. As a submitter, you can type just one line into ChatGPT, for example: Write me a KubeCon + CloudNativeCon talk abstract on Validating Admission Policy And it produces something that, on the surface, looks pretty good!* Title: Enforcing What Matters: Building Safer Kubernetes with Validating Admission Policies Abstract: As Kubernetes adoption continues to grow across organizations, ensuring workloads meet security, compliance, and operational standards before hitting the cluster is more critical than ever.</description></item><item><title>Celebrating 100 Golden Kubestronauts</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-08-21-celebrating-100-golden-kubestronauts/</link><pubDate>Thu, 21 Aug 2025 13:59:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-08-21-celebrating-100-golden-kubestronauts/</guid><description>What is a Golden Kubestronaut? Once a Golden, Always a Golden Growing Together as a Community Thank You! Posted on August 21, 2025 by Christophe Sauthier, Cloud Native Training and Certification Lead The Kubestronauts program has been growing at an incredible pace. We recently celebrated over 2000 kubestronauts across the globe, and today we’re excited to celebrate another milestone: over 100 Golden Kubestronauts have achieved Golden status in less than five months, thanks to their dedication and hard work. One of the most inspiring aspects of the Golden Kubestronauts community is its global reach. With more than 100 Golden badges earned so far, we see representation from every corner of the world—spanning North and South America, Europe, Asia, and beyond. From Austria, Brazil, and Canada to India, Japan, and Singapore , and from Germany, the Netherlands, France and the United States to places like Bangladesh, Mongolia, and Vietnam , Golden Kubestronauts truly embody the global spirit of CNCF. This diversity highlights not only the worldwide adoption of cloud native technologies, but also the strength of a community that learns, grows, and achieves together—regardless of geography. Becoming a Golden Kubestronaut is the highest level of recognition in the program. It requires completing all CNCF certifications as well as the Linux Foundation Certified Sysadmin (LFCS). Starting October 15th, the Certified Cloud Native Platform Engineering Associate (CNPA) will also be added as part of this journey—just as all future CNCF certifications will be included as the program continues to evolve. Golden Kubestronauts are proof of what’s possible when passion, knowledge, persistence, and a love of cloud native come together. They embody the breadth of skills across the ecosystem, from Kubernetes administration to observability, security, platform engineering, and more. It’s important to highlight that once you’ve earned Golden Kubestronaut status, it’s yours for life.</description></item><item><title>Uniting the Cloud Native Community at the Inaugural KCD SF Bay Area</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-08-20-uniting-the-cloud-native-community-at-the-inaugural-kcd-sf-bay-area/</link><pubDate>Wed, 20 Aug 2025 14:23:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-08-20-uniting-the-cloud-native-community-at-the-inaugural-kcd-sf-bay-area/</guid><description>Posted on August 20, 2025 by Lisa-Marie Namphy and Matthew Cascio, CNCF Ambassadors The cloud native landscape is constantly evolving, and staying ahead of the curve means more than just reading documentation—it means connecting with the people who are shaping the future.

This matters because while GenAI can generate content, ideas, or responses, it can’t act on them. However, when combined with Agentic AI, your systems shift from being reactive and prompt-driven to autonomous and outcome-oriented. This article aims to help senior technology leaders better understand the value Agentic AI can add to existing AI infrastructure, while outlining key considerations to determine whether its implementation aligns with your business needs. Image caption: Core components of an Agentic AI Architecture from Markovate. Agentic AI systems are designed to operate autonomously, perceiving their environment, making decisions, and executing actions without continuous human oversight. This autonomy enables businesses to streamline operations, reduce costs, and enhance scalability. The image above illustrates how the following systems function: Perception layer: This layer involves collecting data from various sources i. e. sensors, cameras, microphones, and digital inputs, to understand the current state of the environment. For businesses, this means real-time monitoring of operations, customer interactions, and market trends, facilitating proactive decision-making and rapid response to changing conditions. Cognition layer: Once data is collected, the cognition layer processes this information to interpret context, recognise patterns, and determine the best course of action.</description></item><item><title>Gear Up for the 5th Annual KCD Washington DC!</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-08-16-gear-up-for-the-5th-annual-kcd-washington-dc/</link><pubDate>Sat, 16 Aug 2025 13:04:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-08-16-gear-up-for-the-5th-annual-kcd-washington-dc/</guid><description>Posted on August 16, 2025 by Matthew Cascio, CNCF Ambassador and KCD Washington DC Organizer We’re so thrilled to be organizing another year of cloud native community in the Nation’s Capital. Past years have witnessed amazing presentations ranging from core Kubernetes topics to emerging trends in ML/AI, sustainability, virtual clusters and more. This year promises to be even more amazing. Our program is set, and includes two new innovations for our KCD: For the first time, we’re offering a hands-on workshop covering basic and intermediate topics on using Prometheus in your observability practice. The curriculum covers 20-25% of the Linux Foundation’s Prometheus Certified Associate (PCA) course. While this workshop does not lead to certification, and is not a substitute for the PCA course, it will give you a solid working knowledge for getting started and perhaps help you decide if you’d like to pursue certification separately – if you do, you’ll be ahead of the game with this solid foundation. We’re adding a government-focused cybersecurity keynote by our special guest, Ashley Jones, Cybersecurity Advisor for Region III of the Department of Homeland Security, Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA. ) Special Government &amp;amp; Cybersecurity Focus – and free admission for our government employee community members! You won’t want to miss Ashley Jones’ keynote if you’re a cybersecurity professional or involved in government technology in any way. A limited number of free tickets will be available soon for our community members working for federal, state or local government agencies. You can request a free government ticket here: https://forms. gle/aLNfRwpvFn3vQ5Vo8 Plus our regular program is amazing! All of that rests on top of our regular program that includes presentations like: Industry perspective: Scaling Cloud Native: Reaching the Next 10 Million Users by Lin Sun at Solo. io K8s in the Enterprise: From Silos to SIGs: Building Kubernetes Community in the Enterprise by Jason Stryker Inclusivity: Unleash Your Inner Ally: Let’s Make Open Source Radically Welcoming! by Catherine Paganini and Christopher Khanoyan advocate for inclusivity in open source.</description></item></channel></rss>
