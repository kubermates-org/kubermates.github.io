Why Migrate? Fluentd vs. Fluent Bit: What are the Differences Background Performance Routing Telemetry signal focus Custom processing Custom plugins Monitoring How to get started with a Fluentd to Fluent Bit migration Deployment Deployed as an Aggregator / Collector Adding a Telemetry Pipeline Configuration Custom Plugins Custom Processing Logic Migrating Portions at a Time Conclusion Frequently Asked Questions Why migrate from Fluentd to Fluent Bit What are some differences between Fluentd and Fluent Bit? Can Fluentd and Fluent Bit work together? Posted on October 1, 2025 by Anurag Gupta | Fluent Bit Maintainer | Field Architect | Chronosphere CNCF projects highlighted in this post Fluentd was created over 14 years ago and still continues to be one of the most widely deployed technologies for log collection in the enterprise. Fluentd’s distributed plugin architecture and highly permissive licensing made it ideal as part of the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) as a now graduated project. However, enterprises drowning in telemetry data are now requiring solutions that have higher performance, more native support for evolving schemas and formats, and increased flexibility in processing. Enter Fluent Bit. Fluent Bit , while initially growing as a sub-project within the Fluent ecosystem , expanded from Fluentd to support all telemetry types – logs, metrics, and traces. Fluent Bit now is the more popular of the two with over 15 billion deployments and used by Amazon, Google, Oracle and Microsoft to name a few. Fluent Bit also is fully aligned with OpenTelemetry signals, format and protocol, which ensures that users will be able to continue handling telemetry data as it grows and evolves. Among the most frequent questions we get as the maintainers of the projects are: How do we migrate? What should we watch out for? And what business value do we get for migrating? This article aims to answer these questions with examples. We want to help make it an easy decision to migrate from Fluentd to Fluent Bit. Here is a quick list of the reasons users switch from Fluentd to Fluent Bit: Higher performance for the same resources you are already using Full OpenTelemetry support for logs, metrics, and traces as well as Prometheus support for metrics Simpler configuration and routing ability to multiple locations Higher velocity for adding custom processing rules Integrated monitoring to better understand performance and dataflows To understand all the differences between the projects, it is important to understand the background of each project and the era it was built for. With Fluentd, the main language is Ruby and initially designed to help users push data to big data platforms such as Hadoop.</description></item><item><title>Cloud Native Araraquara - Meetup #05</title><link>https://kubermates.org/events/2025-09-30-cloud-native-araraquara-meetup-05/</link><pubDate>Tue, 30 Sep 2025 22:30:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/events/2025-09-30-cloud-native-araraquara-meetup-05/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Vem aí o nosso Meetup #05No dia 30/09, às 19h30, teremos mais um encontro online e gratuito da Cloud Native Araraquara, &amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>4º Encontro Cloud Native Fortaleza - Online</title><link>https://kubermates.org/events/2025-09-30-4-encontro-cloud-native-fortaleza-online/</link><pubDate>Tue, 30 Sep 2025 22:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/events/2025-09-30-4-encontro-cloud-native-fortaleza-online/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;🚀 Vem aí o terceiro encontro da comunidade Cloud Native Fortaleza! 🎉🌊&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Cartografos Community Meeting</title><link>https://kubermates.org/events/2025-09-30-cartografos-community-meeting/</link><pubDate>Tue, 30 Sep 2025 17:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/events/2025-09-30-cartografos-community-meeting/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Bi-weekly community meeting for the Cartografos Working Group.

I recently passed it, and in this post, I want to share: Why I took the exam How I prepared (including all the resources I used) What the experience was like Whether I’d recommend it This isn’t a sales pitch. It’s a real-world guide to help you prepare — and understand whether this certification is right for you. I’ve been working with ArgoCD for over a year now as a senior cloud engineer. I’ve had first-hand experience managing real-world GitOps workflows, and designing deployment strategies using ArgoCD. However, the CAPA exam doesn’t just focus on ArgoCD. It covers four Argo projects : Argo Workflows Argo CD Argo Rollouts Argo Events While I had a solid foundation in GitOps and ArgoCD (which makes up 34% of the exam), I had little to no hands-on experience with Workflows, Rollouts, or Events — and that’s where most of my preparation efforts went. I prepared for the exam over the course of 1 month — with a focused, hands-on approach. Here’s the breakdown of how I studied and what resources I used: As a CNCF Ambassador, I had the opportunity to get the exam for free, and I also opted to purchase the “DevOps and Workflow Management with Argo (LFS256)” training course.</description></item><item><title>Chaos Mesh Development Meeting</title><link>https://kubermates.org/events/2025-09-30-chaos-mesh-development-meeting/</link><pubDate>Tue, 30 Sep 2025 01:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/events/2025-09-30-chaos-mesh-development-meeting/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;This is a biweekly meeting to discuss anything related to the project development.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Cloud Native Shakti: Women Powering Kubernetes</title><link>https://kubermates.org/events/2025-09-29-cloud-native-shakti-women-powering-kubernetes/</link><pubDate>Mon, 29 Sep 2025 14:30:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/events/2025-09-29-cloud-native-shakti-women-powering-kubernetes/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;This Navratri, join us in celebrating the power of women in technology with a special Cloud Native virtual event.

What is new and different this year? What will the day look like? Should I do any homework first? A note from the co-chairs Posted on September 29, 2025 by Co-chairs, Blair Fraser, Bryan Landes, Balaji Sivasubramanian CNCF projects highlighted in this post BackstageCon has been in existence since 2022, where it made its debut at KubeCon + CloudNativeCon North America in Detroit. We want attendees at BackstageCon to leave with a deeper understanding of the latest trends and use cases of Backstage. Last year, Backstage saw strong engagement from the end user community, with significant contributions driving its momentum. We aim to springboard from that success, by bringing together the Backstage community and sharing success stories, use cases, and the future of the Backstage project. The BackstageCon agenda is suitable for all skill levels, but we think that anyone involved in platform engineering, developer portals, or those interested in improving developer productivity will make the most out of this event. For early adopters of Backstage, this event is an excellent opportunity to learn from experienced users and contributors. Experienced Backstage users will find insights into the future of Backstage and can use this event as an excellent opportunity to network with other adopters. This year’s agenda introduces new topics, including how organizations of all sizes are scaling developer productivity using Backstage, the future of developer portals, and scaling AI development. This event will kick off in the main room with a welcome from the chairs. We have a single track agenda starting with an adopter session in scaling developer productivity. Keynote sessions from our sponsors will lead into several exciting sessions on topics from leveraging the new notification system, using scaffolder for workflows, and a panel discussion of the future of developer portals. Our afternoon will include sessions led by contributors and adopters covering topics like standardizing MCP deployment and governance, taming the post-startup stage with Backstage, and how one adopter is turning their insights into golden paths.</description></item><item><title>Running AI Agents on Kubernetes with kagent</title><link>https://kubermates.org/events/2025-09-27-running-ai-agents-on-kubernetes-with-kagent/</link><pubDate>Sat, 27 Sep 2025 09:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/events/2025-09-27-running-ai-agents-on-kubernetes-with-kagent/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Bu etkinlğimizde AI Agent kavramından, son zamanların en popüler konularından birisi olan MCP (Model Context Protocol)&amp;lsquo;den ve Agent to Agent iletişimde kullanılan A2A protokolden ayrıca bir AI Agent&amp;rsquo;ın Kubernetes ortamında kagent yardımıyla nasıl çalıştırılabileceğinden bahsedeceğiz.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Programmers Day 2025</title><link>https://kubermates.org/events/2025-09-27-programmers-day-2025/</link><pubDate>Sat, 27 Sep 2025 06:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/events/2025-09-27-programmers-day-2025/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;The developers community in Mauritius is particularly large and vibrant, spanning multiple sub-categories of the tech wo&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>#cTENcf Birthday Bash X Atlassian X AWS Jaipur</title><link>https://kubermates.org/events/2025-09-27-ctencf-birthday-bash-x-atlassian-x-aws-jaipur/</link><pubDate>Sat, 27 Sep 2025 04:30:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/events/2025-09-27-ctencf-birthday-bash-x-atlassian-x-aws-jaipur/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;#cTENcf regional events are organised by every local community group to celebrate 10 years of CNCF.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CNCG Kochi Sept Offline Meetup</title><link>https://kubermates.org/events/2025-09-27-cncg-kochi-sept-offline-meetup/</link><pubDate>Sat, 27 Sep 2025 04:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/events/2025-09-27-cncg-kochi-sept-offline-meetup/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Join us for the CNCG Kochi September Offline Meetup, The sessions are packed with cloud-native insights from experience&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Helm Templating: Despliegues al Siguiente Nivel</title><link>https://kubermates.org/events/2025-09-27-helm-templating-despliegues-al-siguiente-nivel/</link><pubDate>Sat, 27 Sep 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/events/2025-09-27-helm-templating-despliegues-al-siguiente-nivel/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Helm Templating: Despliegues al Siguiente NivelHelm es el gestor de paquetes oficial de Kubernetes y uno de los proyecto&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>The Cloud Native Sign Language Glossary: A Story of Community and Inclusion</title><link>https://kubermates.org/events/2025-09-26-the-cloud-native-sign-language-glossary-a-story-of-community-and-inclusion/</link><pubDate>Fri, 26 Sep 2025 19:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/events/2025-09-26-the-cloud-native-sign-language-glossary-a-story-of-community-and-inclusion/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;What is Kubernetes in sign language?

Ensuring consistency and data safety requires our project contributors to continuously improve testing methodologies. In this article, we describe how we use advanced simulation testing to uncover subtle bugs, validate the robustness of our releases, and increase our confidence in etcd’s stability. We’ll share our key findings and how they have improved etcd. Many critical software systems depend on etcd to be correct and consistent, most notably as the primary datastore for Kubernetes. After some issues with the v3.5 release, the etcd maintainers developed a new robustness testing framework to better test for correctness under various failure scenarios. To further enhance our testing capabilities, we integrated a deterministic simulation testing platform from Antithesis into our workflow. The platform works by running the entire etcd cluster inside a deterministic hypervisor. This specialized environment gives the testing software complete control over every source of non-determinism, such as network behavior, thread scheduling, and system clocks. This means any bug it discovers can be perfectly and reliably reproduced. Within this simulated environment, the testing methodology shifts away from traditional, scenario-based tests. Instead of writing tests imperatively with strict assertions for one specific outcome, this approach uses declarative, property-based assertions about system behavior.</description></item><item><title>Tu Compañero SRE con IA: Operaciones Inteligentes en Kubernetes con kagent</title><link>https://kubermates.org/events/2025-09-25-tu-compa-ero-sre-con-ia-operaciones-inteligentes-en-kubernetes-con-kagent/</link><pubDate>Thu, 25 Sep 2025 01:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/events/2025-09-25-tu-compa-ero-sre-con-ia-operaciones-inteligentes-en-kubernetes-con-kagent/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;¿Te imaginas tener un compañero SRE que nunca duerme, analiza patrones complejos en segundos y puede ejecutar operacione&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>OTel in Practice: How We Scaled KafkaLog Ingestion for OTel by 150%</title><link>https://kubermates.org/events/2025-09-24-otel-in-practice-how-we-scaled-kafkalog-ingestion-for-otel-by-150/</link><pubDate>Wed, 24 Sep 2025 17:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/events/2025-09-24-otel-in-practice-how-we-scaled-kafkalog-ingestion-for-otel-by-150/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Join us for what&amp;rsquo;s sure to be an insightful session, as Dakota Paasman from Bindplane shares how their team solved a cus&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Cloud Native Live: Kubernetes v1.34 Release</title><link>https://kubermates.org/events/2025-09-24-cloud-native-live-kubernetes-v1-34-release/</link><pubDate>Wed, 24 Sep 2025 16:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/events/2025-09-24-cloud-native-live-kubernetes-v1-34-release/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Similar to previous releases, the release of Kubernetes v1.34 introduces new stable, beta, and alpha features.

These changes, which will take effect by September 29, 2025 , mark a shift to a paid subscription model for Bitnami Secure Images and the removal of many free-to-use artifacts from public registries. We want to be clear: these changes do not impact the Helm project itself. Helm is a graduated project that will remain under the CNCF. It continues to be fully open source, Apache 2.0 licensed, and governed by a neutral community. The CNCF community retains ownership of all project intellectual property per our IP policy , ensuring no single vendor can alter its open governance model. While “Helm charts” refer broadly to a packaging format that anyone can use to deploy applications on Kubernetes, Bitnami Helm Charts are a specific vendor-maintained implementation. Developed and maintained by the Bitnami team (now part of Broadcom), these charts are known for their ease of use, security features, and reliability. Bitnami’s decision to deprecate its public chart and image repositories is entirely separate from the Helm project itself. Users currently depending on Bitnami Helm Charts should begin exploring migration or mirroring strategies to avoid potential disruption. The Helm community is actively working to support users during this transition, including guidance on: Updating chart dependencies Exploring alternative chart sources Migrating to maintained open image repositories We encourage users to follow the Helm blog and Helm GitHub for updates and support resources. CNCF remains committed to maintaining the integrity of our open source projects and supporting communities through transitions like this.</description></item><item><title>Local Roots, Global Reach: CNCJ Reflects on KubeCon + CloudNativeCon Japan 2025</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-09-24-local-roots-global-reach-cncj-reflects-on-kubecon-cloudnativecon-japan-2025/</link><pubDate>Wed, 24 Sep 2025 16:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-09-24-local-roots-global-reach-cncj-reflects-on-kubecon-cloudnativecon-japan-2025/</guid><description>🌏 A Landmark Gathering: KubeCon + CloudNativeCon Comes to Japan 🇯🇵 CNCJ and Japan Community Day Posted on September 24, 2025 by Masaya Aoyama, Sunyanan Choochotkaew (KubeCon+CloudNativeCon Japan 2025 Program Co-Chair, CNCJ Board) CNCF projects highlighted in this post Konnichiwa from Tokyo! 🇯🇵 In June 2025, something remarkable happened: the global cloud native community gathered in Tokyo for the first-ever KubeCon + CloudNativeCon Japan, hosted by the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) under the Linux Foundation. This wasn’t just another tech conference—it was a proud milestone for Japan’s growing open source and cloud native ecosystem. KubeCon + CloudNativeCon Japan 2025 marked the first time the CNCF’s flagship event was held on Japanese soil—bringing together a full house of 1,500 attendees from across Japan and around the world. Hosted at the Hilton Tokyo Odaiba , the event featured over 40 sessions covering the full spectrum of cloud native technologies, ranging from beginner-friendly topics and observability to AI/ML, platform engineering, connectivity, and security. The two days were packed with innovation, collaboration, and connection. Developers, maintainers, end users, and technologists of all stripes came together to share lessons learned, explore emerging trends, and dive deep into the future of open source infrastructure. In addition to technical talks, the conference emphasized community building—celebrating contributors, spotlighting regional efforts, and encouraging diverse perspectives. For many Japanese attendees, it was a rare opportunity to engage with the global cloud native ecosystem right at home. For international guests, it was a chance to experience Japan’s fast-growing tech culture firsthand. While CNCF and the Linux Foundation brought usual professionalism to organizing KubeCon + CloudNativeCon Japan, we at Cloud Native Community Japan (CNCJ) were proud to support the local community layer —bridging global expertise with Japanese voices and initiatives. One of our most successful contributions was organizing Japan Community Day , held on June 15 , just ahead of the main conference. This CNCJ-led event gathered local contributors, meetup organizers, and engineers from across Japan and from overseas.</description></item><item><title>#cTENcf Party - 10 years of CNCF and 5 years of Cloud Native Linz</title><link>https://kubermates.org/events/2025-09-24-ctencf-party-10-years-of-cncf-and-5-years-of-cloud-native-linz/</link><pubDate>Wed, 24 Sep 2025 15:30:22 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/events/2025-09-24-ctencf-party-10-years-of-cncf-and-5-years-of-cloud-native-linz/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;We&amp;rsquo;re happy to announce our next edition of our meetup where we&amp;rsquo;ll celebrate 10 years of CNCF and 5 years of our local c&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>cTENcf celebration!</title><link>https://kubermates.org/events/2025-09-24-ctencf-celebration/</link><pubDate>Wed, 24 Sep 2025 15:30:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/events/2025-09-24-ctencf-celebration/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;CNCF turns 10 and that should be celebrated - So joins us for the celebration of cTENcf and lets reminisce what has happ&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>cTENcf Montreal Party: Celebrating Cloud Native's Journey</title><link>https://kubermates.org/events/2025-09-23-ctencf-montreal-party-celebrating-cloud-native-s-journey/</link><pubDate>Tue, 23 Sep 2025 21:30:29 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/events/2025-09-23-ctencf-montreal-party-celebrating-cloud-native-s-journey/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;📢Call for Speakers is open &lt;a href="https://sessionize.com/cncf-montreal"&gt;https://sessionize.com/cncf-montreal&lt;/a&gt;.📢Join us for an unforgettable evening as we commemorate &amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>#cTENcf Birthday Bash Porto</title><link>https://kubermates.org/events/2025-09-23-ctencf-birthday-bash-porto/</link><pubDate>Tue, 23 Sep 2025 17:30:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/events/2025-09-23-ctencf-birthday-bash-porto/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s celebrate 10 years of CNCF together.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Solving Kubernetes Multi-tenancy Challenges with vCluster</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-09-23-solving-kubernetes-multi-tenancy-challenges-with-vcluster/</link><pubDate>Tue, 23 Sep 2025 16:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-09-23-solving-kubernetes-multi-tenancy-challenges-with-vcluster/</guid><description>Understanding Multi-tenancy Multi-tenancy with native Kubernetes features Control Plane Isolation Data Plane Isolation vCluster Concept Hands-on Prerequisites Deploy a virtual cluster Deploy workload Deploy a CRD Hands-on summary Interaction with host applications Falco Kyverno Implications Summary Outlook References Posted on September 23, 2025 by Fabian Brundke, Senior Platform Engineer, Liquid Reply CNCF projects highlighted in this post When we are building Internal Developer Platforms (IDP) for our customers Kubernetes is often a solid choice as the robust core of this platform. This is due to its technical capabilities and the strong community that is constantly expanding the surrounding ecosystem. One common IDP use case is to support the software development lifecycle (SDLC) of multiple tenants (e. g. multiple applications or software engineering teams). Adopting Kubernetes helps to share resources among these different tenants and while this helps to – among other benefits – optimize costs and enforce standards, it also introduces the challenge of isolating workloads from each other. This is known as multi-tenancy and for an IDP we have to ensure that this isolation is fair and secure. Thankfully Kubernetes provides a few out-of-the-box features to support isolation in a multi-tenant setup. This isolation can happen for the control plane and data plane.

What is new and different this year? What will the day look like? Should I do any homework first? Meet your community! A note from co-chair Bill Mulligan: Posted on September 22, 2025 by Co-chairs: Bill Mulligan and Hemanth Malla CNCF projects highlighted in this post CiliumCon began at KubeCon + CloudNativeCon Europe 2023 in Amsterdam, and this will be our sixth time hosting it. Like Cilium itself, the event has grown significantly since its inception, expanding from its original focus to now include Hubble and Tetragon too. There might even be some nods to scaling networking for the needs of AI. CiliumCon is where the Cilium and eBPF community comes together to share real-world experiences and learn from each other. It’s a space to meet the Github handles you have been working with or following the whole year and who knows, you might even walk away with an eBee. Platform teams will walk away with the knowledge on everything from implementing Cilium Mesh in production environments to advanced DNS policy management to multi-cluster security strategies and running IPv6 only Kubernetes clusters. Seasoned contributors will learn if it’s actually possible to parse DNS in the kernel and everyone will help build the buzz around Cilium. This year, we are celebrating almost 10 years of Cilium! As the project has matured, we’re able to feature the experience of a decade of production implementations. Attendees will hear how CiliumEndpointSlice helped Microsoft unlock higher scale at AKS, SeatGeek’s journey from zero to production in 90 days with Cilium Mesh, ESnet’s pioneering IPv6-first Kubernetes deployment, and Google’s multi-cluster network security strategies with Cilium, Tetragon, and Hubble. We’re also diving deep into kernel-level DNS parsing improvements and will learn how to solve a real-world bug in Cilium’s BPF-based SNAT and its LRU eviction policy. The CIlium and eBPF community will come together for a half-day on Monday, November 10th, from 9:00 AM to 12:30 PM EST. The day will kick off with opening remarks from Program Committee Co-Chairs Bill Mulligan and Hemanth Malla, followed by six technical sessions, and a keynote from Liz Rice which will cover the broader community direction and vision.</description></item><item><title>#cTENcf Birthday Bash Hanoi 🇻🇳</title><link>https://kubermates.org/events/2025-09-21-ctencf-birthday-bash-hanoi/</link><pubDate>Sun, 21 Sep 2025 06:30:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/events/2025-09-21-ctencf-birthday-bash-hanoi/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;🎉 Celebrating 10 Years of CNCF: Join Us for a Special Anniversary Event! 🎉Hãy tham gia cùng chúng tôi trong lễ kỷ niệm đ&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Cloud Native Luanda - Meetup Setembro 2025</title><link>https://kubermates.org/events/2025-09-20-cloud-native-luanda-meetup-setembro-2025/</link><pubDate>Sat, 20 Sep 2025 18:30:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/events/2025-09-20-cloud-native-luanda-meetup-setembro-2025/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Cloud Native Luanda – Meetup Setembro 2025🗓️ Data: 20 de setembro de 2025⏰ Hora: 19h30 (Luanda)🌐 Formato: Evento online🔗&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>KCD El Salvador</title><link>https://kubermates.org/events/2025-09-20-kcd-el-salvador/</link><pubDate>Sat, 20 Sep 2025 13:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/events/2025-09-20-kcd-el-salvador/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Kubernetes Community Days El Salvador 2025 is happening on Saturday, September 20, at the Universidad Centroamericana José Simeón Cañas (UCA) in San Salvador.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>#cTENcf Birthday Bash Lagos</title><link>https://kubermates.org/events/2025-09-20-ctencf-birthday-bash-lagos/</link><pubDate>Sat, 20 Sep 2025 12:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/events/2025-09-20-ctencf-birthday-bash-lagos/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Join us for an exciting meetup as we celebrate 10 years of the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) and its tremendo&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>#cTENcf Meetup Chandigarh</title><link>https://kubermates.org/events/2025-09-20-ctencf-meetup-chandigarh/</link><pubDate>Sat, 20 Sep 2025 05:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/events/2025-09-20-ctencf-meetup-chandigarh/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Celebrating 10 years of CNCF in Tricity.Chandigarh!

Using Event and Audit Logs: Deep System Analysis 8. Using Kubernetes Dashboard and Visual Tools 9. Implementing Health Checks and Probes 10. Advanced Debugging Techniques Practical Example: Network Issue Investigation Conclusion Posted on September 19, 2025 by Keval Bhogayata, Principal Engineer at Middleware In Part 1 of our series, we explored essential Kubernetes troubleshooting techniques that help DevOps engineers diagnose and resolve common cluster and application issues effectively. However, Kubernetes environments are complex, and there’s always more to uncover. In this Part 2, we’ll dive deeper into additional troubleshooting strategies, covering advanced techniques and real-world scenarios that can save you time and prevent downtime. Whether you’re dealing with persistent pod failures, network issues, or cluster misconfigurations, these tips will equip you with the knowledge to tackle Kubernetes challenges with confidence. The PersistentVolumeClaim (PVC) Pending status is a common storage issue in Kubernetes, preventing applications from accessing persistent data. This typically results from misconfigured storage classes, missing volume provisioners, or insufficient available storage in the cluster. Start by listing all Persistent Volumes (PVs) and Persistent Volume Claims (PVCs) across all namespaces. This command provides an overview of their status, access modes, capacity, and whether they are bound: kubectl get pv,pvc &amp;ndash;all-namespaces kubectl get pv,pvc &amp;ndash;all-namespaces To further investigate an unbound PVC stuck in the Pending state, use the following command: kubectl describe pvc kubectl describe pvc Check the Events section at the bottom of the output.</description></item><item><title>KubeCon + CloudNativeCon North America 2024 Co-Located Event Deep Dive: Observability Day</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-09-19-kubecon-cloudnativecon-north-america-2024-co-located-event-deep-dive-observabili/</link><pubDate>Fri, 19 Sep 2025 13:22:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-09-19-kubecon-cloudnativecon-north-america-2024-co-located-event-deep-dive-observabili/</guid><description>What do you want attendees to get out of this event? What is new and different this year? What will the day look like? Should I do any homework first? Meet your community! Posted on September 19, 2025 by Co-chairs: Eduardo Silva, Austin Parker and Juraci Paixão Kröhling Observability Day traces its roots back to KubeCon Europe 2022 in Valencia, where we hosted FluentCon, a co-located event dedicated exclusively to the Fluentd and Fluent Bit projects. The gathering was a success, and the feedback we received from the community made it clear that we could serve the broader observability space at KubeCon in an even bigger way. To make that happen, we expanded our focus and invited other CNCF projects to join. Just a few months later, at KubeCon US 2022, we introduced Open Observability Day, bringing together maintainers and community members from projects such as Jaeger, Fluentd, Thanos, Prometheus, and OpenTelemetry. The response was overwhelmingly positive, and it quickly became clear that this effort needed to evolve into something more formal and structured. Working closely with the CNCF, that vision became reality—and Observability Day was officially born We want attendees to know that Observability Day is a community-driven gathering where practitioners, end users, and project maintainers come together to shape the future of observability. It’s not just about one tool or project, it’s about learning from each other, sharing best practices, and exploring how the CNCF ecosystem works together to solve real-world challenges. Whether you’re new to observability or deeply involved in projects like Prometheus, Fluent Bit, Jaeger, Thanos, or OpenTelemetry, you’ll leave with practical insights, valuable connections, and a clearer picture of where the space is heading. Most importantly, this is your chance to directly engage with the people building the tools you use every day. What’s new this year is the breadth and depth of community-driven content. Observability Day 2025 puts CNCF projects front and center, with maintainers and practitioners sharing the latest updates and lessons learned. You’ll find talks that go beyond theory—covering real-world scaling challenges, cost-efficient monitoring strategies, and new frontiers like AI observability There’s also a stronger emphasis on OpenTelemetry in action, from rapid adoption patterns to advanced use cases in telco, mobile, and enterprise systems.</description></item><item><title>2025: Lo que nos espera en KCD El Salvador - Spoilers y Q&amp;A</title><link>https://kubermates.org/events/2025-09-19-2025-lo-que-nos-espera-en-kcd-el-salvador-spoilers-y-q-a/</link><pubDate>Fri, 19 Sep 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/events/2025-09-19-2025-lo-que-nos-espera-en-kcd-el-salvador-spoilers-y-q-a/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Únase a nosotros para un evento virtual exclusivo donde exploraremos las emocionantes expectativas para KCD El Salvador &amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Cloud Native PDX: Kubernetes, Containerization &amp; Operators</title><link>https://kubermates.org/events/2025-09-19-cloud-native-pdx-kubernetes-containerization-operators/</link><pubDate>Fri, 19 Sep 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/events/2025-09-19-cloud-native-pdx-kubernetes-containerization-operators/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Come out and join us to network with local cloud native peers.Agenda:5:00pm to 5:30pm – Pizza and Networking!

What is new with Kyverno this year? What will the day look like? Should I do any homework first? Find your community! A special note from the chairs : Posted on September 15, 2025 by Co-chairs: Jim Bugwadia &amp;amp; Cortney Nickerson CNCF projects highlighted in this post This is the very first KyvernoCon ! While Kyverno has been part of the CNCF since November 2020, and has had a strong presence at past KubeCon events through policy as code focused talks, maintainer sessions, and community meetups, this is the first time our community is gathering under one roof for a dedicated event. Kubernetes has become the standard for cloud native and AI/ML workloads, and large organizations need to automate security and compliance. Hence, there is a critical need and growing awareness for policy as code. Over the past few years, Kyverno has matured significantly, becoming the most widely adopted CNCF policy engine. As we work towards becoming a graduated project and are continuing to incorporate new capabilities like CEL-based policies and a growing set of integrations across the ecosystem, the timing felt right to create a space where users, contributors, and platform teams can learn, share, and shape the future of policy as code together. KyvernoCon is designed for anyone building or running Kubernetes platforms, but especially valuable for: Organizations running Kubernetes at scale and for mission critical software, who are looking for unified governance across clusters, pipelines, and cloud. Platform engineers and SREs who want to leverage policy as code into day-to-day workflows for automated and secure delivery practices, cost savings, and a better overall developer experience. Security and compliance teams looking for practical ways to enforce standards and reduce risk. Developers and operators who want to understand how policy can improve reliability and speed. Adopters, contributors, and open-source enthusiasts eager to collaborate and shape Kyverno’s next chapter. Leaders and decision-makers curious about why policy as code has become a must-have in modern platform engineering and software delivery. If you touch Kubernetes in any way and care about doing it securely, sustainably, and at scale, you’ll get value out of spending the day with us.</description></item><item><title>CKA Bootcamp by CNCG Gandhinagar - Week 2</title><link>https://kubermates.org/events/2025-09-13-cka-bootcamp-by-cncg-gandhinagar-week-2/</link><pubDate>Sat, 13 Sep 2025 12:30:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/events/2025-09-13-cka-bootcamp-by-cncg-gandhinagar-week-2/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;🚀 CKA Bootcamp – Master Kubernetes with Hands-On LearningGet ready to take your Kubernetes skills to the next level!Foll&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>#cTENcf Birthday Bash Lagos</title><link>https://kubermates.org/events/2025-09-13-ctencf-birthday-bash-lagos/</link><pubDate>Sat, 13 Sep 2025 12:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/events/2025-09-13-ctencf-birthday-bash-lagos/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Join us for an exciting meetup as we celebrate 10 years of the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) and its tremendo&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>VS CODE DEVS DAY MINNA</title><link>https://kubermates.org/events/2025-09-13-vs-code-devs-day-minna/</link><pubDate>Sat, 13 Sep 2025 09:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/events/2025-09-13-vs-code-devs-day-minna/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Learn from community and Expert-led talks on the latest in VS Code🛠️ Build real-world projects in a hands-on workshop session🤝 Connect with fellow developers, educators, and innovators in your city🎁 Grab exclusive VS Code swag (first-come, first-served)&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Cloud Native Calicut Meetup</title><link>https://kubermates.org/events/2025-09-13-cloud-native-calicut-meetup/</link><pubDate>Sat, 13 Sep 2025 04:30:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/events/2025-09-13-cloud-native-calicut-meetup/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Join us for the second edition of the Cloud Native Calicut Meetup — a casual yet enriching gathering of cloud enthusiast&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CNCG Kottayam Sep Online Meetup</title><link>https://kubermates.org/events/2025-09-13-cncg-kottayam-sep-online-meetup/</link><pubDate>Sat, 13 Sep 2025 04:30:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/events/2025-09-13-cncg-kottayam-sep-online-meetup/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Join us for yet another exciting event of learning &amp;amp; collaboration.

Diagnosing Service and Networking Problems: The Pending Error 5. Kubernetes Troubleshooting High Resource Usage: Solving OOMKilled Errors Using Monitoring and Tracing Tools Posted on September 12, 2025 by Keval Bhogayata, Principal Engineer at Middleware Member post originally published on the Middleware blog by Keval Bhogayata , covering the top 10 Kubernetes Troubleshooting Techniques. Regardless of its popularity, there can be times where even the most seasoned DevOps engineers must troubleshoot Kubernetes. While it excels at handling containerised applications at scale, it can present unique troubleshooting challenges. In this post, we’ll explore the top 10 Kubernetes troubleshooting techniques that every DevOps engineer should master. These K8s troubleshooting tips come from real-world scenarios, showing how to solve common and critical Kubernetes issues quickly and reliably. One of the most common and frustrating issues in Kubernetes is when a pod repeatedly crashes during restarts; a situation known as the CrashLoopBackOff error. This occurs when a container fails to start correctly, and Kubernetes continually attempts to restart it, resulting in a loop of failures.&lt;/li&gt;

What is new and different this year? What will the day look like? Should I do any homework first? Thanks to the community! Posted on September 12, 2025 by Chair: Sebastian Stadil CNCF projects highlighted in this post OpenTofu Day is the best place to connect with the OpenTofu community. It’s a fantastic place to talk shop with other infrastructure or platform engineers, trade stories, discuss best practices, and maybe even hire / be hired. OpenTofu is the open source continuation of Hashicorp® Terraform™. The very first of these events was in 2024 at KubeCon in Paris. It was an incredible place to start! The OpenTofu Day schedule is built around the assumption that the audience has prior experience with OpenTofu, Terraform, or other infrastructure as code. Having this experience is not required to attend, but it will definitely help to get the most out of the event. As such, it is best for DevOps engineers, platform engineers, and infrastructure leadership, especially for those looking to migrate from Terraform in 2026. This year we focus less on what it took to get the project off the ground, and more on what is in store for the community, and sharing community experiences with the project in production. The event kicks off with a summary of the progress of the project, new features, growth, and new additions to the core team. Then we have the devs expand on that with a live panel, followed by community members sharing their experiences and learned lessons with the project.

What is new and different this year? What will the day look like? Should I do any homework first? Find your community! Posted on September 9, 2025 by Co-chairs: Fatih Degirmenci &amp;amp; Denis Jannot CNCF projects highlighted in this post November 10, 2025 Atlanta, Georgia Istio Day is the biannual community event for the industry’s most widely adopted and feature rich service mesh, where attendees will find lessons learned from running Istio in production, the latest updates on Istio’s ambient mode developments, and the opportunity to meet and learn from maintainers across the Istio ecosystem. This will be the fourth Istio Day. The first Istio Day was co-located with KubeCon Europe 2023, in Amsterdam. This colocated event replaces ServiceMeshCon, which was first held in 2019, before Istio was a CNCF project. Everyone from newcomers to seasoned professionals will benefit from this event. Whether you’re just starting with Istio or have extensive experience, you’ll gain new insights, discover emerging trends, and have the opportunity to engage directly with industry experts and fellow practitioners. This year, we’ve curated a selection of topics that provide fresh and diverse perspectives on Istio. The event features new voices, emerging technologies, and real-world use cases that reflect the latest industry trends, offering attendees valuable insights they won’t find elsewhere. The event will begin with a welcome from the chairs, followed by a series of technical sessions covering various aspects of Istio, including case studies, new features, and practical recipes. Throughout the event, there will be dedicated breaks for coffee and networking, giving attendees the chance to connect with speakers and fellow practitioners. The event will conclude with closing remarks summarizing key takeaways. Attendees are encouraged to familiarize themselves with the basics of Istio and review the schedule to identify sessions of interest.</description></item><item><title>CloudCon Sydney</title><link>https://kubermates.org/events/2025-09-08-cloudcon-sydney/</link><pubDate>Mon, 08 Sep 2025 22:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/events/2025-09-08-cloudcon-sydney/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Don’t miss CloudCon Sydney – happening 9/10 September 2025!

But with this growth comes an urgent need to prioritise cybersecurity because ignoring security risks in an AI-driven landscape can leave businesses vulnerable to sophisticated threats. Cybersecurity isn’t about relying on a single tool but rather building layered defences. A strategic combination of firewalls, encryption, and advanced threat detection systems can significantly reduce cyber risks while ensuring your organisation runs smoothly. When security is effectively managed, uncertainty is reduced, and your organisation can operate with confidence, allowing you to focus on what truly matters: scaling your business, driving innovation, and staying ahead of the competition. This article explores key cybersecurity tools and how they work together to build a robust security strategy. Whether you’re looking to enhance your existing defences or implement new solutions, these insights will help you strengthen your organisation’s security posture. Cybersecurity is no longer just an IT concern, but rather a boardroom priority. With AI-driven cyber threats no longer limited to generic phishing emails or outdated malware, today’s attacks are smarter, more precise, and alarmingly convincing. In 2023, Darktrace reported a staggering 135% increase in social engineering attacks. These aren’t just your average phishing attempts – they’re highly targeted, AI-generated, and built to exploit human trust. Tools like wormGPT and FraudGPT are being used by attackers to create realistic, personalised, and highly deceptive campaigns that can slip past traditional security filters.</description></item><item><title>[Online] Women in Cloud Era @ Cloud Native Kuala Lumpur Meetup - September 2025</title><link>https://kubermates.org/events/2025-09-08-online-women-in-cloud-era-cloud-native-kuala-lumpur-meetup-september-2025/</link><pubDate>Mon, 08 Sep 2025 11:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/events/2025-09-08-online-women-in-cloud-era-cloud-native-kuala-lumpur-meetup-september-2025/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;[Online] Women in Cloud Era @ Cloud Native Kuala Lumpur Meetup - September 2025&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>#cTENcf Birthday Bash Hanoi 🇻🇳</title><link>https://kubermates.org/events/2025-09-07-ctencf-birthday-bash-hanoi/</link><pubDate>Sun, 07 Sep 2025 06:30:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/events/2025-09-07-ctencf-birthday-bash-hanoi/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;🎉 Celebrating 10 Years of CNCF: Join Us for a Special Anniversary Event! 🎉Hãy tham gia cùng chúng tôi trong lễ kỷ niệm đ&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>cTENcf Party Meetup: CNCF @10 with CNCG Gandhinagar × CNCG Ahmedabad</title><link>https://kubermates.org/events/2025-09-06-ctencf-party-meetup-cncf-10-with-cncg-gandhinagar-cncg-ahmedabad/</link><pubDate>Sat, 06 Sep 2025 04:30:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/events/2025-09-06-ctencf-party-meetup-cncf-10-with-cncg-gandhinagar-cncg-ahmedabad/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;SAVE THE DATE!&lt;/p&gt;

It’s a tried-and-tested solution for managing containerized workloads, but AI workloads are a different beast. Here’s a rundown of what you should think about—and which tools can help—when running AI workloads in cloud-native environments. GenAI Workloads Need Event-Driven Infrastructure GenAI features often hinge on user prompts, streaming data, or background jobs. That means you need infrastructure that’s reactive, scalable, and lean. Knative Serving : Great for HTTP-based GenAI services (like LLM APIs). It automatically scales up when requests come in, and scales to zero when they don’t. Perfect for saving money on GPU-bound workloads. KEDA : Adds event-driven autoscaling based on external sources like Kafka, RabbitMQ, or Prometheus. It complements Knative by widening the scope of what can trigger scaling. Together, they give you a nimble setup that reacts fast and keeps infra costs manageable. Things to consider when serving LLMs in Cloud-Native Environments Cloud-native tooling provides robust building blocks to tackle the considerations below.</description></item><item><title>Infrastructure as Code (IaC): One of the Key Pillars of DevOps Process Automation</title><link>https://kubermates.org/events/2025-09-05-infrastructure-as-code-iac-one-of-the-key-pillars-of-devops-process-automation/</link><pubDate>Fri, 05 Sep 2025 13:30:43 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/events/2025-09-05-infrastructure-as-code-iac-one-of-the-key-pillars-of-devops-process-automation/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Infrastructure as Code (IaC) is one of the key pillars of DevOps process automation, enabling teams to define and manage&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CNCJ: コーディングエージェント × セキュリティ ミートアップ</title><link>https://kubermates.org/events/2025-09-05-cncj/</link><pubDate>Fri, 05 Sep 2025 09:30:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/events/2025-09-05-cncj/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;コーディングエージェントのセキュリティに焦点を当てたミートアップを開催します。&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Alvin Estrada: La historia detrás del hombre.</title><link>https://kubermates.org/events/2025-09-05-alvin-estrada-la-historia-detr-s-del-hombre/</link><pubDate>Fri, 05 Sep 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/events/2025-09-05-alvin-estrada-la-historia-detr-s-del-hombre/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Únete a nosotros en un encuentro especial con Alvin Estrada, un líder destacado en el ámbito de Cloud Native y community&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Conversatorio: Open Source, Docker y Cloud Native con la comunidad: Q&amp;A, oportunidades y crecimiento profesional y personal</title><link>https://kubermates.org/events/2025-09-04-conversatorio-open-source-docker-y-cloud-native-con-la-comunidad-q-a-oportunidad/</link><pubDate>Thu, 04 Sep 2025 23:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/events/2025-09-04-conversatorio-open-source-docker-y-cloud-native-con-la-comunidad-q-a-oportunidad/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Descubrirás las oportunidades que ofrecen el Open Source y el ecosistema Cloud Native para impulsar tu desarrollo profesional; además, abordaremos la importancia de las habilidades blandas, el equilibrio entre vida y trabajo y el crecimiento personal, en una experiencia pensada para aprender, inspir&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Argo CD Up and Running: Multi-Tenancy</title><link>https://kubermates.org/events/2025-09-04-argo-cd-up-and-running-multi-tenancy/</link><pubDate>Thu, 04 Sep 2025 16:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/events/2025-09-04-argo-cd-up-and-running-multi-tenancy/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Join us for an engaging session as we delve into &amp;lsquo;Argo CD: Up and Running&amp;rsquo; by Christian Hernandez and Andrew Block.

The same week, another team spent an entire night hunting phantom load balancer bugs when a certificate rotation had broken mobile clients with certificate pinning. These aren’t stories about incompetent engineers. These are stories about brilliant people falling into the same cognitive trap that catches everyone: diving deep instead of looking broad. Here’s what happened with the kubectl disaster. The symptoms looked serious: cron jobs failing, secrets not updating across namespaces, image pulls crashing left and right.

But what about the underlying nodes themselves, the very foundation on which our workloads run? The attack surface that Kubernetes nodes expose is vast and, if left unprotected, can become a golden ticket for malicious actors. Cilium host firewall is built to lock down the host network namespace with precision, visibility, and control, extending the same familiar declarative Kubernetes network policy model to the underlying host. In this blog post, we’ll explore what Cilium Host Firewall is, how it works, and why it should be a core part of your Kubernetes security. Kubernetes native network policies don’t apply to host-level traffic. This means any communication that enters or leaves the host directly (for example, SSH, kubelet, or external monitoring agents) is largely invisible to traditional Kubernetes policy enforcement. While some firewalling is possible via firewalld or external systems, managing those rules is brittle and lacks integration with Kubernetes. At its core, this is the problem Cilium Host Firewall solves. Leveraging eBPF, Cilium introduces host firewalling directly into the fabric of the cluster. Cilium treats the node as a special type of endpoint with the label reserved:host. This lets us apply policies just like we would for pods, except these apply to traffic to and from the node(s) themselves. Cilium host firewall operates at the interface level.</description></item><item><title>Fall Kickoff at UW-Madison</title><link>https://kubermates.org/events/2025-09-02-fall-kickoff-at-uw-madison/</link><pubDate>Tue, 02 Sep 2025 22:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/events/2025-09-02-fall-kickoff-at-uw-madison/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Big congrats to UW–Madison for being named to LinkedIn’s inaugural Top Colleges list for long-term career success—perfec&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Beyond Terraform Modules: Infrastructure Design by Contract</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-09-02-beyond-terraform-modules-infrastructure-design-by-contract/</link><pubDate>Tue, 02 Sep 2025 17:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-09-02-beyond-terraform-modules-infrastructure-design-by-contract/</guid><description>The Hidden Tax of Module Stitching Four Pillars of Infrastructure Design by Contract 1.

You’re staring at a failed deployment pipeline, trying to figure out why your EKS cluster can’t find the right subnets. You’ve checked the variables, verified the outputs, and triple-checked your depends_on statements. Everything looks correct, yet it still fails. This scenario plays out daily across organizations that have adopted Terraform. While modules promised composable, reusable infrastructure, the reality has become a complex web of string-matching, implicit dependencies, and tribal knowledge. How much of your team’s time is spent debugging module connections rather than delivering value? Every time a team provisions infrastructure for a new service or application, they pay an invisible tax in cognitive overhead: For each input a module needs, someone must make critical decisions: Is this value a hard-coded constant? A data lookup? An output from another module? The answer differs for every project and environment, so this decision tree must be rebuilt from scratch each time.</description></item><item><title>Cartografos Community Meeting</title><link>https://kubermates.org/events/2025-09-02-cartografos-community-meeting/</link><pubDate>Tue, 02 Sep 2025 17:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/events/2025-09-02-cartografos-community-meeting/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Bi-weekly community meeting for the Cartografos Working Group.

Half a decade ago, we celebrated Jaeger’s fifth anniversary , marveling at its growth from a nascent idea to a critical component in the observability stack. Today, as we mark 10 years, we’re not just celebrating longevity; we’re celebrating a profound evolution. Jaeger has been reborn, embracing a future built on collaboration, standardization, and the incredible momentum of OpenTelemetry. For years, the most significant barrier to adopting distributed tracing wasn’t the backend. It was instrumentation. Getting telemetry data out of applications was a complex, often proprietary, and labor-intensive process. Every tracing system had its own SDKs, its own agents, and its own way of doing things. This fragmentation created vendor lock-in and a steep learning curve, hindering widespread adoption. This is where OpenTelemetry changed everything. It didn’t just offer another SDK; it advanced the entire practice of instrumentation. By providing a single, vendor-neutral standard, OpenTelemetry unified both manual instrumentation (SDKs) and automatic instrumentation (agents).</description></item><item><title>Unlocking Platform Engineering for Organizational Success and The Journey to the Beginning of the Edge with Talos Kubernetes</title><link>https://kubermates.org/events/2025-09-01-unlocking-platform-engineering-for-organizational-success-and-the-journey-to-the/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Sep 2025 14:30:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/events/2025-09-01-unlocking-platform-engineering-for-organizational-success-and-the-journey-to-the/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Join us for an exciting evening where we dive into two transformative topics:First, discover the world of Team Topologie&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>#cTENcf Birthday Bash Ranchi</title><link>https://kubermates.org/events/2025-08-31-ctencf-birthday-bash-ranchi/</link><pubDate>Sun, 31 Aug 2025 13:30:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/events/2025-08-31-ctencf-birthday-bash-ranchi/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Celebrating the 10th year of CNCF Communities and the CNCF LandscapeThis edition is extra special — we’re celebrating 10&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>#cTENcf party - USAC - 10 años de CNCF</title><link>https://kubermates.org/events/2025-08-30-ctencf-party-usac-10-a-os-de-cncf/</link><pubDate>Sat, 30 Aug 2025 17:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/events/2025-08-30-ctencf-party-usac-10-a-os-de-cncf/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Celebrate 10 years of CNCF!, Nuestra comunidad esta celebrando los 10 años de CNCF, 10 años, 200 proyectos y más de 275000 contribuidores, únete a nosotros en la USAC para celebrar juntos.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Announcing Kyverno Release 1.15!</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-08-30-announcing-kyverno-release-1-15/</link><pubDate>Sat, 30 Aug 2025 13:31:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-08-30-announcing-kyverno-release-1-15/</guid><description>TL;DR New Policy Types MutatingPolicy: Flexible Resource Transformation GeneratingPolicy: Intelligent Resource Creation DeletingPolicy: Controlled Cleanup Made Easy Pod Security Standard(PSS) Policy Performance: ClusterPolicy vs ValidatingPolicy Key Performance Improvements Why It Matters New OpenReports API Group Support Community &amp;amp; Contributions Getting Started What’s Next? Conclusion Posted on August 30, 2025 by The Kyverno Team CNCF projects highlighted in this post Kyverno 1.15 makes Kubernetes policy management more powerful, extensible, and user-friendly. We are thrilled to announce the release of Kyverno 1.15.0, continuing our mission to make policy management in Kubernetes environments more modular, performant, and user-friendly. This release introduces new capabilities across multiple policy types, enhances testing and CLI functionality, and brings many improvements that a vibrant community has contributed. New MutatingPolicy for dynamic resource transformation with native Kubernetes integration New GeneratingPolicy for intelligent resource creation and synchronization using CEL expressions New DeletingPolicy resource for controlled cleanup of Kubernetes resources Advanced CEL functions and enhanced policy exception support for fine-grained control Community milestone: over 850 changes merged from 70+ contributors, including many first-timers! Building on the foundation of ValidatingPolicy and ImageValidatingPolicy from previous releases, Kyverno 1.15 introduces three new CEL-based policy types that complete our comprehensive policy ecosystem. While Kyverno, created by Nirmata, maintains its traditional policy engine capabilities, these new policy types provide native Kubernetes integration by automatically converting to Kubernetes admission controllers – MutatingPolicy converts to MutatingAdmissionPolicy (MAP) and ValidatingPolicy converts to ValidatingAdmissionPolicy (VAP). This hybrid approach gives users the flexibility to choose between Kyverno’s rich policy engine features and native Kubernetes performance. The new MutatingPolicy type provides native Kubernetes integration through MutatingAdmissionPolicy, offering: Full support for all functions that a mutate rule of a traditional policy supports Easier for each loop iteration with CEL’s map() and filter() functions Full support of advanced custom CEL libraries for complex policy logic CLI support for offline resources mutation in CI/CD pipelines Here is an example of adding default labels to deployments.

But despite collecting more logs, metrics, and traces than ever before, teams are still struggling to answer the most basic questions during incidents: What broke? Where? And why? In my recent talk at OpenTelemetry Community Day, “ T he Signal in the Storm: Practical Strategies for Managing Telemetry Overload ,” I laid out a different path forward, one focused not on volume, but on meaning. More telemetry doesn’t guarantee more understanding. In many cases, it gives you the illusion of control while silently eroding your ability to reason about the system. That illusion becomes expensive, especially when telemetry pipelines are optimized for ingestion, not insight. Observability Needs a Better Model Traditional observability relies on emitting and aggregating raw signals (spans, logs, and metrics), then querying across that pile post-hoc. That model assumes the data will be useful after something goes wrong. But today’s distributed, dynamic, multi-tenant AI-driven systems don’t give you that luxury. The cost of collecting all raw signals without semantics and without context is too high. We need a shift: from streams of telemetry to structured, semantic representations of how systems behave. That starts by modeling the actual components of the system (entities) and the relationships between them. Not as metadata bolted onto spans, but as first-class signals.</description></item><item><title>Building a Scalable, Flexible, Cloud-Native GenAI Platform with Open Source Solutions</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-08-28-building-a-scalable-flexible-cloud-native-genai-platform-with-open-source-soluti/</link><pubDate>Thu, 28 Aug 2025 23:57:26 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-08-28-building-a-scalable-flexible-cloud-native-genai-platform-with-open-source-soluti/</guid><description>Core Architecture: Two-Tier Gateway Design ​ Tier One Gateway ​ Tier Two Gateway ​ Design Benefits ​ Routing and Traffic Management ​ Self-Hosted Model Serving with KServe ​ Observability, Control, and Optimization for Production Readiness ​ Observability ​ Control ​ Optimization ​ Pluggable and Flexible ​ Summary ​ Posted on August 28, 2025 by Takeshi Yoneda, Envoy Maintainer and Open Source Software Engineer at Tetrate AI workloads are complex, and unmanaged complexity kills velocity. Your architecture is the key to mastering it. As generative AI (GenAI) becomes foundational to modern software products, developers face a chaotic new reality, juggling different APIs from various providers while also attempting to deploy self-hosted open-source models. This leads to credential sprawl, inconsistent security policies, runaway costs, and an infrastructure that is difficult to scale and govern. Your architecture doesn’t have to be this complex. Platform engineering teams need a secure, scalable way to serve both internal and external LLMs to their users. That’s where tools such as Envoy AI Gateway come in. This reference architecture outlines how to build a flexible GenAI platform using the open source solutions Envoy AI Gateway, KServe, and complementary tools. Whether you’re self-hosting models or integrating with model-serving services on cloud providers, such as OpenAI and Anthropic, this architecture enables a unified, governable interface for LLM traffic. The foundation of this platform is a Two-Tier Gateway Architecture: Deployed in a centralized Gateway Cluster. It serves as the main API traffic entry point for client applications.

While a variety of high level tools like Large Language Models (LLMs) already exist to support generic use cases, many domain specific solutions are either not yet available or come with significant development costs and risks, particularly when targeting more niche problems. This raises an important challenge: how can we avoid building a fragmented AI tooling landscape with limited real world applicability? To truly support the next wave of AI innovation, especially in cloud native environments, we need to rethink and reinforce our software component foundation. This includes standardizing formats, improving cross platform interoperability, and evolving Kubernetes with AI native features in mind. One of the most promising developments in this space revolves around Open Container Initiative (OCI) artifacts. OCI artifacts enable users to store and distribute arbitrary files and metadata using OCI compliant container registries. While originally used for generic purposes (like ORAS supports them), they’re now finding critical roles in AI/ML workflows, especially with the rise of specifications like the CNCF ModelPack. The CNCF ModelPack Specification builds on top of OCI artifacts and aims to standardize the packaging, distribution, and execution of AI models in cloud native environments. By moving away from proprietary formats, ModelPack facilitates reproducibility, portability, and vendor neutrality in machine learning workflows. This opens the door to several important use cases: Standardized AI/ML model packaging : With OCI artifacts, models can be versioned, distributed, and tracked like container images. This promotes consistency and traceability across environments. Secure model delivery : Well established solutions like sigstore signatures offer mechanisms to sign and verify OCI artifacts, improving model integrity and trustworthiness.</description></item><item><title>Use Envoy Gateway as the Unified Ingress Gateway and Waypoint Proxy for Ambient Mesh</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-08-26-use-envoy-gateway-as-the-unified-ingress-gateway-and-waypoint-proxy-for-ambient-/</link><pubDate>Tue, 26 Aug 2025 13:09:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-08-26-use-envoy-gateway-as-the-unified-ingress-gateway-and-waypoint-proxy-for-ambient-/</guid><description>Why use Envoy Gateway with Ambient Mesh? How Envoy Gateway Works in Ambient Mesh? Setting Up Envoy Gateway as the Ingress Gateway Enabling Envoy Gateway as the Waypoint Proxy Should You Use Envoy Gateway with Ambient Mesh? What’s Next? References Posted on August 26, 2025 by Huabing (Robin) Zhao, Software Engineer &amp;amp; Ric Hincapié, DevOps and Support Engineer at Tetrate In this article, we’ll look at how you can use Envoy Gateway , an Envoy project open source solution, together with Istio when running in Ambient mode. This allows you to easily leverage the power of Envoy’s L7 capabilities for Ingress and east-west traffic in your mesh with easy-to-use CRDs. To understand how this integration works, let’s first take a quick look at Ambient Mesh itself. Also known as Istio Ambient mode , it’s a sidecar-less service mesh architecture that aims to simplify deployments and can boost efficiency for specific use cases. Unlike sidecar-based meshes, Ambient splits the data plane into two key components: the ztunnel , which secures service-to-service communication, and the Waypoint Proxy , which handles Layer 7 traffic routing and policy enforcement. On the other side, Envoy Gateway is a Kubernetes-native API gateway built on top of Envoy Proxy. It’s designed to work seamlessly with the Kubernetes Gateway API and takes a batteries-included approach—offering built-in support for authentication, authorization, rate limiting, CORS handling, header manipulation, and more. These capabilities are exposed through familiar Kubernetes-style APIs, letting you fully tap into Envoy’s power without needing complex configurations. Because both Ambient Mesh and Envoy Gateway are built on top of Envoy, they share a common foundation. This makes integration straightforward and allows Envoy Gateway to act as both the Ingress Gateway and Waypoint Proxy —giving you a consistent and powerful way to manage traffic and apply Layer 7 policies across your mesh. While Ambient Mesh simplifies service mesh operations by removing sidecars, its feature set doesn’t yet match the maturity of the sidecar-based model. Some advanced Layer 7 capabilities are either missing, considered experimental, or require extra complexity to configure in native Ambient mode.</description></item><item><title>How Should Prometheus Handle OpenTelemetry Resource Attributes? – A UX Research Report</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-08-25-how-should-prometheus-handle-opentelemetry-resource-attributes-a-ux-research-rep/</link><pubDate>Mon, 25 Aug 2025 19:42:02 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-08-25-how-should-prometheus-handle-opentelemetry-resource-attributes-a-ux-research-rep/</guid><description>Project background Research approach User interviews insights Survey insights What I didn’t expect to learn (but did) Recommended solutions Short-term solutions Long-term vision Acknowledgments What’s next for me Posted on August 25, 2025 by Victoria Nduka, User Experience Designer CNCF projects highlighted in this post On May 29th, 2025, I wrapped up my mentorship with Prometheus through the Linux Foundation Mentorship Program. My project focused on understanding how Prometheus handles OpenTelemetry resource attributes and how that experience could be improved for users. My job was to conduct user research to get the user perspective on this challenge. In three months, I conducted user and stakeholder interviews, ran a survey, and analyzed the findings. In this article, I’ll share how I conducted the research, what I uncovered and where the communities involved could go from here. OpenTelemetry (OTel) has something called a resource attribute, which is extra information about the source of a metric, like the service, host, or environment that generated it. Prometheus, a time-series database, uses labels to identify and query metrics. If resource attributes are converted to labels, they can cause what’s known as “a cardinality explosion”, essentially creating too many unique combinations that overwhelm the system. This usually happens if the attributes change often or include a lot of unique values, like user IDs or pod names. Currently, there are three main approaches to handling this challenge: Map all resource attributes to labels: This creates cardinality explosion problems, especially for applications with large numbers of attributes or frequently changing attribute values. Selective promotion: Users manually choose which resource attributes are important enough to be converted to labels in Prometheus. Target info pattern: Put all resource attributes in a separate metric called target_info.</description></item><item><title>How I Team Up with GenAI to Craft Conference Talk Proposals</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-08-22-how-i-team-up-with-genai-to-craft-conference-talk-proposals/</link><pubDate>Fri, 22 Aug 2025 20:09:07 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-08-22-how-i-team-up-with-genai-to-craft-conference-talk-proposals/</guid><description>An Incomplete List of GenAI Tells My Process Step One: Brainstorm Buddy Step Two: Shape the Story Step Three: Write the Abstract Prompt 1: Brainstorm Buddy Prompt 2: Shape the Story Prompt 3: Write the Abstract Enjoy the Result! Before you Submit LMKWYT! References Posted on August 22, 2025 by Whitney Lee, CNCF Ambassador and Senior Technical Advocate at Datadog TL;DR: GenAI can help you write conference abstracts, but if you use it without injecting your own curiosity and humanness, reviewers can tell. This post walks through my personal process for co-writing abstracts with GenAI in a way that preserves my voice and experience. I developed this process for technical talks, but it adapts well to other formats too. I’ve spoken at a lot of conferences, big and small. I’ve given keynotes. Breakouts. Workshops. I’ve been around the block and written many conference talk proposals. I’ve also been on program committees and reviewed others’ proposals. There’s always room for improvement, but I like to think I know what good is. In my view, here are some elements of a good talk proposal: – A clear, engaging idea (or a run-of-the-mill idea with a compelling angle) – Some clear details about the talk, like concrete examples or stories, or talk format and tools covered – Clear audience – Clear takeaways As you can imagine, the widespread use of GenAI to generate talk proposals has changed the game for both submitters and reviewers. As a submitter, you can type just one line into ChatGPT, for example: Write me a KubeCon + CloudNativeCon talk abstract on Validating Admission Policy And it produces something that, on the surface, looks pretty good!* Title: Enforcing What Matters: Building Safer Kubernetes with Validating Admission Policies Abstract: As Kubernetes adoption continues to grow across organizations, ensuring workloads meet security, compliance, and operational standards before hitting the cluster is more critical than ever.</description></item><item><title>Celebrating 100 Golden Kubestronauts</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-08-21-celebrating-100-golden-kubestronauts/</link><pubDate>Thu, 21 Aug 2025 13:59:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-08-21-celebrating-100-golden-kubestronauts/</guid><description>What is a Golden Kubestronaut?

This matters because while GenAI can generate content, ideas, or responses, it can’t act on them. However, when combined with Agentic AI, your systems shift from being reactive and prompt-driven to autonomous and outcome-oriented. This article aims to help senior technology leaders better understand the value Agentic AI can add to existing AI infrastructure, while outlining key considerations to determine whether its implementation aligns with your business needs. Image caption: Core components of an Agentic AI Architecture from Markovate. Agentic AI systems are designed to operate autonomously, perceiving their environment, making decisions, and executing actions without continuous human oversight. This autonomy enables businesses to streamline operations, reduce costs, and enhance scalability. The image above illustrates how the following systems function: Perception layer: This layer involves collecting data from various sources i. e. sensors, cameras, microphones, and digital inputs, to understand the current state of the environment. For businesses, this means real-time monitoring of operations, customer interactions, and market trends, facilitating proactive decision-making and rapid response to changing conditions. Cognition layer: Once data is collected, the cognition layer processes this information to interpret context, recognise patterns, and determine the best course of action.</description></item><item><title>Gear Up for the 5th Annual KCD Washington DC!</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-08-16-gear-up-for-the-5th-annual-kcd-washington-dc/</link><pubDate>Sat, 16 Aug 2025 13:04:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-08-16-gear-up-for-the-5th-annual-kcd-washington-dc/</guid><description>Posted on August 16, 2025 by Matthew Cascio, CNCF Ambassador and KCD Washington DC Organizer We’re so thrilled to be organizing another year of cloud native community in the Nation’s Capital. Past years have witnessed amazing presentations ranging from core Kubernetes topics to emerging trends in ML/AI, sustainability, virtual clusters and more. This year promises to be even more amazing. Our program is set, and includes two new innovations for our KCD: For the first time, we’re offering a hands-on workshop covering basic and intermediate topics on using Prometheus in your observability practice. The curriculum covers 20-25% of the Linux Foundation’s Prometheus Certified Associate (PCA) course. While this workshop does not lead to certification, and is not a substitute for the PCA course, it will give you a solid working knowledge for getting started and perhaps help you decide if you’d like to pursue certification separately – if you do, you’ll be ahead of the game with this solid foundation. We’re adding a government-focused cybersecurity keynote by our special guest, Ashley Jones, Cybersecurity Advisor for Region III of the Department of Homeland Security, Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA. ) Special Government &amp;amp; Cybersecurity Focus – and free admission for our government employee community members! You won’t want to miss Ashley Jones’ keynote if you’re a cybersecurity professional or involved in government technology in any way. A limited number of free tickets will be available soon for our community members working for federal, state or local government agencies. You can request a free government ticket here: https://forms. gle/aLNfRwpvFn3vQ5Vo8 Plus our regular program is amazing!
