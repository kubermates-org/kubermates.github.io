What made this experience even more meaningful was navigating it as a neurodivergent person and discovering spaces where people like me not only belong but are celebrated. KubeCon + CloudNativeCon is often talked about as a conference but in reality, it’s a community gathering. Since Day 1 the OpenTelemetry Observatory was filled with conversations of contributors and maintainers to which I participated, and it felt like a safe space for me. One of the most unforgettable moments of the week was receiving the 2025 OpenTelemetry Community Award. This recognition wasn’t just about my personal contributions, it was a reflection of the support, encouragement and generosity of a community that thrives on collaboration. The award reminded me of why open source matters: because it’s built by people who care. A particularly powerful part of my KubeCon journey was engaging with the Merge Forward initiative. Merge Forward is a CNCF Technical Community Group made up of several subgroups, including Deaf &amp;amp; Hard of Hearing, Blind &amp;amp; Visually Impaired, Stuttering &amp;amp; Speech Diversity, Women in Cloud Native, Deep Roots, Friends of Dorothy and Neurodiversity. Its mission is to build supportive networks and safe spaces where underrepresented communities and their allies can come together to learn, mentor, grow, and simply be themselves. Merge Forward provides a safe place for people to share experiences, find community, and ask for help without judgment. But we cannot do this alone; we need allies.</description></item><item><title>CNCF On-Demand: Cloud Native Inference at Scale - Unlocking LLM Deployments with KServe</title><link>https://kubermates.org/events/2025-12-04-cncf-on-demand-cloud-native-inference-at-scale-unlocking-llm-deployments-with-ks/</link><pubDate>Thu, 04 Dec 2025 08:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/events/2025-12-04-cncf-on-demand-cloud-native-inference-at-scale-unlocking-llm-deployments-with-ks/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;LLM inference has unique challenges—long prompts, token-by-token generation, bursty traffic, and the need for high GPU utilization—making routing, scheduling, and autoscaling harder than standard ML serving.

What are the different pod states in Kubernetes? How to restart pods in Kubernetes using kubectl Conclusion Posted on December 1, 2025 by Kevel Bhogayata, Principal Engineer, Middleware CNCF projects highlighted in this post This Member Blog was originally published on the Middleware blog and is republished here with permission. kubectl is the command-line interface for managing Kubernetes clusters. It allows you to manage pods, deployments, and other resources from the terminal, helping you troubleshoot Kubernetes issues. , check pod health, and scale applications easily. Most kubectl commands follow a simple structure. For example, kubectl get pods lists running pods, and kubectl delete pod &lt;pod-name&gt; removes a pod. kubectl get pods kubectl delete pod &lt;pod-name&gt; Many users wonder how to restart a Kubernetes pod using kubectl. Contrary to popular belief, there is no direct kubectl restart pod command. Instead, Kubernetes expects you to work with higher-level objects, such as Deployments. kubectl restart pod This guide covers the safest and most effective methods for restarting pods, including rollout restarts, deleting pods, scaling replicas, and updating environment variables, helping you manage pod restarts in a predictable and controlled way. Knowing when to restart a Kubernetes pod is key to maintaining application stability and performance. Here are the most common scenarios that require a pod restart: When you update your application’s settings (such as environment variables or resource limits), the pod continues to use the old configurations.</description></item><item><title>runc container breakout vulnerabilities: A technical overview</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-11-28-runc-container-breakout-vulnerabilities-a-technical-overview/</link><pubDate>Fri, 28 Nov 2025 12:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-11-28-runc-container-breakout-vulnerabilities-a-technical-overview/</guid><description>The vulnerabilities Exploitation scenarios and threat model Kubernetes and cloud native implications Affected versions and patches Mitigations The bigger picture: Secure-by-default configurations Credits Posted on November 28, 2025 by Matteo Bisi, DevSecOps Team Leader at ReeVo and CNCF KCD Organizer CNCF projects highlighted in this post A set of high-severity vulnerabilities in runc were publicly disclosed in November 2025, allowing for full container breakouts. Runc is the cornerstone of containerization on Linux, serving as the default low-level container runtime for industry-standard tools like Docker, Podman, and Kubernetes. Its ubiquity means that a vulnerability in runc has far-reaching implications for the entire cloud-native ecosystem. This post summarizes the vulnerabilities, the affected versions, and the recommended actions to mitigate them. Three vulnerabilities were discovered, all related to bypassing runc’s restrictions on writing to arbitrary /proc files. These vulnerabilities can be exploited by starting containers with custom mount configurations, including those defined in Dockerfiles (RUN –mount=…). CVE-2025-31133: “container escape via ‘masked path’ abuse due to mount race conditions” CVSS: 7.3 Description: This vulnerability exploits an issue with how masked paths are implemented. An attacker can replace /dev/null with a symlink to a procfs file (e. g. , /proc/sys/kernel/core_pattern or /proc/sysrq-trigger). Runc will then bind-mount the symlink target read-write, leading to a container breakout or a host crash. CVE-2025-52565: “container escape with malicious config due to /dev/console mount and related races” CVSS: 7.3 Description: Similar to the previous CVE, this vulnerability exploits a flaw in /dev/console bind-mounts.</description></item><item><title>From chaos to clarity: How OpenTelemetry unified observability across clouds</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-11-27-from-chaos-to-clarity-how-opentelemetry-unified-observability-across-clouds/</link><pubDate>Thu, 27 Nov 2025 12:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-11-27-from-chaos-to-clarity-how-opentelemetry-unified-observability-across-clouds/</guid><description>The problem: Observability tool sprawl The turning point: Why OpenTelemetry The solution: Implementing OpenTelemetry Benefits realized Lessons learned Conclusion Posted on November 27, 2025 by Arunvel Arunachalam, Infosys CNCF projects highlighted in this post Modern applications rarely live in a single place anymore. One organization’s application footprint was spread across AWS, Azure, and GCP , with some workloads still running on-prem. This multi-cloud approach gave them resilience and flexibility, but it came with a hidden cost: observability sprawl. Each cloud provider brought its own native observability stack. On AWS, they used CloudWatch ; on Azure, Azure Monitor ; on GCP, Stackdriver ; and in their on-prem setup, a mix of Prometheus and ELK. Add to that some third-party APM tools, and suddenly engineers were juggling five dashboards just to debug one request. This was slowing them down. Mean Time to Resolution (MTTR) kept climbing, and developers spent more time stitching together logs and traces than writing code. The turning point came when the organization adopted OpenTelemetry (OTel) , a CNCF graduated project and community-driven standard for observability. What started as a small experiment soon became the backbone of their observability strategy, aligning with the broader trend across the CNCF community toward platform engineering maturity and standardized telemetry practices. Let’s break down what was happening before OpenTelemetry: Multiple tools for the same purpose Metrics: Prometheus (on-prem) + CloudWatch (AWS) + Azure Monitor (Azure). Logs: ELK (on-prem) + Stackdriver (GCP).</description></item><item><title>Announcing Kyverno release 1.16</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-11-26-announcing-kyverno-release-1-16/</link><pubDate>Wed, 26 Nov 2025 20:44:24 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-11-26-announcing-kyverno-release-1-16/</guid><description>CEL policy types Kyverno Authz Server Introducing the Kyverno SDK Other features and enhancements Getting started and backward compatibility Roadmap Conclusion Posted on November 26, 2025 by Shuting Zhao, Kyverno Maintainer and a Staff Engineer at Nirmata CNCF projects highlighted in this post Kyverno 1.16 delivers major advancements in policy as code for Kubernetes, centered on a new generation of CEL-based policies now available in beta with a clear path to GA. This release introduces partial support for namespaced CEL policies to confine enforcement and minimize RBAC, aligning with least-privilege best practices. Observability is significantly enhanced with full metrics for CEL policies and native event generation, enabling precise visibility and faster troubleshooting. Security and governance get sharper controls through fine-grained policy exceptions tailored for CEL policies, and validation use cases broaden with the integration of an HTTP authorizer into ValidatingPolicy. Finally, we’re debuting the Kyverno SDK, laying the foundation for ecosystem integrations and custom tooling. CEL policy types are introduced as v1beta. The promotion plan provides a clear, non‑breaking path: v1 will be made available in 1.17 with GA targeted for 1.18. This release includes the cluster‑scoped family (Validating, Mutating, Generating, Deleting, ImageValidating) at v1beta1 and adds namespaced variants for validation, deleting, and image validation; namespaced Generating and Mutating will follow in 1.17. PolicyException and GlobalContextEntry will advance in step to keep versions aligned; see the promotion roadmap in this tracking issue. Kyverno 1.16 introduces namespaced CEL policy types— NamespacedValidatingPolicy , NamespacedDeletingPolicy , and NamespacedImageValidatingPolicy —which mirror their cluster-scoped counterparts but apply only within the policy’s namespace. This lets teams enforce guardrails with least-privilege RBAC and without central changes, improving multi-tenancy and safety during rollout. Choose namespaced types for team-owned namespaces and cluster-scoped types for global controls.</description></item><item><title>CNCF &amp; K8s Meetup de Novembre 2025 : KubeCon NA 2025 et KubeVirt, Harvester</title><link>https://kubermates.org/events/2025-11-25-cncf-k8s-meetup-de-novembre-2025-kubecon-na-2025-et-kubevirt-harvester/</link><pubDate>Tue, 25 Nov 2025 22:30:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/events/2025-11-25-cncf-k8s-meetup-de-novembre-2025-kubecon-na-2025-et-kubevirt-harvester/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;CNCF &amp;amp; K8s Meetup de Novembre 2025 : KubeCon NA 2025 et KubeVirt, Harvester&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Friends of Dorothy: Monthly Huddle</title><link>https://kubermates.org/events/2025-11-25-friends-of-dorothy-monthly-huddle/</link><pubDate>Tue, 25 Nov 2025 20:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/events/2025-11-25-friends-of-dorothy-monthly-huddle/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Join us for the inaugural &amp;lsquo;Friends of Dorothy&amp;rsquo; monthly meeting!

Once a platform team has selected its orchestration layer, one of the next architectural choices involves the deployment architecture where that cluster will run. Containers can be deployed directly on either bare metal servers or virtual machines. This article examines the characteristics, tradeoffs, and community learnings around deploying containers on bare metal compared to virtual machines. Historically, running workloads in containers on bare metal appealed to organizations that prioritized maximum performance and minimal infrastructure overhead. By bypassing the hypervisor layer, containers could directly access compute and storage resources. However, advancements in hypervisor technology have significantly improved the performance and efficiency of virtualized environments, making containers on virtual machines (VMs) viable for production workloads with added operational benefits and flexibility. As IT requirements have grown in recent years, platform teams now face expanded responsibilities, including enforcing stricter security policies, reducing fault domains for higher application availability, supporting multiple versions of conformant Kubernetes, and meeting tighter service-level agreements (SLAs). These are themes frequently discussed in CNCF TAG Runtime and TAG Security , particularly around multi-tenancy models, workload isolation, and lifecycle management. These modern demands and technological enhancements have renewed community discussions on where clusters should run and how platform teams can meet SLA, security, and multi-version requirements IT practitioners should consider the following factors when making this decision: Historically, bare metal offered a performance edge. Direct hardware access reduced latency and overhead, giving it an advantage in CPU- or GPU-intensive workloads. Recent benchmark studies indicate that the historical performance gap between bare metal and virtualized environments is now negligible.</description></item><item><title>#cTENcf Birthday Bash Bangkok 🚀 Celebrating a Decade Journey of Cloud-Native Galaxy</title><link>https://kubermates.org/events/2025-11-20-ctencf-birthday-bash-bangkok-celebrating-a-decade-journey-of-cloud-native-galaxy/</link><pubDate>Thu, 20 Nov 2025 11:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/events/2025-11-20-ctencf-birthday-bash-bangkok-celebrating-a-decade-journey-of-cloud-native-galaxy/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;🌟 About the CNCG#3 Bangkok Meetup: #cTENcf EventJoin the 3rd CNCF Bangkok Community MeetUp for an evening of deep techni&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CNCF On-Demand: Providing Replicated Kubernetes Storage with OpenEBS</title><link>https://kubermates.org/events/2025-11-20-cncf-on-demand-providing-replicated-kubernetes-storage-with-openebs/</link><pubDate>Thu, 20 Nov 2025 08:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/events/2025-11-20-cncf-on-demand-providing-replicated-kubernetes-storage-with-openebs/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;OpenEBS is a container-native storage solution that provides replicated persistent volumes for Kubernetes.

The entire flow of development, testing, documentation, deployment, rollback, etc. , can happen through developer self-service. It emerged from the need to overcome the limitations of traditional software development, which was often characterized by slow cycles, isolated teams, silos, and complex infrastructures. The main goal of Platform Engineering is to improve the developer experience (DevEx) and optimize software delivery. In essence, platform engineering seeks to: Provide standardized tools and services: Create a set of tools, services, and workflows that developers can easily use to build, deploy, and manage their applications. These tools can include IDEs, CLIs, project templates, code versioning, CI/CD pipelines, container orchestration tools, configuration management tools, and observability systems. Reduce complexity: Abstract the complexity of the underlying infrastructure and operations, allowing developers to focus on code and business logic. The growing complexity of infrastructure, the cloud computing era with different providers and vendors, multi-cloud adoption, and the proliferation of tools and artifacts in the “everything as code” era led to an increase in developers’ cognitive load. The lack of design patterns also became a problem. Increase productivity: Accelerate the development and deployment cycle, eliminating bottlenecks and repetitive tasks.</description></item><item><title>#7 Cloud Native Porto - Cloudy Magusto</title><link>https://kubermates.org/events/2025-11-18-7-cloud-native-porto-cloudy-magusto/</link><pubDate>Tue, 18 Nov 2025 18:30:54 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/events/2025-11-18-7-cloud-native-porto-cloudy-magusto/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;The next Cloud Native Porto event is here!

Technical debt piling up faster than teams can manage Ongoing upgrades A shifting tooling landscape Resources for managing tech debt: Bonus lesson: Not every workload belongs on Kubernetes Resources for managing Kubernetes: Bonus lesson: Policy enforcement Resources for policy enforcement: Building reliable, secure, and efficient Kubernetes Posted on November 18, 2025 by Stevie Caldwell, Tech Lead at Fairwinds CNCF projects highlighted in this post Kubernetes has transformed how modern organizations deploy and operate scalable infrastructure, and the hype around automated cloud native orchestration has made its adoption nearly ubiquitous over the past 10+ years. Yet behind the scenes, most teams embarking on their Kubernetes journey quickly encounter operational complexity, configuration challenges, and costly maintenance that few vendors highlight. Drawing from years of real-world experience architecting, building, and maintaining Kubernetes, we recently hosted a webinar sharing five hard-earned lessons to help organizations get started using the container orchestration tool. In this post, we’ve paired each lesson with useful resources and examples of how to navigate managing Kubernetes at scale, whether supporting your own teams, deploying across multiple clusters, or evaluating managed Kubernetes offerings. The Kubernetes community knows that spinning up a cluster is straightforward, especially if you use a managed provider such as AKS , EKS , or GKE. But in reality, running a production environment means managing all the hidden add-ons : DNS controllers, networking, storage, monitoring, logging, secrets, security, and more. Supporting internal users (dev teams, ops, and data scientists) adds significant overhead for any company running Kubernetes.&lt;/li&gt;

Get Involved Posted on November 18, 2025 by Nina Polshakova, Nadine Spies, &amp;amp; Michael Levan, Solo. io, Aryan Parashar, LFX Mentee CNCF projects highlighted in this post Kgateway is an open source implementation of the Kubernetes Gateway API that unifies ingress, API gateway, service mesh, and AI gateway capabilities in a singular modular control plane. Built for performance and flexibility, it secures and manages traffic across legacy, cloud native, and AI-driven workloads in any environment. We’re excited to announce the release of kgateway v2.1. , a release packed with exciting new features and improvements. Here are a few select updates the kgateway team would like to highlight! This release marks a major milestone — it’s the first version to integrate the open source project agentgateway ! Agentgateway is a highly available, highly scalable data plane that provides AI connectivity for LLMs, MCP tools, AI agents, and inference workloads. As part of this evolution, we’re beginning the deprecation of the Envoy-based AI Gateway and the Envoy-based Inference Extension, since all related functionality is now implemented natively through agentgateway. You can still continue to use Envoy-based Gateways for API Gateway use cases. For this release, agentgateway support is in beta. If you’re trying out the agentgateway GatewayClass , we recommend following the beta release feed to stay up to date with improvements, bug fixes, and breaking changes as the implementation is refined. agentgateway GatewayClass To get started with agentgateway, you simply install kgateway with the following Helm values: agentgateway : enabled : true Then you create a Gateway with the agentgateway GatewayClass as shown here: agentgateway GatewayClass kubectl apply -f- &amp;laquo;EOF kind : Gateway apiVersion : gateway. networking.</description></item><item><title>Blind and Visually Impaired Initiative Monthly Meeting</title><link>https://kubermates.org/events/2025-11-18-blind-and-visually-impaired-initiative-monthly-meeting/</link><pubDate>Tue, 18 Nov 2025 14:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/events/2025-11-18-blind-and-visually-impaired-initiative-monthly-meeting/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Join us for our monthly meeting!

Where Does It Fit in the Cloud Native Landscape? Use cases Lima’s Beginnings and Growth Maintainer Perspective From the TOC Main Components: Notable Milestones Latest release Posted on November 11, 2025 by Lima Project Maintainers CNCF projects highlighted in this post The CNCF Technical Oversight Committee (TOC) has voted to accept Lima as a CNCF incubating project. Lima enables secure, isolated environments for running cloud native and AI workloads. Lima, short for “Linux Machines,” provides Linux virtual machines optimized for running containers in local development environments. Lima comes with built-in integration for the following container engines : containerd [CNCF Graduated] (default) Docker Podman [CNCF Sandbox] Kubernetes [CNCF Graduated] k3s [CNCF Sandbox] k0s [CNCF Sandbox] Usernetes RKE2 k3s [CNCF Sandbox] k0s [CNCF Sandbox] Usernetes RKE2 Apptainer Lima is also known to be useful for a variety of other use cases beyond containerization. One of the most edgy use cases is to run an AI coding agent inside a VM in order to isolate the agent from direct access to host files and commands. This setup ensures that even if an AI agent is deceived by malicious instructions searched from the Internet (e. g. , fake package installations), any potential damage is confined within the VM or limited to files specified to be mounted from the host. The Lima website features several examples of hardening AI agents: Aider Claude Code Codex Gemini GitHub Copilot CLI GitHub Copilot in Visual Studio Code The Lima project was launched in May 2021 by Akihiro Suda, a maintainer of containerd and numerous other projects in the container ecosystem. The project was initially designed as a “containerd machine” aiming to demonstrate and promote containerd, including nerdctl (contaiNERD CTL), to Mac users. Later the project scope was expanded to support other container engines and non-container applications as well. Lima supports non-macOS hosts, such as Linux, NetBSD, and Windows.</description></item><item><title>OpenFGA Becomes a CNCF Incubating Project</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-11-11-openfga-becomes-a-cncf-incubating-project/</link><pubDate>Tue, 11 Nov 2025 14:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-11-11-openfga-becomes-a-cncf-incubating-project/</guid><description>What is OpenFGA? OpenFGA’s History Maintainer Perspective From the TOC Main Components Notable Milestones Looking Ahead Posted on November 11, 2025 by OpenFGA Project Maintainers CNCF projects highlighted in this post The CNCF Technical Oversight Committee (TOC) has voted to accept OpenFGA as a CNCF incubating project. OpenFGA is an authorization engine that addresses the challenge of implementing complex access control at scale in modern software applications. Inspired by Google’s global access control system, Zanzibar, OpenFGA leverages Relationship-Based Access Control (ReBAC). This allows developers to define permissions based on relationships between users and objects (e. g. , who can view which document). By serving as an external service with an API and multiple SDKs, it centralizes and abstracts the authorization logic out of the application code. This separation of concerns significantly improves developer velocity by simplifying security implementation and ensures that access rules are consistent, scalable, and easy to audit across all services, solving a critical complexity problem for developers building distributed systems. OpenFGA was developed by a group of Okta employees, and is the foundation for the Auth0 FGA commercial offering. The project was accepted as a CNCF Sandbox project in September 2022. Since then, it has been deployed by hundreds of companies and received multiple contributions. Some major moments and updates include: 37 companies publicly acknowledge using it in production.</description></item><item><title>Chaos Mesh Development Meeting</title><link>https://kubermates.org/events/2025-11-11-chaos-mesh-development-meeting/</link><pubDate>Tue, 11 Nov 2025 01:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/events/2025-11-11-chaos-mesh-development-meeting/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;This is a biweekly meeting to discuss anything related to the project development.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Container Install Meet-Up</title><link>https://kubermates.org/events/2025-11-10-container-install-meet-up/</link><pubDate>Mon, 10 Nov 2025 17:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/events/2025-11-10-container-install-meet-up/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;The Cloud Native Atlanta Group is excited to host members of the Apple Containerization dev team for a fun KubeCon 0 Day&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Falco Links Real-Time Detection with Forensic-Level Analysis in the Cloud Native Stack</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-11-10-falco-links-real-time-detection-with-forensic-level-analysis-in-the-cloud-native/</link><pubDate>Mon, 10 Nov 2025 14:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-11-10-falco-links-real-time-detection-with-forensic-level-analysis-in-the-cloud-native/</guid><description>New integration connects Falco alerts to Stratoshark’s forensic tools, delivering Wireshark-style visibility into system call and audit log data Key Highlights Falco, a CNCF graduated project, now integrates with Stratoshark to connect real-time security alerts with forensic-level capture and analysis tools. Security teams can instantly pivot from detection to deep investigation without switching tools, reducing response time and improving root cause analysis. Platform and security teams working across Kubernetes, containerized environments, and hybrid/multicloud infrastructure. Available now; demonstrated live at KubeCon + CloudNativeCon North America 2025 in Atlanta. ATLANTA—KUBECON + CLOUDNATIVECON NORTH AMERICA, Nov. 10, 2025 — The Cloud Native Computing Foundation® (CNCF®), which builds sustainable ecosystems for cloud native software, today announced new integrations between Falco , a graduated project, and Stratoshark , a forensic tool inspired by Wireshark. With this release, Falco alerts can now trigger precise forensic captures, allowing real-time threat detection to be paired with deeper event analysis. Security and platform teams have long faced challenges bringing together real-time threat detection and the detailed forensic visibility needed for effective incident response. Historically, security analysts and incident responders relied on separate tools to manually capture full system-call activity, producing large volumes of unfiltered data that often slowed down investigations and complicated incident resolution. Falco Captures provides on-demand event recording, enabling alerts when a security rule triggers. Each triggered alert comes with an automatically recorded trail of system calls, ready for immediate replay and inspection, equipping security analysts with precise, actionable insight. “We’ve long seen how alerts without context force a time‑costly hunt,” said Leonardo Grasso, core maintainer of Falco.</description></item><item><title>#cTENcf Birthday Bash Nashik</title><link>https://kubermates.org/events/2025-11-09-ctencf-birthday-bash-nashik/</link><pubDate>Sun, 09 Nov 2025 04:30:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/events/2025-11-09-ctencf-birthday-bash-nashik/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Be a part of the CTenCF event where exciting experiences await!

With code-level insights plus infrastructure observability, we can connect infrastructure signals to business outcomes. We can prove our value with Service Level Objectives (SLOs) like “99% of checkouts complete within 2 seconds. ” Not to mention the ability to auto-detect dependencies between services, automatically create dependency graphs, and power intelligent scaling. But instrumenting code is often a pain in the ass for developers. How do we motivate them to participate? Well, first off, we build application-adjacent observability collections into the platform as much as possible. What can we observe about our applications without the developer having to lift a finger? Framework-level telemetry : OpenTelemetry provides auto-instrumentation for popular programming languages, enabling your platform to collect trace data without modifying the code. You simply attach an agent, run your app with a startup flag, and it automatically implements common frameworks like HTTP servers, database clients, messaging libraries, Spring Boot, Express, etc. Kernel-level telemetry : The platform can also collect kernel-level insights using an eBPF-powered observability tool, such as Pixie or Cilium. Network-level telemetry : These can come from your service mesh technologies, like Istio, Linkerd, or Cilium. All of this you can do without the developer writing a single line of observability-related code.</description></item><item><title>Self-hosted human and machine identities in Keycloak 26.4</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-11-07-self-hosted-human-and-machine-identities-in-keycloak-26-4/</link><pubDate>Fri, 07 Nov 2025 15:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-11-07-self-hosted-human-and-machine-identities-in-keycloak-26-4/</guid><description>What’s New in 26.4 Passwordless user authentication with Passkeys Tightened OpenID Connect security with FAPI 2 and DPoP Simplified deployments across multiple availability zones Authenticating applications with Kubernetes service account tokens or SPIFFE Looking ahead Posted on November 7, 2025 by Alexander Schwartz CNCF projects highlighted in this post Keycloak is a leading open source solution in the cloud-native ecosystem for Identity and Access Management, a key component of accessing applications and their data.

With over 3,000 contributors from more than 450 organizations, Crossplane ranks in the top 10% of all CNCF projects for contributor engagement and authorship. Crossplane has delivered over 100 releases, including the recent Crossplane v2.0, which introduces a more refined architecture for building full application control planes and enhances support for AI-driven operations. Crossplane is now a graduated CNCF project and is available for production use today. SAN FRANCISCO, Calif. – November 6, 2025 – The Cloud Native Computing Foundation® (CNCF®), which builds sustainable ecosystems for cloud native software, today announced the graduation of Crossplane , recognizing its maturity, wide adoption, and strong community momentum, along with its importance in cloud native platform engineering. Crossplane brings the universal contract of declarative APIs to cloud infrastructure, applications, and services. It turns infrastructure into programmable, policy-driven software, enabling both humans and intelligent agents to request and manage environments safely through APIs rather than scripts or tickets. As AI begins to drive the need for more operations, Crossplane’s architecture offers the predictability and safety required for automation. Its declarative model allows intelligent agents to operate cloud environments by targeting outcomes instead of executing instructions, helping bridge human-operated and AI-operated infrastructure. “Crossplane’s graduation marks a major milestone for cloud native and multi cloud platform engineering,” said Chris Aniszczyk, CTO, CNCF. “Crossplane empowers teams to build secure, scalable internal platforms.</description></item><item><title>#cTENcf Birthday Bash Budapest</title><link>https://kubermates.org/events/2025-11-06-ctencf-birthday-bash-budapest/</link><pubDate>Thu, 06 Nov 2025 16:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/events/2025-11-06-ctencf-birthday-bash-budapest/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;#cTENcf Birthday Bash Budapest&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CNCF Ambassador’s reflections on 10 years of the Cloud Native Computing Foundation</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-11-06-cncf-ambassador-s-reflections-on-10-years-of-the-cloud-native-computing-foundati/</link><pubDate>Thu, 06 Nov 2025 15:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-11-06-cncf-ambassador-s-reflections-on-10-years-of-the-cloud-native-computing-foundati/</guid><description>Posted on November 6, 2025 by Dotan Horovits CNCF projects highlighted in this post Ambassador post originally published on Medium by Dotan Horovits “Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) is a new open standardization initiative recently formed under the Linux Foundation with the mission of providing standard reference architecture for cloud native applications and services, based on open-source software (OSS). ” That’s how I started my blog post 10 years ago , in August 2015 (back then I blogged on WordPress). And the momentum carried on. Eight months later I was excited to share that Prometheus joined The CNCF. Prometheus has since become a de-facto standard for cloud-native monitoring, and recently reached an important milestone with the long-awaited 3.0 major release. More projects have followed suit and joined the CNCF to augment Kubernetes with needed capabilities for running critical production workloads and managing them at scale, addressing aspects such as observability, security and networking. This ecosystem has fortified Kubernetes as the de-facto standard for container orchestration (remember that 10 years ago we had also Docker swarm, Mesos, Nomad?). In fact, just last year we celebrated 10 years to Kubernetes (or as we called it in the CNCF: kuberTENes). Since then the CNCF has grown to over 200 projects in various maturity stages, including over 30 graduated project. The domains have also expanded from Kubernetes and its immediate circle in the DevOps domain, into far wider topics, ranging from FinOps to Platform Engineering and chaos engineering.

Test environment setup Scenario 1: Applying the first default-deny policy Solution 1. a: Endpoint audit mode Solution 1. b: Policy default-deny mode Scenario 2: Making changes to the existing policies Solution 2. a: L7 allow-all Summary &amp;amp; next steps Posted on November 6, 2025 by Dean Lewis, Isovalent CNCF projects highlighted in this post Network policy changes are among the most frequent operations in a Kubernetes cluster. They are also among the most delicate, as even a small mistake can lead to widespread traffic disruption. This tutorial walks through several methods to make policy management safer, especially in day-2 operations or brownfield deployments where clusters already run critical workloads. It shows how to test and validate changes before enforcing them, helping teams adopt a more reliable approach to policy rollout. By following these steps, you can build confidence in your network policy lifecycle and reduce the likelihood of accidental outages. Cilium network policies build upon Kubernetes NetworkPolicy, extending it with deeper visibility and more flexible rule types. Policies are used to allow or deny traffic based on defined rules, which can apply to ingress, egress, or both. These rules are evaluated at the datapath level, meaning enforcement can take place directly in the kernel through eBPF. Every Cilium-managed endpoint operates under a policy enforcement mode, which defines the default network behavior before and after a policy is applied: Default: All traffic is allowed until an endpoint is selected by a policy.</description></item><item><title>CNCF On-Demand: From Chaos to Control in Enterprise AI/ML</title><link>https://kubermates.org/events/2025-11-06-cncf-on-demand-from-chaos-to-control-in-enterprise-ai-ml/</link><pubDate>Thu, 06 Nov 2025 08:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/events/2025-11-06-cncf-on-demand-from-chaos-to-control-in-enterprise-ai-ml/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Your container registry can do more than store Docker images—it can transform how you ship ML models.

The donation will support both the Linux Foundation and Cloud Native Computing Foundation. As cloud native technologies evolve to address AI, edge, and platform engineering demands, the infrastructure required to build, test, and scale these projects grows more complex. CI/CD pipelines, release testing, and performance benchmarking often require significant compute power. Community-led projects can struggle to access the necessary infrastructure without dependable support. Cloud credit donations are critical for enabling sustainable project operations without shifting costs to maintainers. Akamai’s credit contribution will allow CNCF to better support scalable, resilient infrastructure that benefits a range of technical initiatives. “We’re incredibly grateful for Akamai’s infrastructure contribution—it’s the kind of support that helps our community scale—experiment—and push cloud native innovation forward,” said Chris Aniszczyk, CTO of the Cloud Native Computing Foundation. “When our members invest like this, it strengthens the resilience and long-term impact of the entire ecosystem. ” As a Gold member, Akamai has deepened its collaboration with CNCF to ensure that projects can access the cloud infrastructure they need to thrive. We will direct the credits toward supporting project infrastructure needs.</description></item><item><title>Introducing the CNCF End User Contributor Program: Earn Access, Influence, and Recognition</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-11-05-introducing-the-cncf-end-user-contributor-program-earn-access-influence-and-reco/</link><pubDate>Wed, 05 Nov 2025 14:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-11-05-introducing-the-cncf-end-user-contributor-program-earn-access-influence-and-reco/</guid><description>Program Transition: Retiring the End User Supporter Program Your Two Pathways to End User Engagement The Future is Bright for Contributors Who can join? How to apply Posted on November 5, 2025 by Eliza Power The cloud native ecosystem runs on the contributions from many sources– including vendors, developers, academics, and importantly, end users. The real-world production experience of end-user organizations is essential for project evolution and growth. If your organization is a CNCF End User and is contributing insights, code, case studies, demos, or feedback to the CNCF ecosystem, then this announcement is for you. We’re thrilled to announce the launch of the CNCF End User Contributor Program ; a zero-fees pathway for End Users to connect with our community, influence its technical direction, and earn public recognition. With this launch, we’re retiring the End User Support Program – and we want to thank every organization that participated for their valuable support. For Existing End User Supporters: To ensure a smooth transition, existing End User Supporters can renew for one more year under the existing program as long as their renewal term commences on or before January 1, 2026. But we won’t be accepting any new Supporters going forward. Going forward, End User organizations have two distinct, value-driven options for engagement. Both grant access to our End User community, but they differ in benefits: The End User Contributor Program is the free pathway to ensure your company remains connected to the heart of the CNCF End User community and its programs. As a qualified End User Contributor , your organization gains access to specialized events, programs, and privileges, including: Exclusive access to End User programs: Participate in initiatives and programs tailored specifically for cloud native end users. Attend End User-only events at KubeCon + CloudNativeCon: Connect with peers, project leaders, and CNCF leadership in dedicated sessions and networking events Participate in End User groups: Engage in focused discussions, share challenges, and collaborate on solutions with other End Users. Eligibility for the End User Technical Advisory Board (TAB): Run for and participate in the End User TAB, directly influencing CNCF’s technical vision and project oversight from an end-user perspective.</description></item><item><title>Announcing Vitess 23.0.0</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-11-04-announcing-vitess-23-0-0/</link><pubDate>Tue, 04 Nov 2025 19:13:35 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-11-04-announcing-vitess-23-0-0/</guid><description>Why This Release Matters What’s New in Vitess 23 New Default Versions New &amp;amp; Improved Metrics Deprecations &amp;amp; Removals Topology &amp;amp; VTOrc Enhancements VTTablet &amp;amp; CLI / Docker Updates Upgrade Notes What’s Next Thanks &amp;amp; Acknowledgements Posted on November 4, 2025 by The Vitess Team CNCF projects highlighted in this post The Vitess team is excited to release Vitess 23.0.0 — the latest major version of Vitess — bringing new defaults, better operational tooling, and refined metrics. This release builds on the strong foundation of version 22 and is designed to make deployment and observability smoother, while continuing to scale MySQL workloads horizontally with confidence For production users of Vitess, this release is meaningful in several ways: Upgrading defaults: Moving to MySQL 8.4 as default future-proofs deployments and signals forward compatibility. Better metrics: The added observability enables deeper insights into transaction routing, shard behavior, and recovery actions — making debugging and alerting more precise. Clean-ups &amp;amp; deprecations: Removing legacy metrics and APIs simplifies monitoring and avoids confusion. Operational strength: Enhanced VTOrc and topology controls reduce risk in large-scale fleets and tighten security boundaries.

Organizations must balance compliance, cost control, and developer experience while delivering consistency at scale. At RBC, we addressed this by building a secure and scalable Infrastructure as Code (IaC) strategy tailored for hybrid environments. Our ambition extends beyond being a leading financial institution—we’re developing the internal capabilities, engineering practices, and developer platforms to operate like a modern technology company. To deliver a consistent infrastructure experience, RBC embraced three guiding principles: compliance, cost management, and developer convenience. Security and regulatory requirements were prioritized, cloud spending was closely monitored and optimized, and developer productivity was enhanced by making infrastructure management seamless. A centralized IaC platform enabled uniform workflows. By deploying execution agents within each cloud or on-premises zone, deployments became faster, localized, and more secure—keeping sensitive data within appropriate boundaries. This was a foundational step in our broader transformation: elevating infrastructure as a first-class product and treating platform engineering as a core competency, not a support function. It’s how we’re enabling RBC to scale, while preserving the security and trust expected of a global financial institution. Operating in a regulated industry means security is non-negotiable. RBC embedded policy-as-code into every stage of the infrastructure lifecycle.</description></item><item><title>Tool descriptions are eating up all your AI tokens (but they don’t have to)</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-10-31-tool-descriptions-are-eating-up-all-your-ai-tokens-but-they-don-t-have-to/</link><pubDate>Fri, 31 Oct 2025 14:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-10-31-tool-descriptions-are-eating-up-all-your-ai-tokens-but-they-don-t-have-to/</guid><description>Where the waste comes from Reducing token waste with smarter tool selection Community-driven innovation Looking ahead Posted on October 31, 2025 by Craig McLuckie, Stacklok The vast majority of developers now use AI coding assistants daily. As these tools become more advanced and widely adopted, usage quotas and rate limits have also become a familiar frustration. Many providers enforce weekly or monthly usage caps to manage compute costs. Once you hit a limit, you might be blocked, throttled, or shifted to slower processing queues — halting productivity and disrupting your workflow. But there’s a surprising reason behind much of this token consumption: wasted tool metadata. As contributors exploring the Model Context Protocol (MCP) have found, the vast majority of tokens consumed by AI coding assistants come not from your prompts or code, but from unnecessary tool descriptions that get bundled into each request. Let’s say you’ve installed MCP servers for GitHub, Grafana, and Notion. You ask your AI coding assistant to: “List the 10 most recent issues from my GitHub repo. ” That simple prompt uses 102,000 tokens, not because the task is complex, but because the model receives metadata for 114 tools, most of which have nothing to do with the request. Other common prompts create similar waste: “Summarize my meeting notes from October 19, 2025” uses 240,600 tokens, again with 114 tools injected, even though only the Notion server is relevant “Search dashboards related to RDS” consumes 93,600 tokens In each case, only a small fraction of those tokens are relevant to the task. Even saying “hello” burns more than 46,000 tokens. Multiply that across even a few dozen prompts per day, and you’re burning millions of tokens on context the model doesn’t need.</description></item><item><title>CNCF Abuja Meetup: How to Scale Your Career with CNCF Contributions</title><link>https://kubermates.org/events/2025-10-31-cncf-abuja-meetup-how-to-scale-your-career-with-cncf-contributions/</link><pubDate>Fri, 31 Oct 2025 11:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/events/2025-10-31-cncf-abuja-meetup-how-to-scale-your-career-with-cncf-contributions/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Join us for the CNCF Abuja October Virtual Meetup as we dive into exciting topics that highlight the versatility of cloud-native technologies and the thriving open-source community.

A simple phishing email to its maintainer opened the door for attackers to inject malicious code into the software supply chain, embedding backdoors into thousands of downstream applications. This incident is more than a one-off breach; it’s a warning shot for the entire open source ecosystem. Even trusted dependencies can become vectors for sophisticated supply-chain attacks. As development pipelines grow increasingly automated, traditional defenses are no longer enough. To stay secure, organizations must rethink the foundation of their containers themselves. That’s where distroless containers come in—stripping away unnecessary components to eliminate entire classes of vulnerabilities before they can be exploited. Traditional containers are built like miniature operating systems. They include shells, package managers, network tools, and other system utilities — many of which are unnecessary for the application but are ideal targets for attackers. When the malicious ‘is’ package was executed in these environments, it had access to tools to download more payloads, connect to remote servers, and persist in the system. In essence, developers unintentionally shipped a hacker’s toolkit into production. Distroless containers flip this paradigm by including only the essentials required to run an application — nothing more.</description></item><item><title>Preparativos para Cloud Native LATAM Summit</title><link>https://kubermates.org/events/2025-10-30-preparativos-para-cloud-native-latam-summit/</link><pubDate>Thu, 30 Oct 2025 00:30:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/events/2025-10-30-preparativos-para-cloud-native-latam-summit/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Únete a nosotros en los Preparativos para el Cloud Native LATAM Summit.

Modern businesses are rapidly adopting distributed architectures to meet growing demands for performance, resilience, and global reach. This shift is driven by emerging workloads that demand distributed infrastructure: AI/ML model training distributed across GPU clusters, real-time edge analytics processing IoT data streams, and global enterprise operations that require seamless connectivity across on-premises workloads, data centers, cloud providers, and edge locations. Today businesses are increasingly struggling to ensure secure, reliable and high-performance global connectivity while maintaining visibility across this distributed infrastructure. How do you maintain consistent end-to-end policies when applications traverse multiple network boundaries? How do you optimize performance for latency-sensitive critical applications when they could be running anywhere? And how do you gain clear visibility into application communication across this complex, multi-cluster, multi-cloud landscape? This is where a modern, integrated approach to networking becomes essential, one that understands both the intricacies of Kubernetes and the demands of wide-area connectivity. Let’s explore a proposal for seamlessly bridging your Kubernetes clusters, regardless of location, while intelligently managing the underlying network paths. Such an integrated approach solves several critical business needs: Unified security posture : Consistent policy enforcement from the wide-area network down to individual microservices. Optimized performance : Intelligent traffic routing that adapts to real-time conditions and application requirements. Global visibility : End-to-end observability across all layers of the network stack. In this post we discuss how to interconnect Cilium with a Software-Defined Wide Area Network (SD-WAN) fabric to extend Kubernetes-native traffic management and security policies into the underlying network interconnect. Learn how such integration simplifies operations while delivering the performance and security modern distributed workloads demand. Imagine a globally distributed service deployed across dozens of locations worldwide.</description></item><item><title>Cloud Native Day - São Paulo 2025</title><link>https://kubermates.org/events/2025-10-25-cloud-native-day-s-o-paulo-2025/</link><pubDate>Sat, 25 Oct 2025 12:30:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/events/2025-10-25-cloud-native-day-s-o-paulo-2025/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;🌟 Cloud Native Day São Paulo - 2025 ! 🌟🇧🇷🗓 Data: Sabado, 25 de outubro de 2025📍 Local: Nubank - Av.

By 2025, the CNCF proudly supports over 200 active projects , generating thousands of meetings annually. This rapid expansion, while a testament to the thriving cloud native ecosystem, also presented a unique set of operational challenges, particularly in managing project calendars. Historically, CNCF staff members manually managed a central Google Calendar for all projects, handling requests for meeting additions, changes, and removals through a high-volume service desk ticketing system. For anyone who has struggled to keep even a couple of personal calendars synchronized, the complexity of managing over 200 project calendars on behalf of diverse communities is easily imaginable. This labor-intensive process, while functional, was not scalable and often led to bottlenecks for both projects and staff. The CNCF Projects team is continuously seeking innovative ways to enhance the project experience through automation and increased autonomy. Recognizing the need for a more efficient and empowering calendar solution, the team initiated a significant transition in June 2025. Projects are now being migrated to the new CNCF calendar system, a robust platform backed by the Linux Foundation’s LFX infrastructure. This new system introduces self-managed calendars for every project, empowering maintainers with direct control over their scheduling. The foundation of this new calendar system is the Linux Foundation Project Control Center (PCC). PCC serves as the single source of truth for project lifecycle information, dynamically pulling essential details such as project logos, calendar links, and GitHub links, and displaying them directly on the new calendar interface.</description></item><item><title>Highlights from CNCF’s first Open Observability Summit</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-10-23-highlights-from-cncf-s-first-open-observability-summit/</link><pubDate>Thu, 23 Oct 2025 14:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-10-23-highlights-from-cncf-s-first-open-observability-summit/</guid><description>The first foundation-led conference on open observability Fluent Bit vs. OpenTelemetry Collector: A benchmark face-off Real-world scale: Observability at eBay Bringing OpenTelemetry to Android with Kotlin SDK Deep-dive on tuning the OpenTelemetry Collector Broadcom’s end-to-end observability: From mobile to mainframe Spotify’s metric migration: From in-house TSDB to VictoriaMetrics and Prometheus Introducing Rotel: A Rust-based alternative to the OpenTelemetry Collector AI is a hot topic in observability Posted on October 23, 2025 by Dotan Horovits CNCF projects highlighted in this post Ambassador post originally published on Medium by Dotan Horovits It’s about time open observability had its own industry-wide, vendor-neutral event. This year, the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) finally made it happen with the inaugural Open Observability Summit , bringing together contributors, practitioners, and end users for a packed day of learning and collaboration. I was honored to deliver a keynote at this important event, as well as have my podcast OpenObservability Talks as a partner of the event. I dedicated my latest episode to covering the highlights from the event, and invited two fellow observability veterans and speakers of the event — Alok Bhide , member of the summit’s content committee and Head of Product Innovation at Chronosphere, and Henrik Rexed , Developer Advocate at Dynatrace, CNCF Ambassador, and host of the Is It Observable podcast. Together, we unpacked the summit highlights. Here’s a recap, and you can find the full recording on all the podcast apps, with links bellow. Where’s the community’s meeting point to discuss open source observability? There are quite a few conferences out there on observability, but they are largely owned by vendors in this space. And with Monitorma currently on pause, it leaves us with no good place to come together. The CNCF has done great job in bringing everyone together, dovetailing Open Source Summit North America. Alok, who’s been on the program committeee and got to review and select the talks on the Call For Papers, shared on the balance of the talks and breadth of the projects covered: “combination of foundational talks and the shining new things… and across the different projects: OTel, FluentBit, Jaeger, Prometheus, everything. ” This resulted in some great talks, which are already available online on the CNCF’s YouTube channel.</description></item><item><title>La Historia de la Tecnología en Panamá con Gerardo Nunez</title><link>https://kubermates.org/events/2025-10-23-la-historia-de-la-tecnolog-a-en-panam-con-gerardo-nunez/</link><pubDate>Thu, 23 Oct 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/events/2025-10-23-la-historia-de-la-tecnolog-a-en-panam-con-gerardo-nunez/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Únete a nosotros para una emocionante sesión titulada La Historia de la Tecnología en Panamá con Gerardo Nunez.

Why Insights matters for end users 5 Key features for end users LF Open Source Index Coverage beyond Linux Foundation projects Project health score Contributor and organization attribution Report faulty or incomplete data How you can use Insights Explore LFX Insights Posted on October 22, 2025 by Ricardo Rocha, Cern Open source forms the backbone of modern technology ecosystems. From orchestration and observability to frameworks and developer tools, today’s technology choices depend on projects we may not control but rely on every day. The challenge: not all projects are equal. Some are maintained by large, diverse contributor bases. Others hinge on a handful of individuals. Some projects are responsive to security issues, while others leave risks unaddressed. Until now, it has been hard to see which projects are truly healthy. That’s the gap LFX Insights is built to close. ​​LFX Insights, developed by the Linux Foundation, helps organizations make informed decisions about the open source projects they depend on. Instead of relying on surface-level metrics like GitHub stars, Insights helps you answer deeper questions such as: Is this project actively maintained? Is there a healthy mix of contributors and organizations? How quickly are issues and pull requests being resolved? Does the project follow good security and governance practices? It gives you the information you need to select, adopt, and invest in open source projects with confidence. End users carry real risk when dependencies aren’t healthy. We’ve all seen the consequences: left-pad’s removal, the Log4Shell vulnerability, or the recent XZ backdoor attempt.</description></item><item><title>Cloud Native Maturity Model 4.0 (Beta): Reflecting what’s next for cloud native — and we want your input</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-10-22-cloud-native-maturity-model-4-0-beta-reflecting-what-s-next-for-cloud-native-and/</link><pubDate>Wed, 22 Oct 2025 14:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-10-22-cloud-native-maturity-model-4-0-beta-reflecting-what-s-next-for-cloud-native-and/</guid><description>What’s new in version 4.0 Why this matters What the community is saying Join the conversation Posted on October 22, 2025 by Danielle Cook, Simon Forster, Robert Glenn The CNCF Cartografos Working Group is excited to announce the beta release of the Cloud Native Maturity Model 4.0. This version expands the framework to include AI, FinOps, and evolving cultural practices. We invite the community to review the model and help shape the final release. The Cloud Native Maturity Model (CNMM) was created to support you, whether you’re just beginning your cloud native journey, leading a team, or already an expert. It helps identify where you may need to invest in tools, processes, people, or policies. Most importantly, it connects technical goals to business outcomes, giving you a framework to communicate the value of cloud native strategy to leadership. Since its initial launch in 2021 (with updates in 2022 and 2023), the model has helped organizations navigate adoption and maturity. Now, the Cartografos Working Group is excited to share the beta release of Version 4.0 —and we want your input. Key updates in CNMM 4.0 (Beta): Expanded focus on AI, emerging technologies, and FinOps Business-first maturity levels aligning outcomes with technical progress Shift-left approach to policy and governance Direct links to CNCF TAGs, working groups, and architectural references Cloud native has evolved rapidly, and CNMM 4.0 reflects those changes. This release expands coverage of AI, emerging technologies, and the cultural shifts required for success. It continues to emphasize that cloud native maturity must serve the business – not just technology for technology’s sake. Too often, conversations focus on Kubernetes or infrastructure in isolation.</description></item><item><title>Cloud Native Live: kcp – Kubernetes-Like Control Planes for Declarative APIs</title><link>https://kubermates.org/events/2025-10-21-cloud-native-live-kcp-kubernetes-like-control-planes-for-declarative-apis/</link><pubDate>Tue, 21 Oct 2025 16:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/events/2025-10-21-cloud-native-live-kcp-kubernetes-like-control-planes-for-declarative-apis/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;This session explores the fundamental concepts of kcp, its usage of the KRM and how to publish and reconcile Kubernetes-like APIs to a multitude of users.

Inside RBAC policy (Everest Example) Common RBAC roles in practice Validating and testing policies Best practices for RBAC in stateful workloads Conclusion Posted on October 21, 2025 by Edith Puclla, Percona CNCF projects highlighted in this post Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) is one of the most important security features in any cloud native platform. It determines who can do what inside the Kubernetes Cluster , helping teams give the right access to the right people, keep systems safer, and make permissions easy to manage. Learn how to apply Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) to manage database workloads safely and effectively on Kubernetes. Using Percona Everest as an example, this post demonstrates how to implement roles for developers, DBAs, and operators — with step-by-step policies and best practices. In the Kubernetes ecosystem, RBAC is usually discussed in the context of pods, nodes, or cluster-level resources, and when it comes to stateful workloads, especially databases, RBAC becomes even more critical. Databases carry sensitive data, backups, and credentials, so you want developers, DBAs, and operators to have the right level of access, no more, no less. In this post, I’ll use a database management platform running on Kubernetes as a case study to walk through RBAC concepts. Specifically, I’ll use Percona Everest , an open-source platform for running and managing databases on Kubernetes. Everest provides a UI, CLI, and API to create and manage PostgreSQL , MongoDB , and MySQL clusters. I will show examples using Everest’s RBAC, but the principles apply to any Kubernetes database platform. Note: Kubernetes already includes RBAC to manage access to cluster resources like pods and nodes. Platform like Percona Everest build on top of this their own RBAC layer for database-specific actions (clusters, backups, restores), and this post focuses on that layer.</description></item><item><title>Blind and Visually Impaired Initiative Monthly Meeting</title><link>https://kubermates.org/events/2025-10-21-blind-and-visually-impaired-initiative-monthly-meeting/</link><pubDate>Tue, 21 Oct 2025 13:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/events/2025-10-21-blind-and-visually-impaired-initiative-monthly-meeting/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Join us for our monthly meeting!

This article shares my complete experience through the LFX Mentorship program, where I added OpenTelemetry distributed tracing support to kgateway’s AI Gateway functionality. From application strategies for LFX Mentorship to challenges and insights during project implementation, I hope this provides a valuable reference for students who want to participate in open source projects. Before applying for LFX Mentorship, I had already been exposed to [OpenTelemetry](https://opentelemetry. io/) during my internship, gaining foundational knowledge in the observability domain. More importantly, I participated in the Jaeger community’s development work to add Clickhouse support for traces ([PR #6935](https://github. com/jaegertracing/jaeger/pull/6935)), which gave me practical experience with distributed tracing. These experiences made me feel that the LFX Mentorship project about AI Gateway distributed tracing was an excellent opportunity to deepen my learning and contribute to the open source community. I know everyone gets excited when they see a project they’re interested in and can’t wait to apply. I adopted a different strategy: first deeply understand the project, actively participate in the community, and then submit the application. Instead of rushing to submit my application, I first went to actually experience the product involved in the project: [AI Gateway](https://kgateway. dev/docs/ai/about/).</description></item><item><title>Opensource Connect Lahore</title><link>https://kubermates.org/events/2025-10-18-opensource-connect-lahore/</link><pubDate>Sat, 18 Oct 2025 10:10:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/events/2025-10-18-opensource-connect-lahore/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;A community meetup in Lahore bringing developers, students, and tech enthusiasts together to learn, share, and collaborate on open source.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Hacktoberfest Lahore 2025: Secure Cloud Edition</title><link>https://kubermates.org/events/2025-10-18-hacktoberfest-lahore-2025-secure-cloud-edition/</link><pubDate>Sat, 18 Oct 2025 06:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/events/2025-10-18-hacktoberfest-lahore-2025-secure-cloud-edition/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Hacktoberfest Lahore: Secure Cloud Edition is a community-driven celebration of open source, cloud-native technologies, &amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Why Autonomous Infrastructure is the future: From intent to self-operating systems</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-10-17-why-autonomous-infrastructure-is-the-future-from-intent-to-self-operating-system/</link><pubDate>Fri, 17 Oct 2025 18:03:45 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-10-17-why-autonomous-infrastructure-is-the-future-from-intent-to-self-operating-system/</guid><description>When AI development meets AI operations Beyond automation: The three phases of infrastructure evolution Phase 1: Manual infrastructure (2010-2020) Phase 2: Automated infrastructure (2020-2025) Phase 3: Autonomous infrastructure (2025-2030) The deterministic + probabilistic convergence The end of infrastructure as a limiting factor From reactive fire-fighting to proactive intelligence Theulti-agent infrastructure lifecycle What makes infrastructure truly autonomous The five levels of infrastructure autonomy Beyond today: The infrastructure AGI vision Building the future together Making the transition: From vision to reality Posted on October 17, 2025 by Asif Awan, StackGen Executive summary: We’re at an inflection point where AI-generated code meets AI-managed infrastructure, creating truly self-sustaining systems. This convergence transforms infrastructure from static pipelines to autonomous systems that build, govern, heal, and optimize themselves. Organizations have a narrow window to establish competitive advantage through autonomous infrastructure adoption—particularly in technology-driven industries where infrastructure agility directly impacts market responsiveness. AI is increasingly being applied in infrastructure, moving from assistive tools toward systems that can make autonomous decisions. This shift builds on earlier conversations in the community around intent-to-infrastructure approaches , such as those highlighted at PlatformCon this year, where platform engineers discussed using AI to address bottlenecks. In this post , we describe one implementation of that idea: infrastructure that can operate with minimal human intervention, guided by intent-driven inputs. We’re approaching an inflection point where AI-generated code meets AI-managed infrastructure. This convergence is transforming infrastructure from static pipelines to intelligent systems that can generate, adapt, and evolve continuously. While AI has accelerated development tasks by 2-3x , infrastructure bottlenecks continue to drain $2.5 million annually per 100 developers in lost productivity. But this isn’t just about efficiency—it’s about a fundamental transformation in how we conceive of infrastructure itself. The shift from traditional automation to autonomous systems represents the next phase of infrastructure evolution. Where conventional automation manages what already exists, autonomous infrastructure builds, governs, heals, and optimizes itself.</description></item><item><title>KubeCon + CloudNativeCon North America 2025 Co-Located Event Deep Dive: Platform Engineering Day</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-10-17-kubecon-cloudnativecon-north-america-2025-co-located-event-deep-dive-platform-en/</link><pubDate>Fri, 17 Oct 2025 13:55:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-10-17-kubecon-cloudnativecon-north-america-2025-co-located-event-deep-dive-platform-en/</guid><description>Who will get the most out of attending this event?

In this post, I’ll explore how open source projects like KEDA and Karpenter can help you balance performance, reliability, and cost in Kubernetes autoscaling. When we talk about Kubernetes autoscaling , it’s not just about adding replicas or nodes when demand grows and removing them when it shrinks. You have to balance performance , reliability , and cost — three forces that constantly pull against each other. The way I like to think about these three pillars is as a triangle , like in the following figure. These three pillars create natural tension. Before your application’s performance degrades, you need to add resources — which increases cost. To save on cost, you scale down resources — which can impact reliability. So how do we find the right balance? Let’s explore tools and recommendations for each pillar. Before you start scaling, you need to understand what truly impacts the performance of your application — what matters to your users and stakeholders. Most of the time, they don’t care about CPU or memory usage directly. These may be indicators, but they don’t always tell the full story.</description></item><item><title>Plongez dans les coulisses de Prometheus 3.0</title><link>https://kubermates.org/events/2025-10-16-plongez-dans-les-coulisses-de-prometheus-3-0/</link><pubDate>Thu, 16 Oct 2025 16:30:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/events/2025-10-16-plongez-dans-les-coulisses-de-prometheus-3-0/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Après sept ans d’attente, Prometheus signe une version 3.0 historique — nouvelle interface, support UTF-8, et des dizaines d’améliorations issues de la communauté.

Difference between traditional Kubernetes Controllers and Operators How Kubernetes Operators work 1. Set up a Custom Resource 2. Deploy the Operator into the Kubernetes cluster 3. Continuous monitoring of CR by the Operator. 4. Reconciliation loop: Operator compares desired vs actual state 5. Error handling Use cases of Kubernetes Operators Handling stateful apps Messaging systems Monitoring and logging stacks Automating infrastructure Why do we need Operators? Challenges without Operators Kubernetes Operators benefits Conclusion Posted on October 15, 2025 by Keval Bhogayata, Middleware CNCF projects highlighted in this post Member post originally published on the Middleware blog by Keval Bhogayata , covering Automating Stateful Apps with Kubernetes Operators. If you’ve ever had issues with scaling databases or automating upgrades in Kubernetes, Operators can help by saving you time and effort. Handling complex Kubernetes applications like databases, message queues, and distributed systems can be really difficult. Kubernetes handles simple workloads well, while big apps suffer with failover, scaling, backups, and automated updates. These activities often demand operational expertise. If you’re new to container orchestration, you may want to start by understanding the difference between Kubernetes vs Docker This is where you need Kubernetes Operators, which we’ll cover in this article.</description></item><item><title>Virtual EnvoyCon 2025</title><link>https://kubermates.org/events/2025-10-15-virtual-envoycon-2025/</link><pubDate>Wed, 15 Oct 2025 13:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/events/2025-10-15-virtual-envoycon-2025/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Virtual EnvoyCon is the go-to event for Envoy users and contributors of all levels, featuring deep technical talks, real-world insights, and community-led sessions.

It uses smart tools and practices to build, test, and ship software faster. It makes teams quicker, systems stronger and problems smaller when done right. It’s not just one thing – it’s about making the whole machine run better. But this means that DevOps is not just a toolset or process. It’s a way of thinking and a culture born from the need to fix something broken: the wall between developers and operations. Companies understand the value DevOps brings to projects – which explains why its market value is growing so fast. In 2020, it was worth about $4.3 billion. A year later, its value rose to $5.1 billion. If the pace holds, it will hit $12.2 billion by 2026. That’s almost tripled in six years. Teams understand what DevOps brings to projects.</description></item><item><title>#cTENcf Birthday Bash Luxembourg</title><link>https://kubermates.org/events/2025-10-14-ctencf-birthday-bash-luxembourg/</link><pubDate>Tue, 14 Oct 2025 16:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/events/2025-10-14-ctencf-birthday-bash-luxembourg/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Celebrate CNCF 10-year journey&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Chaos Mesh Development Meeting</title><link>https://kubermates.org/events/2025-10-14-chaos-mesh-development-meeting/</link><pubDate>Tue, 14 Oct 2025 01:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/events/2025-10-14-chaos-mesh-development-meeting/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;This is a biweekly meeting to discuss anything related to the project development.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Cloud Native Frankfurt x Grafana &amp; Friends Frankfurt</title><link>https://kubermates.org/events/2025-10-13-cloud-native-frankfurt-x-grafana-friends-frankfurt/</link><pubDate>Mon, 13 Oct 2025 15:30:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/events/2025-10-13-cloud-native-frankfurt-x-grafana-friends-frankfurt/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Cloud Native Frankfurt x Grafana &amp;amp; Friends Frankfurt are teaming up for an exciting meetup!Join us for our enlightening &amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>KubeCon + CloudNativeCon North America 2025 Co-Located Event Deep Dive: Cloud Native + Kubernetes AI Day</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-10-13-kubecon-cloudnativecon-north-america-2025-co-located-event-deep-dive-cloud-nativ/</link><pubDate>Mon, 13 Oct 2025 14:23:36 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-10-13-kubecon-cloudnativecon-north-america-2025-co-located-event-deep-dive-cloud-nativ/</guid><description>Who will get the most out of attending this event? What is new and different this year? What will the day look like? Should I do any homework first? A special note from the program chairs Posted on October 13, 2025 by Yuzhui Liu, Rajas Kakodkar, Ricardo Rocha, Yuan Tang | Co-Chairs Cloud Native &amp;amp; Kubernetes AI Day is welcoming the AI/ML and High Performance Computing (HPC) communities. Since 2022 there have been multiple dedicated events (Batch / HPC and Cloud Native AI days) but given the overlap in requirements, projects and end user interests it became clear we all fit better together. Cloud Native &amp;amp; Kubernetes AI Day brings together a diverse range of technical enthusiasts, open source contributors, practitioners, researchers and end users. All united in a common goal: enhancing Kubernetes as the ultimate infrastructure management tool for research and AI/ML workloads. The Cloud Native &amp;amp; Kubernetes AI Day is aimed at seasoned practitioners as well as those new to the batch computing and MLOps worlds. Anyone looking for solutions and best practices to provide cost effective and efficient infrastructure to scale out batch computing, training and inference workloads, make the best use of scarce and expensive hardware accelerators and efficiently manage LLMs and agentic infrastructure. This event will also help practitioners of MLOps interact with maintainers of Cloud Native AI projects and foster collaboration between the two worlds. The theme this year is ‘agent,’ with multiple references and reports on Agentic AI and the cloud native infrastructure supporting it. This event will be a unique opportunity to connect and network with people driving this new generation infrastructure. We will have a full day with 10 full sessions and 4 lightning talks and enough time for questions during the sessions and discussion in the break outs. We will be hearing from researchers, project maintainers and many end users reporting on successes and challenges of running AI/ML workloads on top of cloud native infrastructure. While the sessions will be engaging, there will be ample time during coffee breaks and lunch for hallway tracks and networking sessions, helping attendees engage with speakers, maintainers of projects and end users.</description></item><item><title>Welcome Back: Introduction to Cloud-Native Technologies</title><link>https://kubermates.org/events/2025-10-12-welcome-back-introduction-to-cloud-native-technologies/</link><pubDate>Sun, 12 Oct 2025 04:30:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/events/2025-10-12-welcome-back-introduction-to-cloud-native-technologies/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Join us for our first in-person meetup in Rajkot as we reboot Cloud Native Rajkot, where enthusiasts and professionals c&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Cloud Native Lima University #1 - UNI - Cloud Native 101</title><link>https://kubermates.org/events/2025-10-11-cloud-native-lima-university-1-uni-cloud-native-101/</link><pubDate>Sat, 11 Oct 2025 14:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/events/2025-10-11-cloud-native-lima-university-1-uni-cloud-native-101/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Únete al lanzamiento de &amp;ldquo;Cloud Native Lima University&amp;rdquo;, el evento que integra a la comunidad universitaria con la vanguardia de la tecnología.

What will the day look like? Should I do any homework first? Find your community! A note from the program chairs Posted on October 10, 2025 by Adam Durr and Melissa Logan | Co-Chairs Data on Kubernetes Day (DoK Day) began as a virtual event in 2021 and became an official co-located event for KubeCon + Cloud Native Con in 2023. Since then, it has been a staple at both the European and North American events, so we’re excited to bring it back for our community in Atlanta. Running stateful workloads like databases, streaming, AI/ML, and analytics on Kubernetes is no longer a fringe practice—it’s becoming the standard for modern infrastructure. Organizations like Etsy, Grab, and Chick-fil-A have demonstrated what’s possible. Our goal for DoK Day is to provide you with the real-world resources, best practices, and use cases you need to confidently run data workloads on Kubernetes and accelerate your journey. This year, we have seen a significant increase in content submissions focusing on AI and LLMs, reflecting the industry trend of Kubernetes becoming the foundation for AI infrastructure. Our schedule will feature several new talks on this topic, from leveraging GPUs to managing AI data pipelines on Kubernetes. We are also proud to have our most diverse group of speakers and submissions to date, representing a wide range of backgrounds and experiences from the community. DoK Day is for practitioners and decision-makers who are pushing Kubernetes beyond stateless applications. Platform engineers, SREs, data engineers, architects, and CTOs who want to understand how to run stateful workloads at scale will find immense value. Whether you’re just starting to explore running DoK or are already operating mission-critical workloads in production, you’ll walk away with practical knowledge and a stronger network of peers facing similar challenges. No formal prep is required, but we recommend attendees familiarize themselves with the Data on Kubernetes Community (DoKC) resources—such as our white papers, recorded talks, and Slack discussions.</description></item><item><title>Contribute to CNCF Glossary &amp; Kubernetes bn Localization—Maintainers Talk</title><link>https://kubermates.org/events/2025-10-10-contribute-to-cncf-glossary-kubernetes-bn-localization-maintainers-talk/</link><pubDate>Fri, 10 Oct 2025 16:30:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/events/2025-10-10-contribute-to-cncf-glossary-kubernetes-bn-localization-maintainers-talk/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Bengali localization reviewers will explain how you can contribute and hear your queries in this session.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>A blueprint for zero-trust AI on Kubernetes</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-10-10-a-blueprint-for-zero-trust-ai-on-kubernetes/</link><pubDate>Fri, 10 Oct 2025 14:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-10-10-a-blueprint-for-zero-trust-ai-on-kubernetes/</guid><description>Are these AI security challenges unique? A blueprint for securing AI on Kubernetes Securing ingress to your endpoints (secure the front door) Control the traffic (Sorry this cluster is RSVP only) Observability (What is actually happening inside the house) The bottom line Posted on October 10, 2025 by Tigera CNCF projects highlighted in this post LLMs and AI are everywhere these days. Everyone wants to build the next big thing, ship it fast, and maybe even cash out and chill for the rest of their lives. The problem? Most open source AI projects are shared as is. They’re created with the best intentions, but their developers aren’t losing sleep over things like security guardrails or production hardening, that part is left for you to figure out. If that sounds like the boat you’re in, you’re in the right place. In this blog, we’ll look at how running AI on Kubernetes introduces some very real networking and security challenges, and what you can do about them before your experiment turns into a liability. Because here’s the thing: AI systems are complicated, sometimes even the people building them admit they don’t fully know why a model makes the decision it does. But at the end of the day, it’s still just bits moving around computers and network cables, and securing those bits, whether they’re API keys, training data, or model endpoints, is easier than you might think if you know the right patterns. Yes and no. On the one hand, the issues AI workloads face, unrestricted network traffic, exposed endpoints, leaked credentials, are the same classic security problems we’ve been wrestling with in IT for decades. On the other hand, they don’t just move data around, they handle sensitive training datasets, expensive inference workloads, and powerful APIs that can be abused in seconds. A stolen API key doesn’t just mean a small breach; it could mean thousands of dollars in cloud bills or a model that starts spilling the beans for the wrong confidant.</description></item><item><title>El Regreso de Victor Recio: Una Historia de Conexión y Comunidad</title><link>https://kubermates.org/events/2025-10-10-el-regreso-de-victor-recio-una-historia-de-conexi-n-y-comunidad/</link><pubDate>Fri, 10 Oct 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/events/2025-10-10-el-regreso-de-victor-recio-una-historia-de-conexi-n-y-comunidad/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Únete a nosotros para una entrevista virtual con Victor Recio, originario de República Dominicana 🇩🇴 y Kubestronaut.La e&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Argo CD Up and Running: Applications at Scale 2/2</title><link>https://kubermates.org/events/2025-10-09-argo-cd-up-and-running-applications-at-scale-2-2/</link><pubDate>Thu, 09 Oct 2025 16:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/events/2025-10-09-argo-cd-up-and-running-applications-at-scale-2-2/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Join us for an engaging session as we delve into &amp;lsquo;Argo CD: Up and Running&amp;rsquo; by Christian Hernandez and Andrew Block.

Explore cost-effective approaches to isolate test environments without duplicating infrastructure. Asynchronous architectures have become a cornerstone of modern cloud native applications, enabling services to operate independently while maintaining system resilience and scalability. These architectures typically rely on message queues and event-driven communication patterns to decouple services, allowing them to handle varying loads and failures gracefully. Popular message systems in the cloud native ecosystem include Apache Kafka, RabbitMQ, Redis Streams, Google Cloud Pub/Sub, AWS SQS, and Azure Service Bus. Each offers unique capabilities for different use cases, from high-throughput streaming to reliable message delivery. Regardless of which system you choose, testing end-to-end workflows that span multiple services and asynchronous boundaries presents unique challenges that traditional testing approaches struggle to address effectively. This article explores how two CNCF projects—OpenTelemetry for distributed tracing and context propagation, and Istio for traffic management—can work together to create cost-effective, scalable testing environments for asynchronous workflows without the overhead of duplicating entire infrastructure stacks. Testing asynchronous systems introduces several complex challenges not found in synchronous, request-response architectures: Environment setup complexity : Asynchronous systems require multiple coordinated components—brokers, producers, consumers, and often additional infrastructure like schema registries or monitoring tools. Setting up these components correctly with proper security, replication, and partitioning requires significant expertise and time. Test isolation : Unlike synchronous calls where requests can be easily isolated, asynchronous messages in shared systems can interfere with each other. Ensuring that test data from one scenario doesn’t impact another requires careful coordination.</description></item><item><title>CNCF On-Demand: Untangling Kubernetes State Management: A tryst with Sveltos &amp; k0rdent</title><link>https://kubermates.org/events/2025-10-09-cncf-on-demand-untangling-kubernetes-state-management-a-tryst-with-sveltos-k0rde/</link><pubDate>Thu, 09 Oct 2025 07:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/events/2025-10-09-cncf-on-demand-untangling-kubernetes-state-management-a-tryst-with-sveltos-k0rde/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Meet the maintainers of Sveltos and k0rdent State Manager, Simone and Wahab who will provide a deep dive on the service management capabilities of these open source tools.

Knative removes much of the complexity of running modern workloads on Kubernetes by handling infrastructure tasks like autoscaling, routing, and event delivery. This helps organizations reduce costs, improve efficiency, and accelerate innovation. Developers gain a faster on-ramp to Kubernetes; platform teams simplify operations; and enterprises and startups alike benefit from easier integration with AI and cloud native technologies. Knative is now a graduated CNCF project and is available for production use today. SAN FRANCISCO, Calif. – October 8, 2025 – The Cloud Native Computing Foundation® (CNCF®), which builds sustainable ecosystems for cloud native software, announced the graduation of Knative , a serverless, event-driven application layer on top of Kubernetes. Knative simplifies how developers build, deploy, and run modern workloads by abstracting the infrastructure concerns such as autoscaling, routing, event delivery, and building containers. It allows teams to focus on architecture and business logic and get started quickly on Kubernetes without needing to ramp up on dozens of Kubernetes concepts and resources. As the C-suite looks to optimize costs and simplify operations, Knative can do so with features like autoscaling to zero to minimize infrastructure waste. “Knative fills several gaps in the cloud native ecosystem as an easy on-ramp to Kubernetes, with Knative’s eventing acting as the missing skeleton for connecting events to reactions,” said Evan Anderson, Knative co-founder. “It’s gratifying to see the vision that inspired Knative realized and adopted across the CNCF.</description></item><item><title>Kubernetes, Cloud Native &amp; Platform Engineering Meetup - November</title><link>https://kubermates.org/events/2025-10-08-kubernetes-cloud-native-platform-engineering-meetup-november/</link><pubDate>Wed, 08 Oct 2025 16:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/events/2025-10-08-kubernetes-cloud-native-platform-engineering-meetup-november/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;IMPORTANT:WE ARE USING LUMA FOR RSVP: &lt;a href="https://lu.ma/ksz13yy5Event"&gt;https://lu.ma/ksz13yy5Event&lt;/a&gt; Overview:Join us for an exciting evening of discussion&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Kubernetes, Cloud Native &amp; Platform Engineering Meetup - Ocotber</title><link>https://kubermates.org/events/2025-10-08-kubernetes-cloud-native-platform-engineering-meetup-ocotber/</link><pubDate>Wed, 08 Oct 2025 16:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/events/2025-10-08-kubernetes-cloud-native-platform-engineering-meetup-ocotber/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;IMPORTANT:WE ARE USING LUMA FOR RSVP: &lt;a href="https://lu.ma/0yekp6mhEvent"&gt;https://lu.ma/0yekp6mhEvent&lt;/a&gt; Overview:Join us for an exciting evening of discussion&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>A TPM-based combined remote attestation method for confidential computing</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-10-08-a-tpm-based-combined-remote-attestation-method-for-confidential-computing/</link><pubDate>Wed, 08 Oct 2025 14:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-10-08-a-tpm-based-combined-remote-attestation-method-for-confidential-computing/</guid><description>Problem statement Scenario Representative existing approaches Our solution: Hybrid attestation with TPM and TEE integration Workflow overview Implementation with Hygon CSV Advantages of the combined approach Posted on October 8, 2025 by Andy, Confidential Computing Engineer,JD. COM Confidential computing technologies such as Intel TDX and AMD SNP rely on hardware-controlled Roots of Trust (RoT), inherently binding remote attestation to specific CPU vendors. While these solutions offer strong security guarantees, they also introduce challenges for enterprises seeking compliance, transparency, and independence in managing their Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs). This raises key questions: How can organizations leverage TEE security features (e. g. , memory encryption, attestation) without being fully dependent on vendor-controlled RoT? Is it possible to partially decouple the RoT while maintaining robust security guarantees? Consider a large enterprise deploying Intel TDX or AMD SNP servers, but with a requirement that the Root of Trust (RoT) be shared with a third-party authority—such as an internal certificate authority (CA) or an industry-wide trust anchor—to enable independent verification and operational flexibility. The goal is to retain the security benefits of TEEs while mitigating vendor lock-in. Strengths: Fully vendor-agnostic and open-source. Utilizes TPM for attestation, minimizing reliance on CPU vendors. Fully vendor-agnostic and open-source. Utilizes TPM for attestation, minimizing reliance on CPU vendors. Considerations: Adopts an SGX-like, process-based isolation model, which, as of the time of this blog, may present compatibility challenges for integration with TDX/SNP ecosystems.</description></item><item><title>Karmada v1.15 Released!

With its compatibility with the native Kubernetes API, Karmada can smoothly migrate single-cluster workloads while still maintaining coordination with the surrounding Kubernetes ecosystem tools. Karmada v1.15 has been released, this version includes the following new features: Precise resource awareness for multi-template workloads Enhanced cluster-level failover functionality Structured logging Significant performance improvements for Karmada controllers and schedulers Karmada utilizes a resource interpreter to retrieve the replica count and resource requests of workloads. Based on this data, it calculates the total resource requirements of the workloads, thereby enabling advanced capabilities such as resource-aware scheduling and federated quota management. This mechanism works well for traditional single-template workloads. However, many AI and big data application workloads (e. g. , FlinkDeployments, PyTorchJobs, and RayJobs) consist of multiple Pod templates or components, each with unique resource demands. Since the resource interpreter can only process resource requests from a single template and fails to accurately reflect differences between multiple templates, the resource calculation for multi-template workloads is not precise enough. In this version, Karmada has strengthened its resource awareness for multi-template workloads. By extending the resource interpreter, Karmada can now obtain the replica count and resource requests of different templates within the same workload, ensuring data accuracy. This improvement also provides more reliable and granular data support for federated quota management of multi-template workloads.</description></item><item><title>#cTENcf Ottawa Party</title><link>https://kubermates.org/events/2025-10-07-ctencf-ottawa-party/</link><pubDate>Tue, 07 Oct 2025 22:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/events/2025-10-07-ctencf-ottawa-party/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s get together to celebrate 10 years of the CNCF!&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Cómo gestionar agentes de codificación con IA</title><link>https://kubermates.org/events/2025-10-07-c-mo-gestionar-agentes-de-codificaci-n-con-ia/</link><pubDate>Tue, 07 Oct 2025 17:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/events/2025-10-07-c-mo-gestionar-agentes-de-codificaci-n-con-ia/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;El movimiento Cloud Native proporcionó un conjunto consistente de mejores prácticas tanto para el desarrollo como para e&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Merge Forward Monthly Meeting</title><link>https://kubermates.org/events/2025-10-07-merge-forward-monthly-meeting/</link><pubDate>Tue, 07 Oct 2025 17:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/events/2025-10-07-merge-forward-monthly-meeting/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;This is the monthly Merge Forward meeting, where representatives from all Merge Forward diversity groups get together.

This creates a security and compliance gap, as malicious or unauthorized actions within a pod or on the node go unrecorded. Without this visibility, it’s impossible to fully understand user actions, conduct an incident investigation, or meet regulatory compliance requirements. The newly added audit logging feature in Security-Profiles-Operator (SPO) addresses this by enabling detailed, server-side logging of user activity at the node level. Let’s imagine a scenario: A team of engineers is responsible for maintaining an application that processes financial transactions. The application is deployed on Kubernetes, with various containers (in pods) running different workloads. When a customer reports a bug, an engineer is granted access to the pod via kubectl exec to debug the issue (also kubectl debug node). However, during the session, they accidentally delete/modify a crucial configuration file. The application fails, leading to financial losses and business disruption. During a post-incident audit, the security team can see from the Kubernetes control plane logs that the engineer initiated a kubectl exec session. But the logs don’t reveal what commands were run inside the container. It’s an operational black box.</description></item><item><title>Platform Engineering Technical Community - Biweekly Community Meetup (virtual)</title><link>https://kubermates.org/events/2025-10-07-platform-engineering-technical-community-biweekly-community-meetup-virtual/</link><pubDate>Tue, 07 Oct 2025 15:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/events/2025-10-07-platform-engineering-technical-community-biweekly-community-meetup-virtual/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Every two weeks, the Platform Engineering Technical Community members get together for guest speakers, insightful discus&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>WasmEdge Community Meeting</title><link>https://kubermates.org/events/2025-10-07-wasmedge-community-meeting/</link><pubDate>Tue, 07 Oct 2025 15:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/events/2025-10-07-wasmedge-community-meeting/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Join us for our inaugural WasmEdge Community Connect, where we leverage community creativity and innovation to strengthe&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Managing Kubernetes Workloads Using the App of Apps Pattern in ArgoCD-2</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-10-07-managing-kubernetes-workloads-using-the-app-of-apps-pattern-in-argocd-2/</link><pubDate>Tue, 07 Oct 2025 14:36:18 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-10-07-managing-kubernetes-workloads-using-the-app-of-apps-pattern-in-argocd-2/</guid><description>Posted on October 7, 2025 by Marcin Kujawski, Principal Kubernetes Engineer, Software Mind CNCF projects highlighted in this post Managing a cloud native infrastructure at scale is no longer just about deploying single applications – it’s about organizing environments, defining clear boundaries and keeping everything version-controlled, consistent, automated and easily managed within a simple and clear lifecycle process. This is where GitOps practices – tools like ArgoCD – truly shine. One of ArgoCD’s most powerful patterns is called App of Apps – a design where a single parent ArgoCD Application manages and deploys multiple child ArgoCD Applications. It brings order to potentially chaotic deployments, improves observability and aligns perfectly with GitOps methodologies. In this article, we’ll explore the App of Apps pattern in ArgoCD, including its concept, structure, pros and cons, as well as a production-grade way to configure child applications via dedicated values files. You’ll learn how to build a reusable, scalable pattern by deploying two example applications: NGINX Ingress Controller Cert-Manager Let’s dive in. What Is the App of Apps Pattern in ArgoCD? Concept The App of Apps pattern is an ArgoCD deployment strategy where one central ArgoCD Application (the “parent”) is responsible for managing and deploying several other Applications (the “children”). Each child application corresponds to a logical unit (e. g. , a microservice, controller, or platform component) and is fully managed by ArgoCD. This enables a modular, hierarchical structure – especially useful in environments where infrastructure is composed of many separate but related components. Real-World Analogy Think of the parent app as a conductor of an orchestra.</description></item><item><title>Cloud Native AI Meetup</title><link>https://kubermates.org/events/2025-10-07-cloud-native-ai-meetup/</link><pubDate>Tue, 07 Oct 2025 12:30:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/events/2025-10-07-cloud-native-ai-meetup/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Join us for our event, Kubernetes Sri Lanka: Cloud Native AI Meetup, where we explore the intersection of Kubernetes and&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>[In Person] Cloud Native Kuala Lumpur Meetup - October 2025</title><link>https://kubermates.org/events/2025-10-07-in-person-cloud-native-kuala-lumpur-meetup-october-2025/</link><pubDate>Tue, 07 Oct 2025 10:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/events/2025-10-07-in-person-cloud-native-kuala-lumpur-meetup-october-2025/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;[In Person] Cloud Native Kuala Lumpur Meetup - October 2025&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Announcing ORAS v1.3.0: Elevating artifact and registry management workflows</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-10-06-announcing-oras-v1-3-0-elevating-artifact-and-registry-management-workflows/</link><pubDate>Mon, 06 Oct 2025 17:07:15 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-10-06-announcing-oras-v1-3-0-elevating-artifact-and-registry-management-workflows/</guid><description>Your registry’s safety net: Portable backup &amp;amp; restore Multi-platform image and artifact management Enable scripting and automation: Formatted output Stability &amp;amp; user experience polish Why this release matters Thanks to all contributors Posted on October 6, 2025 by Feynman Zhou CNCF projects highlighted in this post The ORAS community is thrilled to announce the release of ORAS CLI v1.3.0, a version packed with stability improvements and pioneering capabilities. In addition to strengthening existing functionality, this release introduces three major new features designed to enhance artifact and registry management workflows: Portable backup and restore of repositories and artifacts Multi-platform image and artifact management Rich formatted output for scripting and pipelines Moreover, ORAS is now fully compliant with OCI distribution-spec v1.1.1. With oras backup and oras restore, ORAS now lets you save your registry content into local directories or tarballs (OCI image layout format) as a snapshot and restore to any registry. All manifests, along with any optional tags and referrers, will be included in the backup. Use cases include: Air-gapped environments: Organizations operating in isolated or high-security environments can use oras backup to export artifacts from a registry to the local filesystem, and oras restore to import them into an internal registry with restricted access. Disaster recovery and audit archival: Take periodic snapshots of repositories and store them off-site. In case of accidental deletions, outages, or long-term storage for regulatory audits, oras restore can quickly recover full registry content. Registry migration: When moving from one container registry provider to another, these commands enable a full repository export, preserving tags, manifests, layers, and referrers. Compliance and supply chain security: Back up and restore images along with their supply chain artifacts, such as SBOMs, signatures, and vulnerability scanning reports. Repository duplication or promotion: Move artifacts from dev to staging to production registries reliably using an intermediate backup file. Check out the user guide Backup and Restore of OCI Artifacts, Images, and Repositories for details. Multi-platform images are commonly used in IoT and Edge computing, particularly in heterogeneous deployments.</description></item><item><title>KubeCon + CloudNativeCon North America 2025 Co-Located Event Deep Dive: Open Source SecurityCon</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-10-06-kubecon-cloudnativecon-north-america-2025-co-located-event-deep-dive-open-source/</link><pubDate>Mon, 06 Oct 2025 13:14:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-10-06-kubecon-cloudnativecon-north-america-2025-co-located-event-deep-dive-open-source/</guid><description>Who will get the most out of attending this event?

Posted on October 3, 2025 by Co-chairs, Katerina Arzhayev, Gergely Csatári, and Mars Toktonaliev CNCF projects highlighted in this post The inaugural Edge Day launched as a co-located event at KubeCon + CloudNativeCon EU in 2022, recognizing that data at the edge is here to stay. Once called the ‘Internet of Things’ and later ‘Industry 4.0,’ today ‘edge computing’ has emerged as the unifying term, reflecting the evolution from centralized data centers and cloud computing to the very edge of the network. Kubernetes on Edge Day embraces this shift with a thoughtful agenda that brings together academic research, real-world enterprise use cases, and insights from peers across the Kubernetes community. This is a wonderful event for everyone who wants to get as close to the newest technology as they can, without going to a quantum computing conference 😊. Engineers working at large companies who are looking to modernize and containerize their applications will be able to explore real-world business applications of technological innovation. Students and researchers will hear from other academics on what and how they are doing to push the limits of what is typically thought to be possible. At Kubernetes on Edge Day, we bring together experts for an audience who are tackling some of the most exciting and complex problems in cloud computin today, and tomorrow. We did our best to limit the topics to stay as close to true “edge computing” as we could, but the reality is edge computing is the future that is leaking into all other categories, verticals, industries, and technologies. This year, we had submissions covering artificial intelligence at the edge, edge computing for telco deployments, the effect and importance of data on Kubernetes, the vitality of observability at scale for these systems, and many more. We hope that this year’s agenda tells an interesting story about Kubernetes at the Edge. The event will kick off in the main room with a welcome from the chairs.

Why Migrate? Fluentd vs. Fluent Bit: What are the Differences Background Performance Routing Telemetry signal focus Custom processing Custom plugins Monitoring How to get started with a Fluentd to Fluent Bit migration Deployment Deployed as an Aggregator / Collector Adding a Telemetry Pipeline Configuration Custom Plugins Custom Processing Logic Migrating Portions at a Time Conclusion Frequently Asked Questions Why migrate from Fluentd to Fluent Bit What are some differences between Fluentd and Fluent Bit? Can Fluentd and Fluent Bit work together? Posted on October 1, 2025 by Anurag Gupta | Fluent Bit Maintainer | Field Architect | Chronosphere CNCF projects highlighted in this post Fluentd was created over 14 years ago and still continues to be one of the most widely deployed technologies for log collection in the enterprise. Fluentd’s distributed plugin architecture and highly permissive licensing made it ideal as part of the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) as a now graduated project. However, enterprises drowning in telemetry data are now requiring solutions that have higher performance, more native support for evolving schemas and formats, and increased flexibility in processing. Enter Fluent Bit. Fluent Bit , while initially growing as a sub-project within the Fluent ecosystem , expanded from Fluentd to support all telemetry types – logs, metrics, and traces. Fluent Bit now is the more popular of the two with over 15 billion deployments and used by Amazon, Google, Oracle and Microsoft to name a few. Fluent Bit also is fully aligned with OpenTelemetry signals, format and protocol, which ensures that users will be able to continue handling telemetry data as it grows and evolves. Among the most frequent questions we get as the maintainers of the projects are: How do we migrate? What should we watch out for? And what business value do we get for migrating? This article aims to answer these questions with examples. We want to help make it an easy decision to migrate from Fluentd to Fluent Bit. Here is a quick list of the reasons users switch from Fluentd to Fluent Bit: Higher performance for the same resources you are already using Full OpenTelemetry support for logs, metrics, and traces as well as Prometheus support for metrics Simpler configuration and routing ability to multiple locations Higher velocity for adding custom processing rules Integrated monitoring to better understand performance and dataflows To understand all the differences between the projects, it is important to understand the background of each project and the era it was built for. With Fluentd, the main language is Ruby and initially designed to help users push data to big data platforms such as Hadoop.</description></item><item><title>Cloud Native Araraquara - Meetup #05</title><link>https://kubermates.org/events/2025-09-30-cloud-native-araraquara-meetup-05/</link><pubDate>Tue, 30 Sep 2025 22:30:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/events/2025-09-30-cloud-native-araraquara-meetup-05/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Vem aí o nosso Meetup #05No dia 30/09, às 19h30, teremos mais um encontro online e gratuito da Cloud Native Araraquara, &amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>4º Encontro Cloud Native Fortaleza - Online</title><link>https://kubermates.org/events/2025-09-30-4-encontro-cloud-native-fortaleza-online/</link><pubDate>Tue, 30 Sep 2025 22:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/events/2025-09-30-4-encontro-cloud-native-fortaleza-online/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;🚀 Vem aí o terceiro encontro da comunidade Cloud Native Fortaleza! 🎉🌊&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Cartografos Community Meeting</title><link>https://kubermates.org/events/2025-09-30-cartografos-community-meeting/</link><pubDate>Tue, 30 Sep 2025 17:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/events/2025-09-30-cartografos-community-meeting/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Bi-weekly community meeting for the Cartografos Working Group.

I recently passed it, and in this post, I want to share: Why I took the exam How I prepared (including all the resources I used) What the experience was like Whether I’d recommend it This isn’t a sales pitch. It’s a real-world guide to help you prepare — and understand whether this certification is right for you. I’ve been working with ArgoCD for over a year now as a senior cloud engineer. I’ve had first-hand experience managing real-world GitOps workflows, and designing deployment strategies using ArgoCD. However, the CAPA exam doesn’t just focus on ArgoCD. It covers four Argo projects : Argo Workflows Argo CD Argo Rollouts Argo Events While I had a solid foundation in GitOps and ArgoCD (which makes up 34% of the exam), I had little to no hands-on experience with Workflows, Rollouts, or Events — and that’s where most of my preparation efforts went. I prepared for the exam over the course of 1 month — with a focused, hands-on approach. Here’s the breakdown of how I studied and what resources I used: As a CNCF Ambassador, I had the opportunity to get the exam for free, and I also opted to purchase the “DevOps and Workflow Management with Argo (LFS256)” training course.</description></item><item><title>Chaos Mesh Development Meeting</title><link>https://kubermates.org/events/2025-09-30-chaos-mesh-development-meeting/</link><pubDate>Tue, 30 Sep 2025 01:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/events/2025-09-30-chaos-mesh-development-meeting/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;This is a biweekly meeting to discuss anything related to the project development.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Cloud Native Shakti: Women Powering Kubernetes</title><link>https://kubermates.org/events/2025-09-29-cloud-native-shakti-women-powering-kubernetes/</link><pubDate>Mon, 29 Sep 2025 14:30:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/events/2025-09-29-cloud-native-shakti-women-powering-kubernetes/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;This Navratri, join us in celebrating the power of women in technology with a special Cloud Native virtual event.

What is new and different this year? What will the day look like? Should I do any homework first? A note from the co-chairs Posted on September 29, 2025 by Co-chairs, Blair Fraser, Bryan Landes, Balaji Sivasubramanian CNCF projects highlighted in this post BackstageCon has been in existence since 2022, where it made its debut at KubeCon + CloudNativeCon North America in Detroit. We want attendees at BackstageCon to leave with a deeper understanding of the latest trends and use cases of Backstage. Last year, Backstage saw strong engagement from the end user community, with significant contributions driving its momentum. We aim to springboard from that success, by bringing together the Backstage community and sharing success stories, use cases, and the future of the Backstage project. The BackstageCon agenda is suitable for all skill levels, but we think that anyone involved in platform engineering, developer portals, or those interested in improving developer productivity will make the most out of this event. For early adopters of Backstage, this event is an excellent opportunity to learn from experienced users and contributors. Experienced Backstage users will find insights into the future of Backstage and can use this event as an excellent opportunity to network with other adopters. This year’s agenda introduces new topics, including how organizations of all sizes are scaling developer productivity using Backstage, the future of developer portals, and scaling AI development. This event will kick off in the main room with a welcome from the chairs. We have a single track agenda starting with an adopter session in scaling developer productivity. Keynote sessions from our sponsors will lead into several exciting sessions on topics from leveraging the new notification system, using scaffolder for workflows, and a panel discussion of the future of developer portals. Our afternoon will include sessions led by contributors and adopters covering topics like standardizing MCP deployment and governance, taming the post-startup stage with Backstage, and how one adopter is turning their insights into golden paths.</description></item><item><title>Running AI Agents on Kubernetes with kagent</title><link>https://kubermates.org/events/2025-09-27-running-ai-agents-on-kubernetes-with-kagent/</link><pubDate>Sat, 27 Sep 2025 09:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/events/2025-09-27-running-ai-agents-on-kubernetes-with-kagent/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Bu etkinlğimizde AI Agent kavramından, son zamanların en popüler konularından birisi olan MCP (Model Context Protocol)&amp;lsquo;den ve Agent to Agent iletişimde kullanılan A2A protokolden ayrıca bir AI Agent&amp;rsquo;ın Kubernetes ortamında kagent yardımıyla nasıl çalıştırılabileceğinden bahsedeceğiz.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Programmers Day 2025</title><link>https://kubermates.org/events/2025-09-27-programmers-day-2025/</link><pubDate>Sat, 27 Sep 2025 06:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/events/2025-09-27-programmers-day-2025/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;The developers community in Mauritius is particularly large and vibrant, spanning multiple sub-categories of the tech wo&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>#cTENcf Birthday Bash X Atlassian X AWS Jaipur</title><link>https://kubermates.org/events/2025-09-27-ctencf-birthday-bash-x-atlassian-x-aws-jaipur/</link><pubDate>Sat, 27 Sep 2025 04:30:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/events/2025-09-27-ctencf-birthday-bash-x-atlassian-x-aws-jaipur/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;#cTENcf regional events are organised by every local community group to celebrate 10 years of CNCF.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CNCG Kochi Sept Offline Meetup</title><link>https://kubermates.org/events/2025-09-27-cncg-kochi-sept-offline-meetup/</link><pubDate>Sat, 27 Sep 2025 04:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/events/2025-09-27-cncg-kochi-sept-offline-meetup/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Join us for the CNCG Kochi September Offline Meetup, The sessions are packed with cloud-native insights from experience&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Helm Templating: Despliegues al Siguiente Nivel</title><link>https://kubermates.org/events/2025-09-27-helm-templating-despliegues-al-siguiente-nivel/</link><pubDate>Sat, 27 Sep 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/events/2025-09-27-helm-templating-despliegues-al-siguiente-nivel/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Helm Templating: Despliegues al Siguiente NivelHelm es el gestor de paquetes oficial de Kubernetes y uno de los proyecto&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>The Cloud Native Sign Language Glossary: A Story of Community and Inclusion</title><link>https://kubermates.org/events/2025-09-26-the-cloud-native-sign-language-glossary-a-story-of-community-and-inclusion/</link><pubDate>Fri, 26 Sep 2025 19:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/events/2025-09-26-the-cloud-native-sign-language-glossary-a-story-of-community-and-inclusion/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;What is Kubernetes in sign language?

Ensuring consistency and data safety requires our project contributors to continuously improve testing methodologies. In this article, we describe how we use advanced simulation testing to uncover subtle bugs, validate the robustness of our releases, and increase our confidence in etcd’s stability. We’ll share our key findings and how they have improved etcd. Many critical software systems depend on etcd to be correct and consistent, most notably as the primary datastore for Kubernetes. After some issues with the v3.5 release, the etcd maintainers developed a new robustness testing framework to better test for correctness under various failure scenarios. To further enhance our testing capabilities, we integrated a deterministic simulation testing platform from Antithesis into our workflow. The platform works by running the entire etcd cluster inside a deterministic hypervisor. This specialized environment gives the testing software complete control over every source of non-determinism, such as network behavior, thread scheduling, and system clocks. This means any bug it discovers can be perfectly and reliably reproduced. Within this simulated environment, the testing methodology shifts away from traditional, scenario-based tests. Instead of writing tests imperatively with strict assertions for one specific outcome, this approach uses declarative, property-based assertions about system behavior.</description></item><item><title>Tu Compañero SRE con IA: Operaciones Inteligentes en Kubernetes con kagent</title><link>https://kubermates.org/events/2025-09-25-tu-compa-ero-sre-con-ia-operaciones-inteligentes-en-kubernetes-con-kagent/</link><pubDate>Thu, 25 Sep 2025 01:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/events/2025-09-25-tu-compa-ero-sre-con-ia-operaciones-inteligentes-en-kubernetes-con-kagent/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;¿Te imaginas tener un compañero SRE que nunca duerme, analiza patrones complejos en segundos y puede ejecutar operacione&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>OTel in Practice: How We Scaled KafkaLog Ingestion for OTel by 150%</title><link>https://kubermates.org/events/2025-09-24-otel-in-practice-how-we-scaled-kafkalog-ingestion-for-otel-by-150/</link><pubDate>Wed, 24 Sep 2025 17:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/events/2025-09-24-otel-in-practice-how-we-scaled-kafkalog-ingestion-for-otel-by-150/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Join us for what&amp;rsquo;s sure to be an insightful session, as Dakota Paasman from Bindplane shares how their team solved a cus&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Cloud Native Live: Kubernetes v1.34 Release</title><link>https://kubermates.org/events/2025-09-24-cloud-native-live-kubernetes-v1-34-release/</link><pubDate>Wed, 24 Sep 2025 16:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/events/2025-09-24-cloud-native-live-kubernetes-v1-34-release/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Similar to previous releases, the release of Kubernetes v1.34 introduces new stable, beta, and alpha features.

These changes, which will take effect by September 29, 2025 , mark a shift to a paid subscription model for Bitnami Secure Images and the removal of many free-to-use artifacts from public registries. We want to be clear: these changes do not impact the Helm project itself. Helm is a graduated project that will remain under the CNCF. It continues to be fully open source, Apache 2.0 licensed, and governed by a neutral community. The CNCF community retains ownership of all project intellectual property per our IP policy , ensuring no single vendor can alter its open governance model. While “Helm charts” refer broadly to a packaging format that anyone can use to deploy applications on Kubernetes, Bitnami Helm Charts are a specific vendor-maintained implementation. Developed and maintained by the Bitnami team (now part of Broadcom), these charts are known for their ease of use, security features, and reliability. Bitnami’s decision to deprecate its public chart and image repositories is entirely separate from the Helm project itself. Users currently depending on Bitnami Helm Charts should begin exploring migration or mirroring strategies to avoid potential disruption. The Helm community is actively working to support users during this transition, including guidance on: Updating chart dependencies Exploring alternative chart sources Migrating to maintained open image repositories We encourage users to follow the Helm blog and Helm GitHub for updates and support resources. CNCF remains committed to maintaining the integrity of our open source projects and supporting communities through transitions like this.</description></item><item><title>Local Roots, Global Reach: CNCJ Reflects on KubeCon + CloudNativeCon Japan 2025</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-09-24-local-roots-global-reach-cncj-reflects-on-kubecon-cloudnativecon-japan-2025/</link><pubDate>Wed, 24 Sep 2025 16:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-09-24-local-roots-global-reach-cncj-reflects-on-kubecon-cloudnativecon-japan-2025/</guid><description>🌏 A Landmark Gathering: KubeCon + CloudNativeCon Comes to Japan 🇯🇵 CNCJ and Japan Community Day Posted on September 24, 2025 by Masaya Aoyama, Sunyanan Choochotkaew (KubeCon+CloudNativeCon Japan 2025 Program Co-Chair, CNCJ Board) CNCF projects highlighted in this post Konnichiwa from Tokyo! 🇯🇵 In June 2025, something remarkable happened: the global cloud native community gathered in Tokyo for the first-ever KubeCon + CloudNativeCon Japan, hosted by the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) under the Linux Foundation. This wasn’t just another tech conference—it was a proud milestone for Japan’s growing open source and cloud native ecosystem. KubeCon + CloudNativeCon Japan 2025 marked the first time the CNCF’s flagship event was held on Japanese soil—bringing together a full house of 1,500 attendees from across Japan and around the world. Hosted at the Hilton Tokyo Odaiba , the event featured over 40 sessions covering the full spectrum of cloud native technologies, ranging from beginner-friendly topics and observability to AI/ML, platform engineering, connectivity, and security. The two days were packed with innovation, collaboration, and connection. Developers, maintainers, end users, and technologists of all stripes came together to share lessons learned, explore emerging trends, and dive deep into the future of open source infrastructure. In addition to technical talks, the conference emphasized community building—celebrating contributors, spotlighting regional efforts, and encouraging diverse perspectives. For many Japanese attendees, it was a rare opportunity to engage with the global cloud native ecosystem right at home. For international guests, it was a chance to experience Japan’s fast-growing tech culture firsthand. While CNCF and the Linux Foundation brought usual professionalism to organizing KubeCon + CloudNativeCon Japan, we at Cloud Native Community Japan (CNCJ) were proud to support the local community layer —bridging global expertise with Japanese voices and initiatives. One of our most successful contributions was organizing Japan Community Day , held on June 15 , just ahead of the main conference. This CNCJ-led event gathered local contributors, meetup organizers, and engineers from across Japan and from overseas.</description></item><item><title>#cTENcf Party - 10 years of CNCF and 5 years of Cloud Native Linz</title><link>https://kubermates.org/events/2025-09-24-ctencf-party-10-years-of-cncf-and-5-years-of-cloud-native-linz/</link><pubDate>Wed, 24 Sep 2025 15:30:22 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/events/2025-09-24-ctencf-party-10-years-of-cncf-and-5-years-of-cloud-native-linz/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;We&amp;rsquo;re happy to announce our next edition of our meetup where we&amp;rsquo;ll celebrate 10 years of CNCF and 5 years of our local c&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>cTENcf celebration!</title><link>https://kubermates.org/events/2025-09-24-ctencf-celebration/</link><pubDate>Wed, 24 Sep 2025 15:30:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/events/2025-09-24-ctencf-celebration/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;CNCF turns 10 and that should be celebrated - So joins us for the celebration of cTENcf and lets reminisce what has happ&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>cTENcf Montreal Party: Celebrating Cloud Native's Journey</title><link>https://kubermates.org/events/2025-09-23-ctencf-montreal-party-celebrating-cloud-native-s-journey/</link><pubDate>Tue, 23 Sep 2025 21:30:29 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/events/2025-09-23-ctencf-montreal-party-celebrating-cloud-native-s-journey/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;📢Call for Speakers is open &lt;a href="https://sessionize.com/cncf-montreal"&gt;https://sessionize.com/cncf-montreal&lt;/a&gt;.📢Join us for an unforgettable evening as we commemorate &amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>#cTENcf Birthday Bash Porto</title><link>https://kubermates.org/events/2025-09-23-ctencf-birthday-bash-porto/</link><pubDate>Tue, 23 Sep 2025 17:30:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/events/2025-09-23-ctencf-birthday-bash-porto/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s celebrate 10 years of CNCF together.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Solving Kubernetes Multi-tenancy Challenges with vCluster</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-09-23-solving-kubernetes-multi-tenancy-challenges-with-vcluster/</link><pubDate>Tue, 23 Sep 2025 16:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-09-23-solving-kubernetes-multi-tenancy-challenges-with-vcluster/</guid><description>Understanding Multi-tenancy Multi-tenancy with native Kubernetes features Control Plane Isolation Data Plane Isolation vCluster Concept Hands-on Prerequisites Deploy a virtual cluster Deploy workload Deploy a CRD Hands-on summary Interaction with host applications Falco Kyverno Implications Summary Outlook References Posted on September 23, 2025 by Fabian Brundke, Senior Platform Engineer, Liquid Reply CNCF projects highlighted in this post When we are building Internal Developer Platforms (IDP) for our customers Kubernetes is often a solid choice as the robust core of this platform. This is due to its technical capabilities and the strong community that is constantly expanding the surrounding ecosystem. One common IDP use case is to support the software development lifecycle (SDLC) of multiple tenants (e. g. multiple applications or software engineering teams). Adopting Kubernetes helps to share resources among these different tenants and while this helps to – among other benefits – optimize costs and enforce standards, it also introduces the challenge of isolating workloads from each other. This is known as multi-tenancy and for an IDP we have to ensure that this isolation is fair and secure. Thankfully Kubernetes provides a few out-of-the-box features to support isolation in a multi-tenant setup. This isolation can happen for the control plane and data plane. Let’s briefly describe these features. Namespaces are used to group different resources for tenants into logical units. While this allows you to effectively apply e.</description></item><item><title>Cloud Native Prague #26</title><link>https://kubermates.org/events/2025-09-23-cloud-native-prague-26/</link><pubDate>Tue, 23 Sep 2025 15:30:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/events/2025-09-23-cloud-native-prague-26/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Meetup topic: Kubernetes lifecycle&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Deaf and Hard of Hearing WG: Monthly Meeting</title><link>https://kubermates.org/events/2025-09-23-deaf-and-hard-of-hearing-wg-monthly-meeting/</link><pubDate>Tue, 23 Sep 2025 15:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/events/2025-09-23-deaf-and-hard-of-hearing-wg-monthly-meeting/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;This is the monthly Deaf and Hard of Hearing Working Group (DHHWG) meeting.

What is new and different this year? What will the day look like? Should I do any homework first? Meet your community! A note from co-chair Bill Mulligan: Posted on September 22, 2025 by Co-chairs: Bill Mulligan and Hemanth Malla CNCF projects highlighted in this post CiliumCon began at KubeCon + CloudNativeCon Europe 2023 in Amsterdam, and this will be our sixth time hosting it. Like Cilium itself, the event has grown significantly since its inception, expanding from its original focus to now include Hubble and Tetragon too. There might even be some nods to scaling networking for the needs of AI. CiliumCon is where the Cilium and eBPF community comes together to share real-world experiences and learn from each other. It’s a space to meet the Github handles you have been working with or following the whole year and who knows, you might even walk away with an eBee. Platform teams will walk away with the knowledge on everything from implementing Cilium Mesh in production environments to advanced DNS policy management to multi-cluster security strategies and running IPv6 only Kubernetes clusters. Seasoned contributors will learn if it’s actually possible to parse DNS in the kernel and everyone will help build the buzz around Cilium. This year, we are celebrating almost 10 years of Cilium! As the project has matured, we’re able to feature the experience of a decade of production implementations. Attendees will hear how CiliumEndpointSlice helped Microsoft unlock higher scale at AKS, SeatGeek’s journey from zero to production in 90 days with Cilium Mesh, ESnet’s pioneering IPv6-first Kubernetes deployment, and Google’s multi-cluster network security strategies with Cilium, Tetragon, and Hubble. We’re also diving deep into kernel-level DNS parsing improvements and will learn how to solve a real-world bug in Cilium’s BPF-based SNAT and its LRU eviction policy. The CIlium and eBPF community will come together for a half-day on Monday, November 10th, from 9:00 AM to 12:30 PM EST. The day will kick off with opening remarks from Program Committee Co-Chairs Bill Mulligan and Hemanth Malla, followed by six technical sessions, and a keynote from Liz Rice which will cover the broader community direction and vision.</description></item><item><title>#cTENcf Birthday Bash Hanoi 🇻🇳</title><link>https://kubermates.org/events/2025-09-21-ctencf-birthday-bash-hanoi/</link><pubDate>Sun, 21 Sep 2025 06:30:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/events/2025-09-21-ctencf-birthday-bash-hanoi/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;🎉 Celebrating 10 Years of CNCF: Join Us for a Special Anniversary Event! 🎉Hãy tham gia cùng chúng tôi trong lễ kỷ niệm đ&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Cloud Native Luanda - Meetup Setembro 2025</title><link>https://kubermates.org/events/2025-09-20-cloud-native-luanda-meetup-setembro-2025/</link><pubDate>Sat, 20 Sep 2025 18:30:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/events/2025-09-20-cloud-native-luanda-meetup-setembro-2025/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Cloud Native Luanda – Meetup Setembro 2025🗓️ Data: 20 de setembro de 2025⏰ Hora: 19h30 (Luanda)🌐 Formato: Evento online🔗&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>KCD El Salvador</title><link>https://kubermates.org/events/2025-09-20-kcd-el-salvador/</link><pubDate>Sat, 20 Sep 2025 13:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/events/2025-09-20-kcd-el-salvador/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Kubernetes Community Days El Salvador 2025 is happening on Saturday, September 20, at the Universidad Centroamericana José Simeón Cañas (UCA) in San Salvador.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>#cTENcf Birthday Bash Lagos</title><link>https://kubermates.org/events/2025-09-20-ctencf-birthday-bash-lagos/</link><pubDate>Sat, 20 Sep 2025 12:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/events/2025-09-20-ctencf-birthday-bash-lagos/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Join us for an exciting meetup as we celebrate 10 years of the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) and its tremendo&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>#cTENcf Meetup Chandigarh</title><link>https://kubermates.org/events/2025-09-20-ctencf-meetup-chandigarh/</link><pubDate>Sat, 20 Sep 2025 05:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/events/2025-09-20-ctencf-meetup-chandigarh/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Celebrating 10 years of CNCF in Tricity.Chandigarh!

Using Event and Audit Logs: Deep System Analysis 8. Using Kubernetes Dashboard and Visual Tools 9. Implementing Health Checks and Probes 10. Advanced Debugging Techniques Practical Example: Network Issue Investigation Conclusion Posted on September 19, 2025 by Keval Bhogayata, Principal Engineer at Middleware In Part 1 of our series, we explored essential Kubernetes troubleshooting techniques that help DevOps engineers diagnose and resolve common cluster and application issues effectively. However, Kubernetes environments are complex, and there’s always more to uncover. In this Part 2, we’ll dive deeper into additional troubleshooting strategies, covering advanced techniques and real-world scenarios that can save you time and prevent downtime. Whether you’re dealing with persistent pod failures, network issues, or cluster misconfigurations, these tips will equip you with the knowledge to tackle Kubernetes challenges with confidence. The PersistentVolumeClaim (PVC) Pending status is a common storage issue in Kubernetes, preventing applications from accessing persistent data. This typically results from misconfigured storage classes, missing volume provisioners, or insufficient available storage in the cluster. Start by listing all Persistent Volumes (PVs) and Persistent Volume Claims (PVCs) across all namespaces. This command provides an overview of their status, access modes, capacity, and whether they are bound: kubectl get pv,pvc &amp;ndash;all-namespaces kubectl get pv,pvc &amp;ndash;all-namespaces To further investigate an unbound PVC stuck in the Pending state, use the following command: kubectl describe pvc kubectl describe pvc Check the Events section at the bottom of the output.</description></item><item><title>KubeCon + CloudNativeCon North America 2024 Co-Located Event Deep Dive: Observability Day</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-09-19-kubecon-cloudnativecon-north-america-2024-co-located-event-deep-dive-observabili/</link><pubDate>Fri, 19 Sep 2025 13:22:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-09-19-kubecon-cloudnativecon-north-america-2024-co-located-event-deep-dive-observabili/</guid><description>What do you want attendees to get out of this event? What is new and different this year? What will the day look like? Should I do any homework first? Meet your community! Posted on September 19, 2025 by Co-chairs: Eduardo Silva, Austin Parker and Juraci Paixão Kröhling Observability Day traces its roots back to KubeCon Europe 2022 in Valencia, where we hosted FluentCon, a co-located event dedicated exclusively to the Fluentd and Fluent Bit projects. The gathering was a success, and the feedback we received from the community made it clear that we could serve the broader observability space at KubeCon in an even bigger way. To make that happen, we expanded our focus and invited other CNCF projects to join. Just a few months later, at KubeCon US 2022, we introduced Open Observability Day, bringing together maintainers and community members from projects such as Jaeger, Fluentd, Thanos, Prometheus, and OpenTelemetry. The response was overwhelmingly positive, and it quickly became clear that this effort needed to evolve into something more formal and structured. Working closely with the CNCF, that vision became reality—and Observability Day was officially born We want attendees to know that Observability Day is a community-driven gathering where practitioners, end users, and project maintainers come together to shape the future of observability. It’s not just about one tool or project, it’s about learning from each other, sharing best practices, and exploring how the CNCF ecosystem works together to solve real-world challenges. Whether you’re new to observability or deeply involved in projects like Prometheus, Fluent Bit, Jaeger, Thanos, or OpenTelemetry, you’ll leave with practical insights, valuable connections, and a clearer picture of where the space is heading. Most importantly, this is your chance to directly engage with the people building the tools you use every day. What’s new this year is the breadth and depth of community-driven content. Observability Day 2025 puts CNCF projects front and center, with maintainers and practitioners sharing the latest updates and lessons learned. You’ll find talks that go beyond theory—covering real-world scaling challenges, cost-efficient monitoring strategies, and new frontiers like AI observability There’s also a stronger emphasis on OpenTelemetry in action, from rapid adoption patterns to advanced use cases in telco, mobile, and enterprise systems.</description></item><item><title>2025: Lo que nos espera en KCD El Salvador - Spoilers y Q&amp;A</title><link>https://kubermates.org/events/2025-09-19-2025-lo-que-nos-espera-en-kcd-el-salvador-spoilers-y-q-a/</link><pubDate>Fri, 19 Sep 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/events/2025-09-19-2025-lo-que-nos-espera-en-kcd-el-salvador-spoilers-y-q-a/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Únase a nosotros para un evento virtual exclusivo donde exploraremos las emocionantes expectativas para KCD El Salvador &amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Cloud Native PDX: Kubernetes, Containerization &amp; Operators</title><link>https://kubermates.org/events/2025-09-19-cloud-native-pdx-kubernetes-containerization-operators/</link><pubDate>Fri, 19 Sep 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/events/2025-09-19-cloud-native-pdx-kubernetes-containerization-operators/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Come out and join us to network with local cloud native peers.Agenda:5:00pm to 5:30pm – Pizza and Networking!

What is new with Kyverno this year? What will the day look like? Should I do any homework first? Find your community! A special note from the chairs : Posted on September 15, 2025 by Co-chairs: Jim Bugwadia &amp;amp; Cortney Nickerson CNCF projects highlighted in this post This is the very first KyvernoCon ! While Kyverno has been part of the CNCF since November 2020, and has had a strong presence at past KubeCon events through policy as code focused talks, maintainer sessions, and community meetups, this is the first time our community is gathering under one roof for a dedicated event. Kubernetes has become the standard for cloud native and AI/ML workloads, and large organizations need to automate security and compliance. Hence, there is a critical need and growing awareness for policy as code. Over the past few years, Kyverno has matured significantly, becoming the most widely adopted CNCF policy engine. As we work towards becoming a graduated project and are continuing to incorporate new capabilities like CEL-based policies and a growing set of integrations across the ecosystem, the timing felt right to create a space where users, contributors, and platform teams can learn, share, and shape the future of policy as code together. KyvernoCon is designed for anyone building or running Kubernetes platforms, but especially valuable for: Organizations running Kubernetes at scale and for mission critical software, who are looking for unified governance across clusters, pipelines, and cloud. Platform engineers and SREs who want to leverage policy as code into day-to-day workflows for automated and secure delivery practices, cost savings, and a better overall developer experience. Security and compliance teams looking for practical ways to enforce standards and reduce risk. Developers and operators who want to understand how policy can improve reliability and speed. Adopters, contributors, and open-source enthusiasts eager to collaborate and shape Kyverno’s next chapter.

&lt;li&gt;Fixing CrashLoopBackOff Errors in Pods 2. Kubernetes Troubleshooting Deployment Failures: ImagePullBackOff 3. Kubernetes Troubleshooting: Fixing NotReady Node Errors 4. Diagnosing Service and Networking Problems: The Pending Error 5. Kubernetes Troubleshooting High Resource Usage: Solving OOMKilled Errors Using Monitoring and Tracing Tools Posted on September 12, 2025 by Keval Bhogayata, Principal Engineer at Middleware Member post originally published on the Middleware blog by Keval Bhogayata , covering the top 10 Kubernetes Troubleshooting Techniques. Regardless of its popularity, there can be times where even the most seasoned DevOps engineers must troubleshoot Kubernetes. While it excels at handling containerised applications at scale, it can present unique troubleshooting challenges. In this post, we’ll explore the top 10 Kubernetes troubleshooting techniques that every DevOps engineer should master. These K8s troubleshooting tips come from real-world scenarios, showing how to solve common and critical Kubernetes issues quickly and reliably. One of the most common and frustrating issues in Kubernetes is when a pod repeatedly crashes during restarts; a situation known as the CrashLoopBackOff error. This occurs when a container fails to start correctly, and Kubernetes continually attempts to restart it, resulting in a loop of failures.&lt;/li&gt;

What is new and different this year? What will the day look like? Should I do any homework first? Thanks to the community! Posted on September 12, 2025 by Chair: Sebastian Stadil CNCF projects highlighted in this post OpenTofu Day is the best place to connect with the OpenTofu community. It’s a fantastic place to talk shop with other infrastructure or platform engineers, trade stories, discuss best practices, and maybe even hire / be hired. OpenTofu is the open source continuation of Hashicorp® Terraform™. The very first of these events was in 2024 at KubeCon in Paris. It was an incredible place to start! The OpenTofu Day schedule is built around the assumption that the audience has prior experience with OpenTofu, Terraform, or other infrastructure as code. Having this experience is not required to attend, but it will definitely help to get the most out of the event. As such, it is best for DevOps engineers, platform engineers, and infrastructure leadership, especially for those looking to migrate from Terraform in 2026. This year we focus less on what it took to get the project off the ground, and more on what is in store for the community, and sharing community experiences with the project in production. The event kicks off with a summary of the progress of the project, new features, growth, and new additions to the core team. Then we have the devs expand on that with a live panel, followed by community members sharing their experiences and learned lessons with the project. It would be best if you have already downloaded and used OpenTofu. What’s more, if you migrated from Terraform.</description></item><item><title>De ARM a x86: Construyendo Aplicaciones Multi-Arquitectura con Cloud Native Buildpacks</title><link>https://kubermates.org/events/2025-09-11-de-arm-a-x86-construyendo-aplicaciones-multi-arquitectura-con-cloud-native-build/</link><pubDate>Thu, 11 Sep 2025 23:30:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/events/2025-09-11-de-arm-a-x86-construyendo-aplicaciones-multi-arquitectura-con-cloud-native-build/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Esta charla presenta un enfoque práctico y funcional para implementar builds multi-arquitectura utilizando Cloud Native Buildpacks (CNB), eliminando la complejidad tradicional de gestionar diferentes Dockerfiles y pipelines de CI/CD.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>#6 Meetup Cloud Native Goiânia</title><link>https://kubermates.org/events/2025-09-11-6-meetup-cloud-native-goi-nia/</link><pubDate>Thu, 11 Sep 2025 22:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/events/2025-09-11-6-meetup-cloud-native-goi-nia/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;A comunidade Cloud Native Goiânia convida você para nosso meetup que acontecerá no dia 11 de setembro de 2025, em format&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>[CNCF-NBG v20] Expand the observable universe and going beyond Kaniko</title><link>https://kubermates.org/events/2025-09-11-cncf-nbg-v20-expand-the-observable-universe-and-going-beyond-kaniko/</link><pubDate>Thu, 11 Sep 2025 16:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/events/2025-09-11-cncf-nbg-v20-expand-the-observable-universe-and-going-beyond-kaniko/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;We&amp;rsquo;d like to warmly invite you to another CNCF Meetup!This time hosting:Felix Dreissig and Severin Neumann who will talk&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Argo CD Up and Running: Security</title><link>https://kubermates.org/events/2025-09-11-argo-cd-up-and-running-security/</link><pubDate>Thu, 11 Sep 2025 16:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/events/2025-09-11-argo-cd-up-and-running-security/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Join us for an engaging session as we delve into &amp;lsquo;Argo CD: Up and Running&amp;rsquo; by Christian Hernandez and Andrew Block.

Posted on September 9, 2025 by Co-chairs: Fatih Degirmenci &amp;amp; Denis Jannot CNCF projects highlighted in this post November 10, 2025 Atlanta, Georgia Istio Day is the biannual community event for the industry’s most widely adopted and feature rich service mesh, where attendees will find lessons learned from running Istio in production, the latest updates on Istio’s ambient mode developments, and the opportunity to meet and learn from maintainers across the Istio ecosystem. This will be the fourth Istio Day. The first Istio Day was co-located with KubeCon Europe 2023, in Amsterdam. This colocated event replaces ServiceMeshCon, which was first held in 2019, before Istio was a CNCF project. Everyone from newcomers to seasoned professionals will benefit from this event. Whether you’re just starting with Istio or have extensive experience, you’ll gain new insights, discover emerging trends, and have the opportunity to engage directly with industry experts and fellow practitioners. This year, we’ve curated a selection of topics that provide fresh and diverse perspectives on Istio. The event features new voices, emerging technologies, and real-world use cases that reflect the latest industry trends, offering attendees valuable insights they won’t find elsewhere. The event will begin with a welcome from the chairs, followed by a series of technical sessions covering various aspects of Istio, including case studies, new features, and practical recipes. Throughout the event, there will be dedicated breaks for coffee and networking, giving attendees the chance to connect with speakers and fellow practitioners. The event will conclude with closing remarks summarizing key takeaways. Attendees are encouraged to familiarize themselves with the basics of Istio and review the schedule to identify sessions of interest.</description></item><item><title>CloudCon Sydney</title><link>https://kubermates.org/events/2025-09-08-cloudcon-sydney/</link><pubDate>Mon, 08 Sep 2025 22:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/events/2025-09-08-cloudcon-sydney/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Don’t miss CloudCon Sydney – happening 9/10 September 2025!

But with this growth comes an urgent need to prioritise cybersecurity because ignoring security risks in an AI-driven landscape can leave businesses vulnerable to sophisticated threats. Cybersecurity isn’t about relying on a single tool but rather building layered defences. A strategic combination of firewalls, encryption, and advanced threat detection systems can significantly reduce cyber risks while ensuring your organisation runs smoothly. When security is effectively managed, uncertainty is reduced, and your organisation can operate with confidence, allowing you to focus on what truly matters: scaling your business, driving innovation, and staying ahead of the competition. This article explores key cybersecurity tools and how they work together to build a robust security strategy. Whether you’re looking to enhance your existing defences or implement new solutions, these insights will help you strengthen your organisation’s security posture. Cybersecurity is no longer just an IT concern, but rather a boardroom priority. With AI-driven cyber threats no longer limited to generic phishing emails or outdated malware, today’s attacks are smarter, more precise, and alarmingly convincing. In 2023, Darktrace reported a staggering 135% increase in social engineering attacks. These aren’t just your average phishing attempts – they’re highly targeted, AI-generated, and built to exploit human trust.

It’s a tried-and-tested solution for managing containerized workloads, but AI workloads are a different beast. Here’s a rundown of what you should think about—and which tools can help—when running AI workloads in cloud-native environments. GenAI Workloads Need Event-Driven Infrastructure GenAI features often hinge on user prompts, streaming data, or background jobs. That means you need infrastructure that’s reactive, scalable, and lean. Knative Serving : Great for HTTP-based GenAI services (like LLM APIs). It automatically scales up when requests come in, and scales to zero when they don’t. Perfect for saving money on GPU-bound workloads. KEDA : Adds event-driven autoscaling based on external sources like Kafka, RabbitMQ, or Prometheus. It complements Knative by widening the scope of what can trigger scaling. Together, they give you a nimble setup that reacts fast and keeps infra costs manageable. Things to consider when serving LLMs in Cloud-Native Environments Cloud-native tooling provides robust building blocks to tackle the considerations below.</description></item><item><title>Infrastructure as Code (IaC): One of the Key Pillars of DevOps Process Automation</title><link>https://kubermates.org/events/2025-09-05-infrastructure-as-code-iac-one-of-the-key-pillars-of-devops-process-automation/</link><pubDate>Fri, 05 Sep 2025 13:30:43 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/events/2025-09-05-infrastructure-as-code-iac-one-of-the-key-pillars-of-devops-process-automation/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Infrastructure as Code (IaC) is one of the key pillars of DevOps process automation, enabling teams to define and manage&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CNCJ: コーディングエージェント × セキュリティ ミートアップ</title><link>https://kubermates.org/events/2025-09-05-cncj/</link><pubDate>Fri, 05 Sep 2025 09:30:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/events/2025-09-05-cncj/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;コーディングエージェントのセキュリティに焦点を当てたミートアップを開催します。&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Alvin Estrada: La historia detrás del hombre.</title><link>https://kubermates.org/events/2025-09-05-alvin-estrada-la-historia-detr-s-del-hombre/</link><pubDate>Fri, 05 Sep 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/events/2025-09-05-alvin-estrada-la-historia-detr-s-del-hombre/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Únete a nosotros en un encuentro especial con Alvin Estrada, un líder destacado en el ámbito de Cloud Native y community&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Conversatorio: Open Source, Docker y Cloud Native con la comunidad: Q&amp;A, oportunidades y crecimiento profesional y personal</title><link>https://kubermates.org/events/2025-09-04-conversatorio-open-source-docker-y-cloud-native-con-la-comunidad-q-a-oportunidad/</link><pubDate>Thu, 04 Sep 2025 23:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/events/2025-09-04-conversatorio-open-source-docker-y-cloud-native-con-la-comunidad-q-a-oportunidad/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Descubrirás las oportunidades que ofrecen el Open Source y el ecosistema Cloud Native para impulsar tu desarrollo profesional; además, abordaremos la importancia de las habilidades blandas, el equilibrio entre vida y trabajo y el crecimiento personal, en una experiencia pensada para aprender, inspir&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Argo CD Up and Running: Multi-Tenancy</title><link>https://kubermates.org/events/2025-09-04-argo-cd-up-and-running-multi-tenancy/</link><pubDate>Thu, 04 Sep 2025 16:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/events/2025-09-04-argo-cd-up-and-running-multi-tenancy/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Join us for an engaging session as we delve into &amp;lsquo;Argo CD: Up and Running&amp;rsquo; by Christian Hernandez and Andrew Block.

The same week, another team spent an entire night hunting phantom load balancer bugs when a certificate rotation had broken mobile clients with certificate pinning. These aren’t stories about incompetent engineers. These are stories about brilliant people falling into the same cognitive trap that catches everyone: diving deep instead of looking broad. Here’s what happened with the kubectl disaster. The symptoms looked serious: cron jobs failing, secrets not updating across namespaces, image pulls crashing left and right. Classic distributed systems chaos, right? The team immediately went into full forensic mode. Pod logs. RBAC permissions. Service account configurations.

But what about the underlying nodes themselves, the very foundation on which our workloads run? The attack surface that Kubernetes nodes expose is vast and, if left unprotected, can become a golden ticket for malicious actors. Cilium host firewall is built to lock down the host network namespace with precision, visibility, and control, extending the same familiar declarative Kubernetes network policy model to the underlying host. In this blog post, we’ll explore what Cilium Host Firewall is, how it works, and why it should be a core part of your Kubernetes security. Kubernetes native network policies don’t apply to host-level traffic. This means any communication that enters or leaves the host directly (for example, SSH, kubelet, or external monitoring agents) is largely invisible to traditional Kubernetes policy enforcement. While some firewalling is possible via firewalld or external systems, managing those rules is brittle and lacks integration with Kubernetes. At its core, this is the problem Cilium Host Firewall solves. Leveraging eBPF, Cilium introduces host firewalling directly into the fabric of the cluster. Cilium treats the node as a special type of endpoint with the label reserved:host. This lets us apply policies just like we would for pods, except these apply to traffic to and from the node(s) themselves. Cilium host firewall operates at the interface level.</description></item><item><title>Fall Kickoff at UW-Madison</title><link>https://kubermates.org/events/2025-09-02-fall-kickoff-at-uw-madison/</link><pubDate>Tue, 02 Sep 2025 22:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/events/2025-09-02-fall-kickoff-at-uw-madison/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Big congrats to UW–Madison for being named to LinkedIn’s inaugural Top Colleges list for long-term career success—perfec&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Beyond Terraform Modules: Infrastructure Design by Contract</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-09-02-beyond-terraform-modules-infrastructure-design-by-contract/</link><pubDate>Tue, 02 Sep 2025 17:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-09-02-beyond-terraform-modules-infrastructure-design-by-contract/</guid><description>The Hidden Tax of Module Stitching Four Pillars of Infrastructure Design by Contract 1.

You’re staring at a failed deployment pipeline, trying to figure out why your EKS cluster can’t find the right subnets. You’ve checked the variables, verified the outputs, and triple-checked your depends_on statements. Everything looks correct, yet it still fails. This scenario plays out daily across organizations that have adopted Terraform. While modules promised composable, reusable infrastructure, the reality has become a complex web of string-matching, implicit dependencies, and tribal knowledge. How much of your team’s time is spent debugging module connections rather than delivering value? Every time a team provisions infrastructure for a new service or application, they pay an invisible tax in cognitive overhead: For each input a module needs, someone must make critical decisions: Is this value a hard-coded constant? A data lookup? An output from another module? The answer differs for every project and environment, so this decision tree must be rebuilt from scratch each time.</description></item><item><title>Cartografos Community Meeting</title><link>https://kubermates.org/events/2025-09-02-cartografos-community-meeting/</link><pubDate>Tue, 02 Sep 2025 17:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/events/2025-09-02-cartografos-community-meeting/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Bi-weekly community meeting for the Cartografos Working Group.

Half a decade ago, we celebrated Jaeger’s fifth anniversary , marveling at its growth from a nascent idea to a critical component in the observability stack. Today, as we mark 10 years, we’re not just celebrating longevity; we’re celebrating a profound evolution. Jaeger has been reborn, embracing a future built on collaboration, standardization, and the incredible momentum of OpenTelemetry. For years, the most significant barrier to adopting distributed tracing wasn’t the backend. It was instrumentation. Getting telemetry data out of applications was a complex, often proprietary, and labor-intensive process. Every tracing system had its own SDKs, its own agents, and its own way of doing things. This fragmentation created vendor lock-in and a steep learning curve, hindering widespread adoption. This is where OpenTelemetry changed everything. It didn’t just offer another SDK; it advanced the entire practice of instrumentation. By providing a single, vendor-neutral standard, OpenTelemetry unified both manual instrumentation (SDKs) and automatic instrumentation (agents).</description></item><item><title>Unlocking Platform Engineering for Organizational Success and The Journey to the Beginning of the Edge with Talos Kubernetes</title><link>https://kubermates.org/events/2025-09-01-unlocking-platform-engineering-for-organizational-success-and-the-journey-to-the/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Sep 2025 14:30:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/events/2025-09-01-unlocking-platform-engineering-for-organizational-success-and-the-journey-to-the/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Join us for an exciting evening where we dive into two transformative topics:First, discover the world of Team Topologie&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>#cTENcf Birthday Bash Ranchi</title><link>https://kubermates.org/events/2025-08-31-ctencf-birthday-bash-ranchi/</link><pubDate>Sun, 31 Aug 2025 13:30:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/events/2025-08-31-ctencf-birthday-bash-ranchi/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Celebrating the 10th year of CNCF Communities and the CNCF LandscapeThis edition is extra special — we’re celebrating 10&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>#cTENcf party - USAC - 10 años de CNCF</title><link>https://kubermates.org/events/2025-08-30-ctencf-party-usac-10-a-os-de-cncf/</link><pubDate>Sat, 30 Aug 2025 17:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/events/2025-08-30-ctencf-party-usac-10-a-os-de-cncf/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Celebrate 10 years of CNCF!, Nuestra comunidad esta celebrando los 10 años de CNCF, 10 años, 200 proyectos y más de 275000 contribuidores, únete a nosotros en la USAC para celebrar juntos.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Announcing Kyverno Release 1.15!</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-08-30-announcing-kyverno-release-1-15/</link><pubDate>Sat, 30 Aug 2025 13:31:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-08-30-announcing-kyverno-release-1-15/</guid><description>TL;DR New Policy Types MutatingPolicy: Flexible Resource Transformation GeneratingPolicy: Intelligent Resource Creation DeletingPolicy: Controlled Cleanup Made Easy Pod Security Standard(PSS) Policy Performance: ClusterPolicy vs ValidatingPolicy Key Performance Improvements Why It Matters New OpenReports API Group Support Community &amp;amp; Contributions Getting Started What’s Next? Conclusion Posted on August 30, 2025 by The Kyverno Team CNCF projects highlighted in this post Kyverno 1.15 makes Kubernetes policy management more powerful, extensible, and user-friendly. We are thrilled to announce the release of Kyverno 1.15.0, continuing our mission to make policy management in Kubernetes environments more modular, performant, and user-friendly. This release introduces new capabilities across multiple policy types, enhances testing and CLI functionality, and brings many improvements that a vibrant community has contributed. New MutatingPolicy for dynamic resource transformation with native Kubernetes integration New GeneratingPolicy for intelligent resource creation and synchronization using CEL expressions New DeletingPolicy resource for controlled cleanup of Kubernetes resources Advanced CEL functions and enhanced policy exception support for fine-grained control Community milestone: over 850 changes merged from 70+ contributors, including many first-timers! Building on the foundation of ValidatingPolicy and ImageValidatingPolicy from previous releases, Kyverno 1.15 introduces three new CEL-based policy types that complete our comprehensive policy ecosystem. While Kyverno, created by Nirmata, maintains its traditional policy engine capabilities, these new policy types provide native Kubernetes integration by automatically converting to Kubernetes admission controllers – MutatingPolicy converts to MutatingAdmissionPolicy (MAP) and ValidatingPolicy converts to ValidatingAdmissionPolicy (VAP). This hybrid approach gives users the flexibility to choose between Kyverno’s rich policy engine features and native Kubernetes performance. The new MutatingPolicy type provides native Kubernetes integration through MutatingAdmissionPolicy, offering: Full support for all functions that a mutate rule of a traditional policy supports Easier for each loop iteration with CEL’s map() and filter() functions Full support of advanced custom CEL libraries for complex policy logic CLI support for offline resources mutation in CI/CD pipelines Here is an example of adding default labels to deployments.

But despite collecting more logs, metrics, and traces than ever before, teams are still struggling to answer the most basic questions during incidents: What broke? Where? And why? In my recent talk at OpenTelemetry Community Day, “ T he Signal in the Storm: Practical Strategies for Managing Telemetry Overload ,” I laid out a different path forward, one focused not on volume, but on meaning. More telemetry doesn’t guarantee more understanding. In many cases, it gives you the illusion of control while silently eroding your ability to reason about the system. That illusion becomes expensive, especially when telemetry pipelines are optimized for ingestion, not insight. Observability Needs a Better Model Traditional observability relies on emitting and aggregating raw signals (spans, logs, and metrics), then querying across that pile post-hoc. That model assumes the data will be useful after something goes wrong. But today’s distributed, dynamic, multi-tenant AI-driven systems don’t give you that luxury. The cost of collecting all raw signals without semantics and without context is too high. We need a shift: from streams of telemetry to structured, semantic representations of how systems behave. That starts by modeling the actual components of the system (entities) and the relationships between them. Not as metadata bolted onto spans, but as first-class signals.</description></item><item><title>Building a Scalable, Flexible, Cloud-Native GenAI Platform with Open Source Solutions</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-08-28-building-a-scalable-flexible-cloud-native-genai-platform-with-open-source-soluti/</link><pubDate>Thu, 28 Aug 2025 23:57:26 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-08-28-building-a-scalable-flexible-cloud-native-genai-platform-with-open-source-soluti/</guid><description>Core Architecture: Two-Tier Gateway Design ​ Tier One Gateway ​ Tier Two Gateway ​ Design Benefits ​ Routing and Traffic Management ​ Self-Hosted Model Serving with KServe ​ Observability, Control, and Optimization for Production Readiness ​ Observability ​ Control ​ Optimization ​ Pluggable and Flexible ​ Summary ​ Posted on August 28, 2025 by Takeshi Yoneda, Envoy Maintainer and Open Source Software Engineer at Tetrate AI workloads are complex, and unmanaged complexity kills velocity. Your architecture is the key to mastering it. As generative AI (GenAI) becomes foundational to modern software products, developers face a chaotic new reality, juggling different APIs from various providers while also attempting to deploy self-hosted open-source models. This leads to credential sprawl, inconsistent security policies, runaway costs, and an infrastructure that is difficult to scale and govern. Your architecture doesn’t have to be this complex. Platform engineering teams need a secure, scalable way to serve both internal and external LLMs to their users. That’s where tools such as Envoy AI Gateway come in. This reference architecture outlines how to build a flexible GenAI platform using the open source solutions Envoy AI Gateway, KServe, and complementary tools. Whether you’re self-hosting models or integrating with model-serving services on cloud providers, such as OpenAI and Anthropic, this architecture enables a unified, governable interface for LLM traffic. The foundation of this platform is a Two-Tier Gateway Architecture: Deployed in a centralized Gateway Cluster. It serves as the main API traffic entry point for client applications.

While a variety of high level tools like Large Language Models (LLMs) already exist to support generic use cases, many domain specific solutions are either not yet available or come with significant development costs and risks, particularly when targeting more niche problems. This raises an important challenge: how can we avoid building a fragmented AI tooling landscape with limited real world applicability? To truly support the next wave of AI innovation, especially in cloud native environments, we need to rethink and reinforce our software component foundation. This includes standardizing formats, improving cross platform interoperability, and evolving Kubernetes with AI native features in mind. One of the most promising developments in this space revolves around Open Container Initiative (OCI) artifacts. OCI artifacts enable users to store and distribute arbitrary files and metadata using OCI compliant container registries. While originally used for generic purposes (like ORAS supports them), they’re now finding critical roles in AI/ML workflows, especially with the rise of specifications like the CNCF ModelPack. The CNCF ModelPack Specification builds on top of OCI artifacts and aims to standardize the packaging, distribution, and execution of AI models in cloud native environments. By moving away from proprietary formats, ModelPack facilitates reproducibility, portability, and vendor neutrality in machine learning workflows. This opens the door to several important use cases: Standardized AI/ML model packaging : With OCI artifacts, models can be versioned, distributed, and tracked like container images. This promotes consistency and traceability across environments. Secure model delivery : Well established solutions like sigstore signatures offer mechanisms to sign and verify OCI artifacts, improving model integrity and trustworthiness.</description></item><item><title>Use Envoy Gateway as the Unified Ingress Gateway and Waypoint Proxy for Ambient Mesh</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-08-26-use-envoy-gateway-as-the-unified-ingress-gateway-and-waypoint-proxy-for-ambient-/</link><pubDate>Tue, 26 Aug 2025 13:09:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-08-26-use-envoy-gateway-as-the-unified-ingress-gateway-and-waypoint-proxy-for-ambient-/</guid><description>Why use Envoy Gateway with Ambient Mesh? How Envoy Gateway Works in Ambient Mesh? Setting Up Envoy Gateway as the Ingress Gateway Enabling Envoy Gateway as the Waypoint Proxy Should You Use Envoy Gateway with Ambient Mesh? What’s Next? References Posted on August 26, 2025 by Huabing (Robin) Zhao, Software Engineer &amp;amp; Ric Hincapié, DevOps and Support Engineer at Tetrate In this article, we’ll look at how you can use Envoy Gateway , an Envoy project open source solution, together with Istio when running in Ambient mode. This allows you to easily leverage the power of Envoy’s L7 capabilities for Ingress and east-west traffic in your mesh with easy-to-use CRDs. To understand how this integration works, let’s first take a quick look at Ambient Mesh itself. Also known as Istio Ambient mode , it’s a sidecar-less service mesh architecture that aims to simplify deployments and can boost efficiency for specific use cases. Unlike sidecar-based meshes, Ambient splits the data plane into two key components: the ztunnel , which secures service-to-service communication, and the Waypoint Proxy , which handles Layer 7 traffic routing and policy enforcement. On the other side, Envoy Gateway is a Kubernetes-native API gateway built on top of Envoy Proxy. It’s designed to work seamlessly with the Kubernetes Gateway API and takes a batteries-included approach—offering built-in support for authentication, authorization, rate limiting, CORS handling, header manipulation, and more. These capabilities are exposed through familiar Kubernetes-style APIs, letting you fully tap into Envoy’s power without needing complex configurations. Because both Ambient Mesh and Envoy Gateway are built on top of Envoy, they share a common foundation. This makes integration straightforward and allows Envoy Gateway to act as both the Ingress Gateway and Waypoint Proxy —giving you a consistent and powerful way to manage traffic and apply Layer 7 policies across your mesh. While Ambient Mesh simplifies service mesh operations by removing sidecars, its feature set doesn’t yet match the maturity of the sidecar-based model. Some advanced Layer 7 capabilities are either missing, considered experimental, or require extra complexity to configure in native Ambient mode.</description></item><item><title>How Should Prometheus Handle OpenTelemetry Resource Attributes? – A UX Research Report</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-08-25-how-should-prometheus-handle-opentelemetry-resource-attributes-a-ux-research-rep/</link><pubDate>Mon, 25 Aug 2025 19:42:02 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-08-25-how-should-prometheus-handle-opentelemetry-resource-attributes-a-ux-research-rep/</guid><description>Project background Research approach User interviews insights Survey insights What I didn’t expect to learn (but did) Recommended solutions Short-term solutions Long-term vision Acknowledgments What’s next for me Posted on August 25, 2025 by Victoria Nduka, User Experience Designer CNCF projects highlighted in this post On May 29th, 2025, I wrapped up my mentorship with Prometheus through the Linux Foundation Mentorship Program. My project focused on understanding how Prometheus handles OpenTelemetry resource attributes and how that experience could be improved for users. My job was to conduct user research to get the user perspective on this challenge. In three months, I conducted user and stakeholder interviews, ran a survey, and analyzed the findings. In this article, I’ll share how I conducted the research, what I uncovered and where the communities involved could go from here. OpenTelemetry (OTel) has something called a resource attribute, which is extra information about the source of a metric, like the service, host, or environment that generated it. Prometheus, a time-series database, uses labels to identify and query metrics. If resource attributes are converted to labels, they can cause what’s known as “a cardinality explosion”, essentially creating too many unique combinations that overwhelm the system. This usually happens if the attributes change often or include a lot of unique values, like user IDs or pod names. Currently, there are three main approaches to handling this challenge: Map all resource attributes to labels: This creates cardinality explosion problems, especially for applications with large numbers of attributes or frequently changing attribute values. Selective promotion: Users manually choose which resource attributes are important enough to be converted to labels in Prometheus. Target info pattern: Put all resource attributes in a separate metric called target_info.</description></item><item><title>How I Team Up with GenAI to Craft Conference Talk Proposals</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-08-22-how-i-team-up-with-genai-to-craft-conference-talk-proposals/</link><pubDate>Fri, 22 Aug 2025 20:09:07 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-08-22-how-i-team-up-with-genai-to-craft-conference-talk-proposals/</guid><description>An Incomplete List of GenAI Tells My Process Step One: Brainstorm Buddy Step Two: Shape the Story Step Three: Write the Abstract Prompt 1: Brainstorm Buddy Prompt 2: Shape the Story Prompt 3: Write the Abstract Enjoy the Result!

References Posted on August 22, 2025 by Whitney Lee, CNCF Ambassador and Senior Technical Advocate at Datadog TL;DR: GenAI can help you write conference abstracts, but if you use it without injecting your own curiosity and humanness, reviewers can tell. This post walks through my personal process for co-writing abstracts with GenAI in a way that preserves my voice and experience. I developed this process for technical talks, but it adapts well to other formats too. I’ve spoken at a lot of conferences, big and small. I’ve given keynotes. Breakouts. Workshops. I’ve been around the block and written many conference talk proposals. I’ve also been on program committees and reviewed others’ proposals. There’s always room for improvement, but I like to think I know what good is. In my view, here are some elements of a good talk proposal: – A clear, engaging idea (or a run-of-the-mill idea with a compelling angle) – Some clear details about the talk, like concrete examples or stories, or talk format and tools covered – Clear audience – Clear takeaways As you can imagine, the widespread use of GenAI to generate talk proposals has changed the game for both submitters and reviewers. As a submitter, you can type just one line into ChatGPT, for example: Write me a KubeCon + CloudNativeCon talk abstract on Validating Admission Policy And it produces something that, on the surface, looks pretty good!* Title: Enforcing What Matters: Building Safer Kubernetes with Validating Admission Policies Abstract: As Kubernetes adoption continues to grow across organizations, ensuring workloads meet security, compliance, and operational standards before hitting the cluster is more critical than ever.</description></item><item><title>Celebrating 100 Golden Kubestronauts</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-08-21-celebrating-100-golden-kubestronauts/</link><pubDate>Thu, 21 Aug 2025 13:59:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-08-21-celebrating-100-golden-kubestronauts/</guid><description>What is a Golden Kubestronaut?

This matters because while GenAI can generate content, ideas, or responses, it can’t act on them. However, when combined with Agentic AI, your systems shift from being reactive and prompt-driven to autonomous and outcome-oriented. This article aims to help senior technology leaders better understand the value Agentic AI can add to existing AI infrastructure, while outlining key considerations to determine whether its implementation aligns with your business needs. Image caption: Core components of an Agentic AI Architecture from Markovate. Agentic AI systems are designed to operate autonomously, perceiving their environment, making decisions, and executing actions without continuous human oversight. This autonomy enables businesses to streamline operations, reduce costs, and enhance scalability. The image above illustrates how the following systems function: Perception layer: This layer involves collecting data from various sources i. e. sensors, cameras, microphones, and digital inputs, to understand the current state of the environment. For businesses, this means real-time monitoring of operations, customer interactions, and market trends, facilitating proactive decision-making and rapid response to changing conditions. Cognition layer: Once data is collected, the cognition layer processes this information to interpret context, recognise patterns, and determine the best course of action.</description></item><item><title>Gear Up for the 5th Annual KCD Washington DC!</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-08-16-gear-up-for-the-5th-annual-kcd-washington-dc/</link><pubDate>Sat, 16 Aug 2025 13:04:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-08-16-gear-up-for-the-5th-annual-kcd-washington-dc/</guid><description>Posted on August 16, 2025 by Matthew Cascio, CNCF Ambassador and KCD Washington DC Organizer We’re so thrilled to be organizing another year of cloud native community in the Nation’s Capital. Past years have witnessed amazing presentations ranging from core Kubernetes topics to emerging trends in ML/AI, sustainability, virtual clusters and more. This year promises to be even more amazing. Our program is set, and includes two new innovations for our KCD: For the first time, we’re offering a hands-on workshop covering basic and intermediate topics on using Prometheus in your observability practice. The curriculum covers 20-25% of the Linux Foundation’s Prometheus Certified Associate (PCA) course. While this workshop does not lead to certification, and is not a substitute for the PCA course, it will give you a solid working knowledge for getting started and perhaps help you decide if you’d like to pursue certification separately – if you do, you’ll be ahead of the game with this solid foundation. We’re adding a government-focused cybersecurity keynote by our special guest, Ashley Jones, Cybersecurity Advisor for Region III of the Department of Homeland Security, Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA. ) Special Government &amp;amp; Cybersecurity Focus – and free admission for our government employee community members! You won’t want to miss Ashley Jones’ keynote if you’re a cybersecurity professional or involved in government technology in any way. A limited number of free tickets will be available soon for our community members working for federal, state or local government agencies. You can request a free government ticket here: https://forms. gle/aLNfRwpvFn3vQ5Vo8 Plus our regular program is amazing! All of that rests on top of our regular program that includes presentations like: Industry perspective: Scaling Cloud Native: Reaching the Next 10 Million Users by Lin Sun at Solo. io K8s in the Enterprise: From Silos to SIGs: Building Kubernetes Community in the Enterprise by Jason Stryker Inclusivity: Unleash Your Inner Ally: Let’s Make Open Source Radically Welcoming! by Catherine Paganini and Christopher Khanoyan advocate for inclusivity in open source.</description></item></channel></rss>
