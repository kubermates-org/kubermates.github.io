API versioning and stability How to use structured z-pages Prerequisites Example: Getting structured responses Important considerations Alpha feature status Security and access control Future evolution Try it out Learn more Get involved Debugging Kubernetes control plane components can be challenging, especially when you need to quickly understand the runtime state of a component or verify its configuration. With Kubernetes 1.35, we&amp;rsquo;re enhancing the z-pages debugging endpoints with structured, machine-parseable responses that make it easier to build tooling and automate troubleshooting workflows. z-pages are special debugging endpoints exposed by Kubernetes control plane components. Introduced as an alpha feature in Kubernetes 1.32, these endpoints provide runtime diagnostics for components like kube-apiserver , kube-controller-manager , kube-scheduler , kubelet and kube-proxy. The name &amp;ldquo;z-pages&amp;rdquo; comes from the convention of using /*z paths for debugging endpoints. kube-apiserver kube-controller-manager kube-scheduler kubelet kube-proxy /*z Currently, Kubernetes supports two primary z-page endpoints: /statusz /flagz These endpoints are valuable for human operators who need to quickly inspect component state, but until now, they only returned plain text output that was difficult to parse programmatically. Kubernetes 1.35 introduces structured, versioned responses for both /statusz and /flagz endpoints. This enhancement maintains backward compatibility with the existing plain text format while adding support for machine-readable JSON responses. /statusz /flagz The new structured responses are opt-in.</description></item><item><title>Kubernetes v1.35: Watch Based Route Reconciliation in the Cloud Controller Manager</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-12-30-kubernetes-v1-35-watch-based-route-reconciliation-in-the-cloud-controller-manage/</link><pubDate>Tue, 30 Dec 2025 10:30:00 -0800</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-12-30-kubernetes-v1-35-watch-based-route-reconciliation-in-the-cloud-controller-manage/</guid><description>Kubernetes v1.35: Watch Based Route Reconciliation in the Cloud Controller Manager What&amp;rsquo;s new? About the feature gate How can I learn more? Up to and including Kubernetes v1.34, the route controller in Cloud Controller Manager (CCM) implementations built using the k8s. io/cloud-provider library reconciles routes at a fixed interval. This causes unnecessary API requests to the cloud provider when there are no changes to routes. Other controllers implemented through the same library already use watch-based mechanisms, leveraging informers to avoid unnecessary API calls. A new feature gate is being introduced in v1.35 to allow changing the behavior of the route controller to use watch-based informers. The feature gate CloudControllerManagerWatchBasedRoutesReconciliation has been introduced to k8s. io/cloud-provider in alpha stage by SIG Cloud Provider. To enable this feature you can use &amp;ndash;feature-gate=CloudControllerManagerWatchBasedRoutesReconciliation=true in the CCM implementation you are using. CloudControllerManagerWatchBasedRoutesReconciliation &amp;ndash;feature-gate=CloudControllerManagerWatchBasedRoutesReconciliation=true This feature gate will trigger the route reconciliation loop whenever a node is added, deleted, or the fields. spec. podCIDRs or. status.</description></item><item><title>Kubernetes v1.35: Introducing Workload Aware Scheduling</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-12-29-kubernetes-v1-35-introducing-workload-aware-scheduling/</link><pubDate>Mon, 29 Dec 2025 10:30:00 -0800</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-12-29-kubernetes-v1-35-introducing-workload-aware-scheduling/</guid><description>Kubernetes v1.35: Introducing Workload Aware Scheduling Workload aware scheduling Workload API How gang scheduling works Opportunistic batching Restrictions The north star vision Getting started Learn more Scheduling large workloads is a much more complex and fragile operation than scheduling a single Pod, as it often requires considering all Pods together instead of scheduling each one independently. For example, when scheduling a machine learning batch job, you often need to place each worker strategically, such as on the same rack, to make the entire process as efficient as possible. At the same time, the Pods that are part of such a workload are very often identical from the scheduling perspective, which fundamentally changes how this process should look. There are many custom schedulers adapted to perform workload scheduling efficiently, but considering how common and important workload scheduling is to Kubernetes users, especially in the AI era with the growing number of use cases, it is high time to make workloads a first-class citizen for kube-scheduler and support them natively. kube-scheduler The recent 1.35 release of Kubernetes delivered the first tranche of workload aware scheduling improvements. These are part of a wider effort that is aiming to improve scheduling and management of workloads. The effort will span over many SIGs and releases, and is supposed to gradually expand capabilities of the system toward reaching the north star goal, which is seamless workload scheduling and management in Kubernetes including, but not limited to, preemption and autoscaling. Kubernetes v1.35 introduces the Workload API that you can use to describe the desired shape as well as scheduling-oriented requirements of the workload. It comes with an initial implementation of gang scheduling that instructs the kube-scheduler to schedule gang Pods in the all-or-nothing fashion. Finally, we improved scheduling of identical Pods (that typically make a gang) to speed up the process thanks to the opportunistic batching feature. kube-scheduler The new Workload API resource is part of the scheduling. k8s.</description></item><item><title>NVMe Memory Tiering Design and Sizing on VMware Cloud Foundation 9 Part 5: Deployment Scenarios (Greenfield, Brownfield, Nested Lab)</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-12-29-nvme-memory-tiering-design-and-sizing-on-vmware-cloud-foundation-9-part-5-deploy/</link><pubDate>Mon, 29 Dec 2025 12:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-12-29-nvme-memory-tiering-design-and-sizing-on-vmware-cloud-foundation-9-part-5-deploy/</guid><description>Greenfield Deployments Brownfield Deployments Lab Deployments Discover more from VMware Cloud Foundation (VCF) Blog Related Articles NVMe Memory Tiering Design and Sizing on VMware Cloud Foundation 9 Part 5: Deployment Scenarios (Greenfield, Brownfield, Nested Lab) NVMe Memory Tiering Design and Sizing on VMware Cloud Foundation 9 Part 4: vSAN Compatibility and Storage Considerations NVMe Memory Tiering Design and Sizing on VMware Cloud Foundation 9 Part 3: Sizing for Success In this part of the blog series, I want to provide some information about the differences when enabling Memory Tiering in different scenarios. Although the core process remains the same, there are things that may require extra attention and planning to save some time and effort. When we talk about greenfield scenarios, we refer to brand new VMware Cloud Foundation (VCF) deployments including new hardware and new configuration for the whole stack. Brownfield scenarios will cover configuring Memory Tiering on an existing VCF environment. Lastly, I do want to include lab scenarios as I have seen mixed statements that this is not supported, but I will cover this at the end of this blog post. Let’s start with the configuration process of greenfield environments. In Part 4 , I covered how VMware vSAN and Memory Tiering are compatible and can co-exist in the same cluster. I’ve also highlighted something important that you should be aware of during greenfield deployments of VCF. As of VCF 9.0, enabling Memory Tiering is a “Day 2” operation, meaning that you first configure VCF and then you can configure Memory Tiering, but during the VCF deployment workflow, you will notice there is no option to enable Memory Tiering (yet), but you can enable vSAN. How you handle your NVMe device dedicated for Memory Tiering will dictate the steps necessary to get that device presented for its configuration. If all the NVMe devices for both vSAN and Memory Tiering are present during the VCF deployment, chances are vSAN may auto-claim all of the drives (including the NVMe device you have allocated for Memory Tiering). In this case you would have to remove the drive from vSAN post-configuration, erase partitions and then start your Memory Tiering configuration.</description></item><item><title>Kubernetes v1.35: Fine-grained Supplemental Groups Control Graduates to GA</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-12-23-kubernetes-v1-35-fine-grained-supplemental-groups-control-graduates-to-ga/</link><pubDate>Tue, 23 Dec 2025 10:30:00 -0800</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-12-23-kubernetes-v1-35-fine-grained-supplemental-groups-control-graduates-to-ga/</guid><description>Kubernetes v1.35: Fine-grained Supplemental Groups Control Graduates to GA Motivation: Implicit group memberships defined in /etc/group in the container image What&amp;rsquo;s wrong with it? Fine-grained supplemental groups control in a Pod: supplementaryGroupsPolicy Attached process identity in Pod status Strict policy requires up-to-date container runtimes Getting involved How can I learn more? On behalf of Kubernetes SIG Node, we are pleased to announce the graduation of fine-grained supplemental groups control to General Availability (GA) in Kubernetes v1.35! The new Pod field, supplementalGroupsPolicy , was introduced as an opt-in alpha feature for Kubernetes v1.31, and then had graduated to beta in v1.33. Now, the feature is generally available. This feature allows you to implement more precise control over supplemental groups in Linux containers that can strengthen the security posture particularly in accessing volumes. Moreover, it also enhances the transparency of UID/GID details in containers, offering improved security oversight. supplementalGroupsPolicy If you are planning to upgrade your cluster from v1.32 or an earlier version, please be aware that some behavioral breaking change introduced since beta (v1.33). For more details, see the behavioral changes introduced in beta and the upgrade considerations sections of the previous blog for graduation to beta. /etc/group Even though the majority of Kubernetes cluster admins/users may not be aware of this, by default Kubernetes merges group information from the Pod with information defined in /etc/group in the container image. /etc/group Here&amp;rsquo;s an example; a Pod manifest that specifies spec. securityContext. runAsUser: 1000 , spec. securityContext. runAsGroup: 3000 and spec.</description></item><item><title>Kubernetes v1.35: Kubelet Configuration Drop-in Directory Graduates to GA</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-12-22-kubernetes-v1-35-kubelet-configuration-drop-in-directory-graduates-to-ga/</link><pubDate>Mon, 22 Dec 2025 10:30:00 -0800</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-12-22-kubernetes-v1-35-kubelet-configuration-drop-in-directory-graduates-to-ga/</guid><description>Kubernetes v1.35: Kubelet Configuration Drop-in Directory Graduates to GA The problem: managing kubelet configuration at scale Example use cases Managing heterogeneous node pools Gradual configuration rollouts Viewing the merged configuration Good practices Acknowledgments Get involved With the recent v1.35 release of Kubernetes, support for a kubelet configuration drop-in directory is generally available. The newly stable feature simplifies the management of kubelet configuration across large, heterogeneous clusters. With v1.35, the kubelet command line argument &amp;ndash;config-dir is production-ready and fully supported, allowing you to specify a directory containing kubelet configuration drop-in files. All files in that directory will be automatically merged with your main kubelet configuration. This allows cluster administrators to maintain a cohesive base configuration for kubelets while enabling targeted customizations for different node groups or use cases, and without complex tooling or manual configuration management. &amp;ndash;config-dir As Kubernetes clusters grow larger and more complex, they often include heterogeneous node pools with different hardware capabilities, workload requirements, and operational constraints. This diversity necessitates different kubelet configurations across node groups—yet managing these varied configurations at scale becomes increasingly challenging. Several pain points emerge: Configuration drift : Different nodes may have slightly different configurations, leading to inconsistent behavior Node group customization : GPU nodes, edge nodes, and standard compute nodes often require different kubelet settings Operational overhead : Maintaining separate, complete configuration files for each node type is error-prone and difficult to audit Change management : Rolling out configuration changes across heterogeneous node pools requires careful coordination Before this support was added to Kubernetes, cluster administrators had to choose between using a single monolithic configuration file for all nodes, manually maintaining multiple complete configuration files, or relying on separate tooling. Each approach had its own drawbacks. This graduation to stable gives cluster administrators a fully supported fourth way to solve that challenge. Consider a cluster with multiple node types: standard compute nodes, high-capacity nodes (such as those with GPUs or large amounts of memory), and edge nodes with specialized requirements.

The key takeaway ? Always upgrade to etcd v3.5.26 or later before moving to v3.6. This ensures your cluster is automatically repaired, and avoids zombie members. Recently, the etcd community addressed an issue that may appear when users upgrade from v3.5 to v3.6. This bug can cause the cluster to report &amp;ldquo;zombie members&amp;rdquo;, which are etcd nodes that were removed from the database cluster some time ago, and are re-appearing and joining database consensus. The etcd cluster is then inoperable until these zombie members are removed. In etcd v3.5 and earlier, the v2store was the source of truth for membership data, even though the v3store was also present. As a part of our v2store deprecation plan , in v3.6 the v3store is the source of truth for cluster membership. Through a bug report we found out that, in some older clusters, v2store and v3store could become inconsistent. This inconsistency manifests after upgrading as seeing old, removed &amp;ldquo;zombie&amp;rdquo; cluster members re-appearing in the cluster. We’ve added a mechanism in etcd v3.5.26 to automatically sync v3store from v2store, ensuring that affected clusters are repaired before upgrading to 3.6. x.</description></item><item><title>5 Key Principles of Modern Applications</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-12-19-5-key-principles-of-modern-applications/</link><pubDate>Fri, 19 Dec 2025 20:24:25 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-12-19-5-key-principles-of-modern-applications/</guid><description>Framework for Building, Running, and Managing Apps for the Next Decade 1.

How can I start using in-place Pod Resize? How does this help me? Changes between beta (1.33) and stable (1.35) What&amp;rsquo;s next? Integration with autoscalers and other projects Feature expansion Improved stability Providing feedback This release marks a major step: more than 6 years after its initial conception, the In-Place Pod Resize feature (also known as In-Place Pod Vertical Scaling), first introduced as alpha in Kubernetes v1.27, and graduated to beta in Kubernetes v1.33, is now stable (GA) in Kubernetes 1.35! This graduation is a major milestone for improving resource efficiency and flexibility for workloads running on Kubernetes. In the past, the CPU and memory resources allocated to a container in a Pod were immutable. This meant changing them required deleting and recreating the entire Pod. For stateful services, batch jobs, or latency-sensitive workloads, this was an incredibly disruptive operation. In-Place Pod Resize makes CPU and memory requests and limits mutable, allowing you to adjust these resources within a running Pod, often without requiring a container restart.

Furthering this is cloud computing, which serves as the foundation of the AI economy, meaning that enterprises and nations require greater control, transparency, and assurance over data location and protection. Trust has become not just a technical question, but a matter of national policy, corporate strategy, and even societal resilience. At the same time, the explosion of AI and machine learning (ML) workloads is reshaping infrastructure requirements. But these shifts pose a complex question—if your most valuable models and datasets are in the cloud, how do you assess their security posture? Here lies the central dilemma. The very abstraction that makes the cloud powerful also makes it opaque. You don’t control the hardware, the hypervisor, or the low-level firmware that your workloads depend on. How do you trust something you cannot see or control? The old paradigm of “trust but verify” no longer works in this modern environment. Instead, the principle of zero trust, “assume nothing, verify everything,” has become a core tenet of modern security strategy. This is where the next generation of security concepts comes into play. Confidential computing, through hardware-based trusted execution environments (TEEs), enables organizations to protect their data not only at rest and in transit, but also in use.</description></item><item><title>Friday Five — December 19, 2025</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-12-19-friday-five-december-19-2025/</link><pubDate>Fri, 19 Dec 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-12-19-friday-five-december-19-2025/</guid><description>Friday Five — December 19, 2025 Red Hat Accelerates AI Trust and Security with Chatterbox Labs Acquisition Fierce Network - Red Hat&amp;rsquo;s CTO keeps an &amp;lsquo;open&amp;rsquo; mind on AI Looking ahead to 2026: Red Hat’s view across the hybrid cloud AI Magazine - How Red Hat and AWS Bring Scalable Gen AI to the Enterprise SiliconANGLE - Powering the AI machine: Red Hat leverages the cloud-native open source toolbox to build solutions for next-gen IT About the author Red Hat Corporate Communications More like this Master modern hybrid cloud security and scale with Red Hat updates F5 BIG-IP Virtual Edition is now validated for Red Hat OpenShift Virtualization Technically Speaking | Platform engineering for AI agents Technically Speaking | Driving healthcare discoveries with AI Keep exploring Browse by channel Automation Artificial intelligence Open hybrid cloud Security Edge computing Infrastructure Applications Virtualization Share Red Hat has acquired Chatterbox Labs, a specialist in AI safety and generative AI guardrails.

Their strategy relies on a single, non-negotiable mandate: everything must be keyless. Image 1: From left, Satish Puranam, Director of Cloud and Developer Experience at Ford, and Sitaram Iyer, VP of Emerging Technologies at CyberArk. To achieve this scale, Ford has abandoned static secrets entirely, implementing 100% identity-driven automation and Policy as Code (PoC) enforcement directly on the Kubernetes platform. Ford’s Red Hat OpenShift footprint spans diverse workloads, from consumer-facing applications to highly regulated manufacturing and warranty systems. This highly dynamic environment requires clusters to be regularly spun up and torn down, often pushing core Kubernetes limits (such as etcd capacity) and necessitating constant defragmentation or provisioning of new clusters. To manage this scale, Ford imposes strict guardrails and standardizes on Red Hat OpenShift across its multicloud and multi-datacenter infrastructure. As Satish noted, &amp;ldquo;Our decades-long journey is all about hiding complexity and barriers for the developer. You learn it once, use it over and over again, and it scales very well. It allows us to actually update and upgrade our systems at a rapid clip. &amp;quot; Image 2: Ford’s journey with Red Hat OpenShift By standardizing the platform, Ford can upgrade systems rapidly without burdening teams with infrastructure friction. Ford’s scaling strategy eliminates long-lived, static credentials, or &amp;ldquo;secrets,&amp;rdquo; in favor of 100% automated machine identity.</description></item><item><title>Turning automation spend into a measurable advantage</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-12-19-turning-automation-spend-into-a-measurable-advantage/</link><pubDate>Fri, 19 Dec 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-12-19-turning-automation-spend-into-a-measurable-advantage/</guid><description>Turning automation spend into a measurable advantage Financial clarity: Measuring automation’s ROI Strategic governance and risk mitigation Bridging the gap to Business Intelligence (BI) The need for data-driven automation Want to learn more?

Organizations have moved beyond simple scripting to focus on speed and impact, using automation to power growth and reduce risk. But a critical gap remains: visibility. How do you, as a business leader, prove the return on investment (ROI) and confidently decide where to invest your next dollar? Red Hat Ansible Automation Platform&amp;rsquo;s automation dashboard and analytics feature is more than an IT report; it&amp;rsquo;s the financial and operational intelligence layer executives need to realize the full value of enterprise automation. Automation is a cost center until its value is quantifiable. The automation dashboard bridges that gap, converting technical wins—like time saved and job completion rates—into clear financial data. Demonstrate financial impact: No longer guess at ROI. The platform translates key metrics into reportable savings and ROI. This data enables clear reporting to leadership and key stakeholders, elevating automation from isolated IT tools into a mission-critical business asset. Prioritize with the savings planner: Looking ahead is equally as important as current reporting. The savings planner forecasts cost and time savings for potential tasks over the next 1 to 3 years. By prioritizing efforts that deliver maximum financial return, your automation roadmap can align with your business objectives.</description></item><item><title>Why should your organization standardize on Red Hat Enterprise Linux today?</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-12-19-why-should-your-organization-standardize-on-red-hat-enterprise-linux-today/</link><pubDate>Fri, 19 Dec 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-12-19-why-should-your-organization-standardize-on-red-hat-enterprise-linux-today/</guid><description>Why should your organization standardize on Red Hat Enterprise Linux today?

The content is fresh in my mind, and I wanted to share some of it with you in advance, as I believe it contains compelling insights. As you likely know, we launched numerous new features and capabilities this year with RHEL 10 , including image mode for RHEL , which enables users to create and manage operating system images for consistent deployment, and the RHEL command-line assistant powered by Lightspeed, which uses generative AI to help users execute complex command-line tasks. We also announced the inclusion of post-quantum encryption algorithms to help your organization resist future security attacks. More recently, with the launch of RHEL 10.1 and 9.7 , we included support for AI accelerators via our repositories, and also introduced a RHEL offline command-line assistant in dev preview , along with RHEL HPC for Azure. Furthermore, just a few weeks ago, we announced the Red Hat Project Hummingbird. These innovative features, capabilities, and key announcements—spanning consistency, AI integration, advanced security, and high-performance computing—reinforce RHEL&amp;rsquo;s position as the leading enterprise Linux platform. They are a compelling reason to standardize your infrastructure on RHEL, ensuring you are equipped with a consistent, secure, and modern operating system foundation ready for the future of IT. We have many more exciting developments planned for 2026, so stay tuned and make sure you check out the links above in case you missed any of these significant announcements. In this blog, I want to discuss how standardizing on RHEL across your entire infrastructure will help solve many critical organizational challenges and the specific business outcomes it will deliver. Standardizing on RHEL refers to adopting a uniform approach to using RHEL across your organization. It involves selecting RHEL and implementing it consistently across all systems.</description></item><item><title>Kubernetes v1.35: Job Managed By Goes GA</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-12-18-kubernetes-v1-35-job-managed-by-goes-ga/</link><pubDate>Thu, 18 Dec 2025 10:30:00 -0800</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-12-18-kubernetes-v1-35-job-managed-by-goes-ga/</guid><description>Kubernetes v1.35: Job Managed By Goes GA Why delegate Job reconciliation?

The primary motivation for this feature is to support multi-cluster batch scheduling architectures, such as MultiKueue. The MultiKueue architecture distinguishes between a Management Cluster and a pool of Worker Clusters: The Management Cluster is responsible for dispatching Jobs but not executing them. It needs to accept Job objects to track status, but it skips the creation and execution of Pods. The Worker Clusters receive the dispatched Jobs and execute the actual Pods.

This gets the job done, but nobody enjoys maintaining 2 sets of infrastructure with 2 different lifecycles. It’s a tax we all pay because there hasn’t been a clean alternative. Now there is. F5 BIG-IP Virtual Edition (VE) is officially validated by F5 to support Red Hat OpenShift Virtualization and listed in the Red Hat Ecosystem Catalog. With this milestone achievement, F5 provides further validation of customer demand for a hybrid container and virtualization platform. OpenShift Virtualization lets you run virtual machines (VMs) directly on your worker nodes. With the validation in place, BIG-IP VE can now be deployed among them, rather than requiring a separate environment you keep around solely for network appliances. Administrators can enjoy 1 control plane, 1 lifecycle, 1 place to look when something needs patching. This isn’t a cut-down version or a feature-limited build. VE inside OpenShift is the very same BIG-IP. Your existing configs—WAF policies, iRules, routing decisions, all the customizations required for your applications—can be used as is.</description></item><item><title>Resilient model training on Red Hat OpenShift AI with Kubeflow Trainer</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-12-18-resilient-model-training-on-red-hat-openshift-ai-with-kubeflow-trainer/</link><pubDate>Thu, 18 Dec 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-12-18-resilient-model-training-on-red-hat-openshift-ai-with-kubeflow-trainer/</guid><description>Resilient model training on Red Hat OpenShift AI with Kubeflow Trainer Problem: Training failures are expensive Real-world cost impact Challenges in shared cluster environments Periodic checkpointing and its limitations How periodic checkpointing works Critical limitations of periodic checkpointing The need for a better solution The solution: Just-in-time (JIT) checkpointing How JIT checkpointing works How JIT checkpointing overcomes periodic checkpointing limitations Windows of vulnerability Training interruption Unpredictable preemption Storage overhead Cost savings Use cases and common scenarios Kueue preemption protection Planned maintenance windows Resource rebalancing GPU-as-a-service Combining JIT with periodic checkpointing Red Hat OpenShift AI integration with Kubeflow Trainer v2 Coming soon: Full JIT checkpointing support Red Hat OpenShift AI (Self-Managed) | Product Trial About the author Esa Fazal More like this Looking ahead to 2026: Red Hat’s view across the hybrid cloud Red Hat to acquire Chatterbox Labs: Frequently Asked Questions Technically Speaking | Platform engineering for AI agents Technically Speaking | Driving healthcare discoveries with AI Keep exploring Browse by channel Automation Artificial intelligence Open hybrid cloud Security Edge computing Infrastructure Applications Virtualization Share Imagine that after 60 hours of training, a large language model (LLM) on an 8x NVIDIA H100 GPU cluster costing $55 an hour, your job fails at 90% completion. You must restart from your last checkpoint, which was saved 3 hours ago, wasting $165 in compute costs, and delaying model deployment. This kind of scenario isn&amp;rsquo;t hypothetical, it&amp;rsquo;s a daily reality for organizations running distributed AI training workloads in production environments. LLM training represents one of the most compute-intensive workloads in modern AI infrastructure. With GPU clusters costing thousands of dollars and training jobs running for days or weeks, any interruption can result in catastrophic financial losses and project delays. This article explores the challenges of distributed model training, examines the limitations of existing periodic checkpointing approaches, and introduces just-in-time (JIT) checkpointing, a new capability coming to Red Hat OpenShift AI 3.2 that protects your training investments while enabling new operational patterns like GPU-as-a-service and sustainable AI training practices. The financial and operational impact of training failures extends far beyond individual job restarts. Industry-facing studies show that a substantial fraction of GPU compute is wasted. For example, one study found many training jobs operating at less than 50% GPU utilization. Others show that interruptions and slowdowns due to failures or stragglers can delay job completion by roughly 2 times or more than planned. Taken together, findings across large-scale machine learning (ML) clusters suggest that 30% or more of GPU spending may be lost to idle time, interruptions, and inefficiencies. Consider a financial services organization training a fraud detection model on an 8 GPU cluster: Training duration : 72 hours planned GPU cost : $55/hour for 8 GPU cluster (AWS p5.</description></item><item><title>RPM and DNF features and enhancements in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 10.1</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-12-18-rpm-and-dnf-features-and-enhancements-in-red-hat-enterprise-linux-10-1/</link><pubDate>Thu, 18 Dec 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-12-18-rpm-and-dnf-features-and-enhancements-in-red-hat-enterprise-linux-10-1/</guid><description>RPM and DNF features and enhancements in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 10.1 RPM signature improvements Modularity and DNF Better software management Red Hat Enterprise Linux | Product trial About the author Samantha Bueno More like this More than meets the eye: Behind the scenes of Red Hat Enterprise Linux 10 (Part 4) Looking ahead to 2026: Red Hat’s view across the hybrid cloud At Your Serverless | Command Line Heroes The Overlooked Operating System | Compiler: Stack/Unstuck Keep exploring Browse by channel Automation Artificial intelligence Open hybrid cloud Security Edge computing Infrastructure Applications Virtualization Share Red Hat Enterprise Linux 10.1 (RHEL) features some significant updates to RPM and DNF, two technologies designed to help you manage software installs and updates. The RPM package manager (RPM) creates installation files used to install and uninstall an application, and that can be queried for information about what libraries and binaries the application contains. The dnf command is the tool used on RHEL to search for available applications, and then to install, update, or uninstall them. These are important components of a computer system, so we&amp;rsquo;ve worked hard to improve them. dnf As we prepare for the next generation of security threats and adapt to the new and evolving post-quantum computing world, we&amp;rsquo;ve made a number of enhancements to RPM&amp;rsquo;s signature capabilities. RPM signatures are a security feature used with RPM packages to verify the package&amp;rsquo;s authenticity and integrity, ensuring it came from a trusted source and hasn&amp;rsquo;t been tampered with since it was signed. These changes include improvements to support differing formats and algorithms, and adding options that give customers greater control over managing signatures. It offers select signature algorithms of your choice like ML-DSA, which can be used for post-quantum signing. The introduction of RPMv6 signatures enables multiple signatures per package and adds support for the new, stronger OpenPGP v6 standard. OpenPGP v6 is the latest version of the OpenPGP cryptographic standard, finalized as RFC 9580, which updates the standard with modern cryptographic practices. Customers will also have the freedom to select signature algorithms of their choice. These new features ultimately enable us to ship packages with a set of signatures utilizing different algorithms currently thought to be post-quantum safe.</description></item><item><title>VCF Breakroom Chats Episode 76: Cloud Admin Fast Track – Learn Infrastructure as Code the Easy Way with VCF 9.0</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-12-17-vcf-breakroom-chats-episode-76-cloud-admin-fast-track-learn-infrastructure-as-co/</link><pubDate>Wed, 17 Dec 2025 22:13:13 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-12-17-vcf-breakroom-chats-episode-76-cloud-admin-fast-track-learn-infrastructure-as-co/</guid><description>About the VCF Breakroom Chat Series Discover more from VMware Cloud Foundation (VCF) Blog Related Articles VCF Breakroom Chats Episode 76: Cloud Admin Fast Track – Learn Infrastructure as Code the Easy Way with VCF 9.0 VCF Breakroom Chats Episode 75 - Breaking the GitOps Barrier: Continuous Delivery for Modern Apps with VCF 9 VMware Cloud Foundation Automation – Consume and Deploy Virtual Machines and Kubernetes Clusters Ready to make Infrastructure as Code feel easy?

Developers and enterprises struggle to ingest diverse data sources, structure content for semantic search, and maintain accurate, verifiable answers. Enhancements to DigitalOcean Gradient™ AI Knowledge Bases , now in public preview , are designed to solve this problem. Its code-first feature lets developers create, manage, and query knowledge bases entirely from code, giving full control over ingestion, chunking, embedding, and retrieval without having to worry about the underlying infrastructure. Many existing solutions let developers create a basic knowledge base, but they often struggle to scale, customize, or integrate it into production workflows. The improvements address this by providing a code-first, developer-focused toolkit that handles the full knowledge base lifecycle. Developers can ingest data from files, Dropbox, web crawlers, control chunking and embedding strategies, and run natural language queries that return citation-backed answers with metadata filters. With well-documented APIs and SDKs, these integrations are seamless, letting developers manage everything entirely in code. The public preview highlights the essential tools developers need to build and manage knowledge bases effectively: Direct API Access: Query knowledge bases directly without needing an agent, giving full control for integration into apps or RAG pipelines. Customizable ingestion: Ingest content from supported sources such as files, web crawlers, and Dropbox datasets. Supports structured data, sitemap crawling, and accurate parsing of complex PDFs. Flexible chunking and embedding: Choose the chunking strategy that fits your content and select from high-performance embedding models (including a multi-lingual embedding model).</description></item><item><title>Kubernetes v1.35: Timbernetes (The World Tree Release)</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-12-17-kubernetes-v1-35-timbernetes-the-world-tree-release/</link><pubDate>Wed, 17 Dec 2025 10:30:00 -0800</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-12-17-kubernetes-v1-35-timbernetes-the-world-tree-release/</guid><description>Kubernetes v1.35: Timbernetes (The World Tree Release) Release theme and logo Spotlight on key updates Stable: In-place update of Pod resources Beta: Pod certificates for workload identity and security Alpha: Node declared features before scheduling Features graduating to Stable PreferSameNode traffic distribution Job API managed-by mechanism Reliable Pod update tracking with. metadata. generation Configurable NUMA node limit for topology manager New features in Beta Expose node topology labels via Downward API Native support for storage version migration Mutable Volume attach limits Opportunistic batching maxUnavailable for StatefulSets Configurable credential plugin policy in kuberc KYAML Configurable tolerance for HorizontalPodAutoscalers Support for user namespaces in Pods VolumeSource: OCI artifact and/or image Enforced kubelet credential verification for cached images Fine-grained Container restart rules CSI driver opt-in for service account tokens via secrets field Deployment status: count of terminating replicas New features in Alpha Gang scheduling support in Kubernetes Constrained impersonation Flagz for Kubernetes components Statusz for Kubernetes components CCM: watch-based route controller reconciliation using informers Extended toleration operators for threshold-based placement Mutable container resources when Job is suspended Other notable changes Continued innovation in Dynamic Resource Allocation (DRA) Comparable resource version semantics Graduations, deprecations, and removals in v1.35 Graduations to stable Deprecations, removals and community updates Release notes Availability Release team Project velocity Events update Upcoming release webinar Get involved Editors : Aakanksha Bhende, Arujjwal Negi, Chad M.

Orchestrating LLM interactions, managing state, wiring up function calling, integrating multiple tools, evaluating performance, tracing failures, and deploying to production often require complex custom code and scattered tooling. The DigitalOcean Gradient™ AI Agent Development Kit (ADK) , now available in public preview , is designed to solve exactly that problem. It’s a powerful, code-first SDK that lets you build, test, and deploy sophisticated multi-step agent workflows from within their existing development environments, with built-in support for evaluations, traceability, and knowledge bases. To see the ADK in action and for help getting started, check out our tutorial. Most AI frameworks solve the “day-one” problem: how to create a working agent. But they fall short on the “day-two” problem: how to operate that agent in production. We built the ADK to give you a standardized, production-grade framework that handles the full lifecycle: Orchestration: Build multi-step workflows without boilerplate State management: Keep track of what your agent is doing across steps Tool integration: Register custom functions/APIs as first-class tools Knowledge base support: Connect agents to your existing DO Knowledge Bases Evaluations: Measure correctness, security, tone, and retrieval quality Tracing: Understand how your agent behaves at every span and step Deployment: Ship your entire agent system, from logic to KBs to tools, with one command The result is a code-first experience that lets you move from local development → observability → evaluation → deployment in a single, consistent workflow. Our goal is to provide a strong foundation for developers to build, test, and deploy AI agent workflows directly from their development environment. In the private preview, you could leverage the core SDK framework with CRUD APIs, connect models, organize projects in workspaces, use the entry point decorator and CLI, and take advantage of MCP support on the Agent Platform. Building on this foundation, the public preview introduces a set of powerful new features to help you run production-level workflows more efficiently and with deeper visibility: Traces &amp;amp; Insights for Any Workflow : Add full tracing to your agent logic using custom decorators, even without LangGraph. Spans, steps, and KB interactions appear in the Gradient AI Platform UI, helping you understand your agent’s behavior at every step.</description></item><item><title>A Year of Innovation: DigitalOcean Managed Databases in 2025</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-12-17-a-year-of-innovation-digitalocean-managed-databases-in-2025/</link><pubDate>Wed, 17 Dec 2025 16:37:44 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-12-17-a-year-of-innovation-digitalocean-managed-databases-in-2025/</guid><description>A Year of Innovation: DigitalOcean Managed Databases in 2025 MCP Server (August) Advanced configuration for Managed Databases UI (August) Storage autoscaling (October) PostgreSQL 18 (November) Support for Remote MCP Server (December) Improved migration tooling in the cloud console (December) What’s to come in 2026 About the author Try DigitalOcean for free By Nicole Ghalwash Published: December 17, 2025 4 min read 2025 was a big year for DigitalOcean Managed Databases, packed with meaningful enhancements designed to deliver more power, flexibility, and simplicity for developers and businesses of all sizes. With performance boosts and new database engines introduced to improve scalability, automation, and observability, this year’s releases focused on making it easier than ever to build and run reliable data-backed applications on DigitalOcean. In this recap, we’ll walk through the most impactful launches in both the first and second half of the year and how they help teams move faster while keeping complexity low. First, let’s take a look at our releases in the first half of the year (H1) : – Managed PostgreSQL support for v17 [February] – Managed MongoDB support for v8 [March] – Support for up to 20TB for Managed MySQL and 30TB for PostgreSQL [March] – Introducing DigitalOcean Managed Caching for Valkey [April] – Introducing Role-Based Access Control to DigitalOcean Managed MongoDB with Predefined Roles [May] – Database Observability, Monitoring, and Hardening Advancements [June] – Support for Kafka Schema Registry [July] The second half (H2) of 2025 saw even more big developments for DigitalOcean Managed Databases: The DigitalOcean MCP (Model Context Protocol) Server lets you manage your cloud resources using simple, natural-language commands through AI-powered tools like Cursor, Claude, or your own custom LLMs. Running locally, it streamlines tasks such as provisioning Managed Databases, making cloud operations faster, easier, and more intuitive for developers. DigitalOcean MCP Server marks a major step forward in bringing AI directly into cloud infrastructure workflows. It allows users to seamlessly integrate cloud management into AI assistants or custom-built agents while eliminating context switching, manual API calls, and constant console navigation. MCP Servers make managing cloud infrastructure with LLMs faster, more secure, and far more accessible. We introduced advanced configuration options in the Managed Databases UI, giving developers more control without needing API calls or manual setup. With this update, you can fine-tune performance settings, customize connection parameters, and tailor your database environment directly from the dashboard. It’s a faster, more intuitive way to optimize your databases for your specific workloads. Launched at our Deploy conference in London, this feature marks another major milestone for automation in database environments.</description></item><item><title>Deploy VCF Private AI Services in Minimal VMware Cloud Foundation Environments</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-12-17-deploy-vcf-private-ai-services-in-minimal-vmware-cloud-foundation-environments/</link><pubDate>Wed, 17 Dec 2025 14:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-12-17-deploy-vcf-private-ai-services-in-minimal-vmware-cloud-foundation-environments/</guid><description>Deployment Workflow Overview Prerequisites Deploy VCF Private AI Services 1.

Sometimes, support drops for a feature or capability on which they rely. Other times, it’s that they can’t wait for a new feature, bug fix, and so on. Planning for Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) with its built-in digital roadmap, powered by Red Hat Lightspeed, is changing that. Product managers within RHEL now communicate directly with you about upcoming changes in the code base. This gives you more time to plan for changes, as well as clearer information about what’s changing. This simplifies upgrades and helps inform the automation your teams are building for the platform. Executing on this vision, we are eager to announce our first planned change to the next major version of RHEL: Removal of support for modularity in RHEL 11! This update excites RHEL product managers, who work tirelessly to keep feature roadmaps perfectly updated for customers, partners, and Red Hat engineers alike, but many readers may find this a curious announcement. Read on to better understand why it&amp;rsquo;s so exciting. Since the launch of RHEL in 2002, there has been an ongoing challenge to enable the multitude of developer applications, languages, and tools, as well as their differing versions function seamlessly together on a stable, enterprise-grade operating system. Initial workarounds include providing one-version-only support at each major OS release, or in 2013 introducing Red Hat Software Collections to allow for newer versioned applications to be installed in isolated directories. Given a developer&amp;rsquo;s need for modern software versions before a major OS upgrade, on top of the tediousness of hard-isolating every newly updated application, a core versioning strategy was needed for RHEL to succeed.</description></item><item><title>Enterprise automation resilience with EDB and Red Hat Ansible Automation Platform</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-12-17-enterprise-automation-resilience-with-edb-and-red-hat-ansible-automation-platfor/</link><pubDate>Wed, 17 Dec 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-12-17-enterprise-automation-resilience-with-edb-and-red-hat-ansible-automation-platfor/</guid><description>Enterprise automation resilience with EDB and Red Hat Ansible Automation Platform Unlocking true resilience How does it work?

From the earliest conceptual stages to the launch at Red Hat Summit 2025, we’ll hear firsthand accounts of how RHEL 10 came into being. Part 1 | Part 2 | Part 3 In our previous installment of the story of how Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) 10 came to be, we got insights into the testing process and how the headline features (and the stories around those features) started coming together. In part 4, those stories come into clearer focus as the team works to put the finishing touches on various features before code freeze. Brian Stinson, principal software engineer &amp;ldquo;The last stretch of time: That part is actually where things get a little bit more intense for the individual teams because it’s not only ‘Are we buttoning up features?’ but ‘Were we able to cover the rest of the baseline enablement stuff we needed to do as part of the release?’ Are all my packages in? Did we get them QE’d on the right schedule? Have they gone out for feedback? Those types of activities actually ramp up quite a bit as we head toward code freeze. &amp;quot; Chris Wells, senior director, Product Marketing - RHEL Business Unit &amp;ldquo;I knew we needed to take this story and try and make it exciting. But we weren&amp;rsquo;t going to change what features were in this release, we could only change how we could talk about those features. So I had a meeting here in Columbus where I pulled in Marty Loveless, who was the lead product marketing manager on RHEL 10, and Scott McCarty, who lives just an hour or two up the road in Akron. He drove down for the day. We locked ourselves in a conference room, and we just brainstormed ‘what were the different angles we could talk about things in?’ Trying to look at something that was new and figure out: Was there a different angle?&amp;rdquo; Major Hayden, senior principal software engineer &amp;ldquo;It was another Red Hatter and I on the engineering side building the code, so he and I divided the work.

This works well for quickly testing out a model and prototyping, but things become complicated when you need to manage dependencies, support different accelerators, or move workloads to Kubernetes. Thankfully, just as containers solved development problems like portability and environment isolation for applications, the same applies to AI models too! RamaLama is an open source project that makes running AI models in containers simple, or in the project’s own words, “boring and predictable. ” Let’s take a look at how it works, and get started with local AI inference , model serving, and retrieval augmented generation (RAG). There are several reasons developers and organizations want local or self-hosted AI: Control for developers: You can run models directly on your own hardware instead of relying on a remote LLM API. This avoids vendor lock-in and gives you full control over how models are executed and integrated. Data privacy for organizations: Enterprises often cannot send sensitive data to external services. Running AI workloads on-premises or in a controlled environment keeps data inside your own infrastructure. Cost management at scale: When you are generating thousands or millions of tokens per day, usage-based cloud APIs can become expensive very quickly. Hosting your own models offers more predictable cost profiles. With RamaLama, you can download, run, and manage your own AI models, just as you would with any other type of workload like a database, backend, etc. RamaLama is a command-line interface (CLI) for running AI models in containers on your machine.</description></item><item><title>Kubernetes v1.32.11</title><link>https://kubermates.org/releases/2025-12-16-kubernetes-v1-32-11/</link><pubDate>Tue, 16 Dec 2025 21:28:50 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/releases/2025-12-16-kubernetes-v1-32-11/</guid><description>See kubernetes-announce@.

Until now, identifying cost anomalies often meant waiting for your monthly invoice or manually calculating month-to-date usage. That changes today. All DigitalOcean customers now have access to the new custom date range billing view. This new feature is accessible in the Billing Console by going to Billing → Insights. Additionally, you can download your report as a CSV so you can view your granular billing insights offline. This update gives you clearer, more granular visibility into your cloud costs (segmented into daily, weekly, and monthly spend by product) making budgeting and forecasting far easier. DevOps, Finance, and growing teams can now manage spend proactively instead of reacting after the fact. For all customers, this feature is available globally and fully self-service via the Cloud Console and API. Here is a close look into the features of this new billing view: Custom date range filtering: You are no longer limited to invoices for viewing your spending. Choose any start and end date to view total spend for that exact range. This makes it easy to align cloud costs with development sprints, project timelines, or product launches–and improves internal chargebacks and budgeting accuracy.</description></item><item><title>NVMe Memory Tiering Design and Sizing on VMware Cloud Foundation 9 Part 4: vSAN Compatibility and Storage Considerations</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-12-16-nvme-memory-tiering-design-and-sizing-on-vmware-cloud-foundation-9-part-4-vsan-c/</link><pubDate>Tue, 16 Dec 2025 12:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-12-16-nvme-memory-tiering-design-and-sizing-on-vmware-cloud-foundation-9-part-4-vsan-c/</guid><description>Storage Considerations Discover more from VMware Cloud Foundation (VCF) Blog Related Articles NVMe Memory Tiering Design and Sizing on VMware Cloud Foundation 9 Part 4: vSAN Compatibility and Storage Considerations Using Harbor as a Proxy Cache for Cloud-Based Registries What to Look for in Network Switches for VMware vSAN We’ve covered a lot of ground in the first 3 parts of this series: PART 1: Prerequisites and Hardware Compatibility PART 2: Design for Security, Redundancy, and Scalability PART 3: Sizing for Success But there is a lot more to learn about Memory Tiering. In fact, vSAN often comes up in conversations about Memory Tiering given its similarities, but also due to compatibility inquiries, so let’s dive in. When we first started working with Memory Tiering, the similarities between Memory Tiering and vSAN OSA were quite evident. Both have a multi-tier approach where active data is on fast devices and dormant data is on less expensive devices, thereby helping reduce TCO and the need for expensive devices for dormant data. They are also both deeply integrated into vSphere and are easy to implement. But aside from similarities, there was initially some confusion about compatibility, integration, and having both features enabled at the same time. So, let me answer those questions. Yes, you can have vSAN and Memory Tiering enabled on the same clusters at the same time. The confusion that exists is more around vSAN providing storage to Memory Tiering which is definitely not supported. I’ve covered this before, but I want to reiterate that although both solutions may be using NVMe devices, it does not mean they can share resources. Memory Tiering requires its own physical or logical device strictly for memory allocation. We do not want to share this physical/logical device with anything else including vSAN or other datastores.</description></item><item><title>Using Harbor as a Proxy Cache for Cloud-Based Registries</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-12-16-using-harbor-as-a-proxy-cache-for-cloud-based-registries/</link><pubDate>Tue, 16 Dec 2025 11:26:21 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-12-16-using-harbor-as-a-proxy-cache-for-cloud-based-registries/</guid><description>The Problem: Public Registry Challenges Why Use a Proxy Cache?

But what happens when your team scales? What starts as a simple docker pull nginx command can quickly become a bottleneck. docker pull nginx Picture this scenario: Your organization has 50 developers, each running builds multiple times a day. Your CI/CD system spins up fresh containers for every pipeline run. Each environment such as development, staging, and production pulls the same base images repeatedly. All of these pulls hit the public registry directly. Soon, you start experiencing: Rate Limiting Issues: Some public registries limit anonymous users to a specific number pulls per hour. With multiple teams and automated systems, you’ll hit these limits quickly, causing builds to fail with cryptic “too many requests” errors. Slow Build Times: Every pull traverses the internet, adding latency. A 500MB image that could be retrieved from your local network in seconds takes minutes from a public registry. Network Costs: Cloud providers charge for egress traffic. Repeatedly pulling multi-gigabyte images from external registries can result in significant monthly bills.</description></item><item><title>Red Hat to acquire Chatterbox Labs: Frequently Asked Questions</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-12-16-red-hat-to-acquire-chatterbox-labs-frequently-asked-questions/</link><pubDate>Tue, 16 Dec 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-12-16-red-hat-to-acquire-chatterbox-labs-frequently-asked-questions/</guid><description>Red Hat to acquire Chatterbox Labs: Frequently Asked Questions The Announcement Strategic Rationale Customer and Partner Impact About the author Red Hat More like this Looking ahead to 2026: Red Hat’s view across the hybrid cloud Resilient model training on Red Hat OpenShift AI with Kubeflow Trainer Technically Speaking | Platform engineering for AI agents Technically Speaking | Driving healthcare discoveries with AI Browse by channel Automation Artificial intelligence Open hybrid cloud Security Edge computing Infrastructure Applications Virtualization Share On December 16, 2025, Red Hat announced the acquisition of Chatterbox Labs , a pioneer in model-agnostic AI safety and generative AI (gen AI) guardrails.

Across engine upgrades, networking and security enhancements, autoscaling improvements, and new ecosystem integrations, this year’s updates aimed to give teams more power with less operational overhead. Whether users are running production workloads, experimenting with microservices, or scaling customer-facing applications, the enhancements launched throughout 2025 make it easier than ever to deploy, manage, and optimize Kubernetes on DigitalOcean. In this recap, we’ll walk through the major releases that shaped the platform over the past year and how they help developers move faster with confidence. In March, we rolled out four major upgrades to DigitalOcean Kubernetes (DOKS) that make it easier to run larger and more efficient workloads: increased cluster capacity, VPC-native networking, eBPF-powered routing, and Managed Cilium. Here’s a look at each one: Cluster capacity has doubled from 500 to 1,000 worker nodes , allowing bigger applications to run on a single cluster without the overhead of managing multiple environments. Cluster capacity has doubled from 500 to 1,000 worker nodes , allowing bigger applications to run on a single cluster without the overhead of managing multiple environments. VPC-native Kubernetes now assigns IPs directly from your VPC, improving performance and simplifying communication with other cloud resources. Replacing kube-proxy with eBPF-based networking and routing delivers faster packet processing and lower latency, benefiting high-traffic and real-time workloads. Managed Cilium with Hubble for observability adds stronger security, modern networking, and easier troubleshooting. Together, these features significantly boost scalability, performance, and reliability while reducing operational complexity of DOKS, so developers gain clearer visibility and a simpler networking stack, while businesses benefit from lower overhead and the ability to scale applications more efficiently. In July, we introduced four powerful new features to help you build and deploy more efficient applications on DigitalOcean Kubernetes—especially AI and machine-learning workloads.</description></item><item><title>Powering the Next Leap in AI: GPU Droplets accelerated by NVIDIA HGX™ B300 are coming soon to DigitalOcean</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-12-15-powering-the-next-leap-in-ai-gpu-droplets-accelerated-by-nvidia-hgx-b300-are-com/</link><pubDate>Mon, 15 Dec 2025 17:51:51 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-12-15-powering-the-next-leap-in-ai-gpu-droplets-accelerated-by-nvidia-hgx-b300-are-com/</guid><description>Powering the Next Leap in AI: GPU Droplets accelerated by NVIDIA HGX™ B300 are coming soon to DigitalOcean Why NVIDIA HGX™ B300?

Almost any network switch will work with vSAN, but that does not mean they all meet your data center requirements. There are characteristics of modern network switches that you should consider when moving forward with your latest hardware refresh, or new cluster build. Let’s look at what warrants attention, and why these specifications are so important. vSAN is a distributed storage solution. It stores data across hosts in a cluster to ensure data resilience and availability. The hosts that make up a vSAN cluster depend on fast, reliable networking to provide consistent, low latency storage. Figure 1. vSAN’s distributed storage model and its reliance on networking. The dramatic increase in hardware capabilities found in servers over the past two decades is stunning. CPU cores have increased anywhere between 32-128 times of what they were 20 years ago. The same goes for RAM.</description></item><item><title>Friday Five — December 12, 2025</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-12-12-friday-five-december-12-2025/</link><pubDate>Fri, 12 Dec 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-12-12-friday-five-december-12-2025/</guid><description>Friday Five — December 12, 2025 Demystifying llm-d and vLLM: The race to production Forbes - Open Source And Orchestration Will Define Enterprise AI Leadership In 2026 Accelerating open source development with AI CRN - 2025 Products Of The Year Key considerations for 2026 planning: Insights from IDC About the author Red Hat Corporate Communications More like this Solving the scaling challenge: 3 proven strategies for your AI infrastructure From incident responder to security steward: My journey to understanding Red Hat&amp;rsquo;s open approach to vulnerability management Technically Speaking | Platform engineering for AI agents Technically Speaking | Driving healthcare discoveries with AI Keep exploring Browse by channel Automation Artificial intelligence Open hybrid cloud Security Edge computing Infrastructure Applications Virtualization Share As organizations accelerate the journey to production for large language model (LLM) workloads, the ecosystem of open source tools is growing fast.

This constant demand for deep, specialized knowledge across dozens of systems creates inevitable bottlenecks and forces firefighting. This specialization gap is the raison d’être for our field, and there needs to be a way to bridge it. Recently, we found a potential answer in Anthropic SKILLs , and a production MongoDB alert proved its transformative value. Anthropic recently released the concept of a SKILL. Simply put, a SKILL is a way to give an LLM reliable, specialized capabilities that go beyond its general training data. You’re essentially providing the AI with a custom, specialized tool and clear instructions on how and when to use it. It’s the mechanism to transform a general purpose LLM into a highly effective specialist. At Nirmata, we recognized this potential, and immediately integrated support for it in our Nirmata AI platform engineering assistant. Our assistant came pre-loaded with native SKILLs focused on our domain, such as Policy conversion ( OPA to Kyverno , between Kyverno versions), Kyverno policy generation and Chainsaw tests. But the real game-changer is the ability for the agent to discover and learn new SKILLs. The opportunity to test this capability came quickly.</description></item><item><title>From incident responder to security steward: My journey to understanding Red Hat's open approach to vulnerability management</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-12-11-from-incident-responder-to-security-steward-my-journey-to-understanding-red-hat-/</link><pubDate>Thu, 11 Dec 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-12-11-from-incident-responder-to-security-steward-my-journey-to-understanding-red-hat-/</guid><description>From incident responder to security steward: My journey to understanding Red Hat&amp;rsquo;s open approach to vulnerability management 5 ways Red Hat&amp;rsquo;s vulnerability management is different 1.

As a leader of incident response teams, I lived on the front lines, constantly reacting to the latest software vulnerabilities, cyberattacks, and anomalies. My days were a blur of alerts, patch deployments, and the relentless pressure to mitigate risk and restore operations. It was a challenging, high-stakes environment where every vulnerability felt like a direct threat. Now, I&amp;rsquo;ve traded the immediate firefight for a more proactive battlefield as a manager within Red Hat Product Security. This has given me a unique perspective—shifting from addressing vulnerabilities after they occur to understanding how they&amp;rsquo;re managed from the ground up.

Running 1 or 2 models is simple enough. Running dozens, supporting hundreds of users, and keeping GPU costs under control, is something else entirely. Teams often find themselves juggling hardware requests, managing multiple versions of the same model, and trying to deliver performance that actually holds up in production. These are the same kinds of infrastructure and operations challenges we have seen in other workloads, but now applied to AI systems that demand far more resources and coordination. In this post, we look at 3 practical strategies that help organizations solve these scaling problems: GPU-as-a-Service to make better use of expensive GPU hardware Models-as-a-Service to give teams controlled and reliable access to shared models Scalable inference with vLLM and llm-d to achieve production-grade, run-time performance efficiently When moving from proof of concept to production, cost quickly becomes the first barrier. Running large models in production is expensive, especially when training, tuning, and inference workloads all compete for GPU capacity. Control is another challenge. IT teams must balance freedom to experiment with guardrails that strengthen security and compliance.</description></item><item><title>Unlocking Innovation on the Factory Floor: How VMware VCF Edge Empowers OT Citizen Developers</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-12-10-unlocking-innovation-on-the-factory-floor-how-vmware-vcf-edge-empowers-ot-citize/</link><pubDate>Wed, 10 Dec 2025 20:03:31 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-12-10-unlocking-innovation-on-the-factory-floor-how-vmware-vcf-edge-empowers-ot-citize/</guid><description>OT Modernization Challenges VMware VCF Edge: A Unified Platform for Both IT and OT Real-World Impact: The Citizen Developer Workflow The Outcome: Actual Productivity and Faster Modernization Discover more from VMware Cloud Foundation (VCF) Blog Related Articles Unlocking Innovation on the Factory Floor: How VMware VCF Edge Empowers OT Citizen Developers Integrating VMware Data Services Manager with Harbor for a Production-Ready Registry VCF Breakroom Chats Episode 75 - Breaking the GitOps Barrier: Continuous Delivery for Modern Apps with VCF 9 The push for application modernization isn’t just an IT department concern anymore—it’s a fundamental requirement for the modern Operational Technology (OT) environment. Factory floors, energy grids, and logistics hubs are brimming with opportunities for improvement, and the people who know these processes best are your OT experts: the factory workers, engineers, and floor supervisors. They have the knowledge and motivation to optimize their daily operations. The problem? Traditional, complex IT infrastructure has been a towering obstacle to getting their ideas off the ground. For years, operational staff have sought ways to digitize and improve their workflows, often turning to low-code development tools like Node-RED to quickly build applications. These tools are fantastic for rapid prototyping and connecting industrial systems, but they still run into challenges when it comes to deployment, security, and enterprise scale. The primary obstacles for these citizen developers include the following. Complexity of Deployment: Setting up robust, secure, and scalable environments (like Kubernetes clusters or virtual machines) is a full-time IT job, not an OT one. Lack of Unified Support: OT and IT platforms often live in silos, leading to fragmented security, inconsistent management, and painful handoffs. Security and Robustness: A quickly deployed application must run on a secure, reliable foundation that meets industrial uptime and regulatory standards. This is where VMware Cloud Foundation (VCF) Edge completely changes the game. VCF Edge is designed to bring the robustness and management simplicity of the core data center right to your remote or edge sites—whether that’s a factory floor, a retail branch, or a substation.</description></item><item><title>Erasure Codes in VMware vSAN versus Storage Arrays</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-12-10-erasure-codes-in-vmware-vsan-versus-storage-arrays/</link><pubDate>Wed, 10 Dec 2025 13:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-12-10-erasure-codes-in-vmware-vsan-versus-storage-arrays/</guid><description>The Purpose of Erasure Coding Data Storage in vSAN versus a Storage Array Comparing Erasure Codes in vSAN versus Traditional Storage Storage Array vSAN Decoupling Cluster Size and Availability Summary Discover more from VMware Cloud Foundation (VCF) Blog Related Articles Erasure Codes in VMware vSAN versus Storage Arrays Integrating VMware Data Services Manager with Harbor for a Production-Ready Registry NVMe Memory Tiering Design and Sizing on VMware Cloud Foundation 9 Part 3: Sizing for Success Data availability is a core competency of enterprise storage systems. For decades, these systems have attempted to deliver high levels of data availability while ensuring that performance and space efficiency expectations are also met. Achieving all three at the same time is not easy. Erasure coding has played an important role in storing data in a resilient yet space-efficient way. This post will help you better understand how erasure coding is implemented in VMware vSAN, how it is different from what may be found in traditional storage arrays, and how best to interpret an erasure code’s capabilities with data availability. The primary responsibility of any storage system is to give back the bit of data that has been requested. To ensure it can do this reliably, storage systems must store that data in a resilient way. A simple form of data resilience would be through the use of multiple copies, or “mirrors” that would help maintain availability in the event of some type of discrete failure in the storage system, such as a disk in a storage array, or a host in a distributed storage system like vSAN. One of the challenges with this approach is storing full copies of data becomes very costly in terms of capacity consumption. An additional copy would double the amount of data stored, while two additional copies would triple the amount of data stored. Erasure codes are used to store data in a resilient way, but with much more space efficiency relative to traditional mirroring of data. It does not use the approach of copies.</description></item><item><title>Kubernetes v1.33.7</title><link>https://kubermates.org/releases/2025-12-10-kubernetes-v1-33-7/</link><pubDate>Wed, 10 Dec 2025 01:15:27 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/releases/2025-12-10-kubernetes-v1-33-7/</guid><description>See kubernetes-announce@.

But in many enterprises, especially in regulated industries, requesting and receiving a VM can take a staggering 60 to 90 days. This kind of delay can stifle innovation and slow down critical projects. But what if you could provide your developers with a more seamless, self-service experience that delivers a fully configured VM in under an hour, with automated lifecycle management? This isn&amp;rsquo;t a far-off dream, it&amp;rsquo;s a reality you can build with Red Hat&amp;rsquo;s integrated toolset. To transform a slow and manual process into a rapid, automated one, you need 3 key building blocks: A user-friendly portal, a powerful hypervisor, and an intelligent automation engine. The portal: Red Hat Developer Hub provides a single, streamlined user experience (based on Backstage) for requesting any resource, starting with VMs. It&amp;rsquo;s an enterprise-grade, hardened platform with the support complex organizations require. The hypervisor: Red Hat OpenShift Virtualization brings traditional VMs and modern containers together on a single Kubernetes-based platform. Built on KVM, it allows you to manage your entire estate, including legacy Windows and Linux VMs, to cloud-native applications from a unified control plane. The automation engine: Red Hat Ansible Automation Platform is the orchestration engine that ties everything together. It automates every complex, behind-the-scenes task, eliminating manual handoffs that cause delays. Provisioning a VM is just the beginning.</description></item><item><title>Kubernetes v1.35.0-rc.1</title><link>https://kubermates.org/releases/2025-12-09-kubernetes-v1-35-0-rc-1/</link><pubDate>Tue, 09 Dec 2025 19:13:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/releases/2025-12-09-kubernetes-v1-35-0-rc-1/</guid><description>See kubernetes-announce@.

As a cloud-native registry, it is a critical component for any organization leveraging Kubernetes and containerization. In our previous blog , we established that while Harbor includes a built-in PostgreSQL database, this setup is generally not recommended for production use. Deploying a resilient, highly available container registry requires separating the application and database lifecycle to ensure operational excellence. Here are the key reasons why a dedicated, external database is critical for production Harbor deployments: Lack of High Availability (HA): The default internal PostgreSQL setup is typically a single instance, creating a single point of failure. A database pod failure means your entire Harbor instance becomes unavailable. Limited Scalability: An embedded database is not designed for independent scaling. Database performance bottlenecks that arise from growth can be difficult to address without disrupting Harbor itself. Complex Lifecycle Management: Managing critical database operations such as backups, point-in-time recovery, patching, and upgrades directly within an application’s Helm chart is significantly more complex and error-prone than with dedicated database solutions. To address these challenges, we need a highly available PostgreSQL cluster. This is where VMware Data Services Manager (DSM) comes in. VMware Cloud Foundation (VCF) is the private cloud platform that delivers on-premises security, resilience, and performance, providing the underlying infrastructure for modern private cloud environments, including the Kubernetes clusters where applications like Harbor are deployed.</description></item><item><title>Don’t just automate, validate: How to measure and grow your return on investment</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-12-09-don-t-just-automate-validate-how-to-measure-and-grow-your-return-on-investment/</link><pubDate>Tue, 09 Dec 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-12-09-don-t-just-automate-validate-how-to-measure-and-grow-your-return-on-investment/</guid><description>Don’t just automate, validate: How to measure and grow your return on investment Automation dashboard: On-premise visibility Automation analytics: Cloud-based insights and advanced reporting What&amp;rsquo;s next: Scaling automation across the enterprise Gain data-driven insights Translating operational success into personal impact Resources Red Hat Ansible Automation Platform | Product Trial About the author Jaime Biskup More like this Slash VM provisioning time on Red Hat Openshift Virtualization using Red Hat Ansible Automation Platform A 5-step playbook for unified automation and AI Technically Speaking | Taming AI agents with observability Transforming Your Database | Code Comments Keep exploring Browse by channel Automation Artificial intelligence Open hybrid cloud Security Edge computing Infrastructure Applications Virtualization Share Successfully delivering automation demands technical excellence, quality code, and reliable execution. However, scaling this success requires translating those technical wins into measurable business impact that can be communicated to leadership or integrated into business strategy. Red Hat Ansible Automation Platform offers two different capabilities that help practitioners and leaders turn operational metrics into a clear, auditable business case for expansion: Automation dashboard and automation analytics. The automation dashboard provides a comprehensive view of automation performance, enabling you to measure and demonstrate the value of your initiatives. Through the on-premise dashboard, you gain detailed insights into automation usage, job outcomes, and associated financial impact. Key metrics such as job success rates, time savings, and return on investment (ROI) support data-driven decision-making and help identify opportunities to scale automation effectively. With robust customization and reporting capabilities, you can filter, save, export, and share detailed analyses on project performance, user activity, and operational efficiency. Reports can be exported as PDF files for a quick snapshot of the dashboard showing metrics such as cost and time savings, job success and failure rates, and total hours of automation. For deeper analysis, data can also be exported as CSV files and ingested into existing business intelligence (BI) tools to enable detailed reporting. Because the dashboard is a self-contained, on-premise utility, all data remains securely within your environment. It can aggregate data from multiple Ansible Automation Platform instances and is accessible directly in the Ansible interface for system_admin and system_auditor accounts. This makes it ideal when data security is a priority, and when you want local, real-time visibility in your automation performance.</description></item><item><title>How Red Hat OpenShift AI simplifies trust and compliance</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-12-09-how-red-hat-openshift-ai-simplifies-trust-and-compliance/</link><pubDate>Tue, 09 Dec 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-12-09-how-red-hat-openshift-ai-simplifies-trust-and-compliance/</guid><description>How Red Hat OpenShift AI simplifies trust and compliance Moving the platform to the data Compliance as the foundation for scalable AI Zero trust by design End-to-end security capabilities across the stack Continuous compliance and governance Protecting the AI software supply chain Hybrid cloud consistency and compliance, built with choice in mind How compliance enables AI innovation Trust is the currency of AI in the hybrid cloud Red Hat OpenShift AI (Self-Managed) | Product Trial About the author Christopher Nuland More like this Solving the scaling challenge: 3 proven strategies for your AI infrastructure A 5-step playbook for unified automation and AI Technically Speaking | Platform engineering for AI agents Technically Speaking | Driving healthcare discoveries with AI Keep exploring Browse by channel Automation Artificial intelligence Open hybrid cloud Security Edge computing Infrastructure Applications Virtualization Share Artificial intelligence (AI) is reshaping every industry, but in highly regulated sectors, success isn’t measured only by accuracy but also by trust. Public agencies, healthcare providers, and financial institutions face a common challenge of delivering the benefits of AI while staying compliant with frameworks like FedRAMP, HIPAA, PCI DSS, and NIST 800-53. These standards set the rules for encryption, access control, auditing, and data handling. They also introduce operational constraints that limit where and how AI runs. Red Hat OpenShift AI helps to bridge that divide, allowing organizations to build and deploy protected AI where the data lives, across datacenters, public clouds, and edge environments. Regulatory data often can’t move freely. Privacy laws, jurisdictional boundaries, and internal risk policies typically govern how and where clinical records, payment data, and sensitive telemetry can be used. That immobility of the data gravity challenge is one of the most significant barriers to enterprise AI adoption. OpenShift AI reverses that equation. Instead of relocating data to cloud AI services, OpenShift AI brings the AI platform to the data. Since OpenShift AI runs consistently across on-premises, cloud, and edge environments, organizations can train and serve models near sensitive datasets, maintaining compliance, while using flexible compute resources as they see fit. Every platform layer reinforces this trust boundary: encryption, role-based access control (RBAC), network isolation, and continuous compliance scanning.</description></item><item><title>From User to Trusted Advisor: How Jeff Fan Powers Customer Success at DigitalOcean</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-12-08-from-user-to-trusted-advisor-how-jeff-fan-powers-customer-success-at-digitalocea/</link><pubDate>Mon, 08 Dec 2025 16:32:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-12-08-from-user-to-trusted-advisor-how-jeff-fan-powers-customer-success-at-digitalocea/</guid><description>From User to Trusted Advisor: How Jeff Fan Powers Customer Success at DigitalOcean What makes DigitalOcean the right place for you?

There are valid reasons for concern. Our goal in this article, and in Red Hat&amp;rsquo;s own practice, is to address those concerns directly and not dismiss them. Our answers aren&amp;rsquo;t just advice for others—they enable our own engineers, most of whom are open source contributors as well. We&amp;rsquo;ll share with you the guidelines we&amp;rsquo;ve established for Red Hat engineers, based on our use of open source principles in practice. But first, we&amp;rsquo;d like to put the current wave of new tools into context. For the last 4 decades, we&amp;rsquo;ve been regularly implementing new and improved tools and processes for software development. You name it: Compilers, version control systems, IDEs, virtual machines (both kinds), cloud instances, agile development, containers, configuration management, and automated testing. Every set of tools was once new, and many of them triggered heated arguments about authorship, quality, and legitimacy. There was a time when both compiler flags and auto-complete in IDEs were hot-button issues. AI-based development tooling is no different. Nor should it be.</description></item><item><title>Key considerations for 2026 planning: Insights from IDC</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-12-08-key-considerations-for-2026-planning-insights-from-idc/</link><pubDate>Mon, 08 Dec 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-12-08-key-considerations-for-2026-planning-insights-from-idc/</guid><description>Key considerations for 2026 planning: Insights from IDC Your key considerations for 2026 planning The adaptable enterprise: Why AI readiness is disruption readiness About the author Ashesh Badani More like this Sovereignty emerges as the defining cloud challenge for EMEA enterprises Enhance workload security with confidential containers on Azure Red Hat OpenShift Crack the Cloud_Open | Command Line Heroes Edge computing covered and diced | Technically Speaking Keep exploring Browse by channel Automation Artificial intelligence Open hybrid cloud Security Edge computing Infrastructure Applications Virtualization Share As IT leaders and business executives, we&amp;rsquo;re looking beyond the current year to make strategic plans and prepare our organizations for what&amp;rsquo;s next. While AI is, without a doubt, the focus for everyone going into 2026, it&amp;rsquo;s equally important to ensure the underlying technology platforms support your AI adoption strategy and your investment decisions for the future. The choices we make now regarding our technology platforms will directly impact our agility, efficiency, and ability to innovate in the years to come. We&amp;rsquo;re thrilled to see a recent IDC analyst study not only validate but also offer a comprehensive look into the value of an integrated platform approach, providing a great starting point for any organization&amp;rsquo;s future-facing strategy. The IDC paper, The Business Value of Red Hat Hybrid Cloud Solutions , validates that a unified hybrid cloud platform—consisting of a scalable operating system (OS), cloud application development platform, and enterprise-grade automation platform—delivers significant, measurable results and prepares your organization to support your AI adoption strategy. These findings come directly from in-depth interviews with Red Hat customers that have standardized much of their IT operations on our hybrid cloud solutions. Customers achieved: 74% faster business change execution. 38% higher development team productivity, translating to a $54.45 million average annual gain per organization. 60% faster new application development lifecycle. These metrics underscore the importance of choosing a foundational platform that eliminates organizational and technological barriers and boosts efficiency. As one customer noted: “ Instead of managing four vendors for different parts of the stack, we work with one. ” Another emphasized that Red Hat solutions should be a critical consideration for any innovative, AI-ready strategy.</description></item><item><title>DoTs SDK Development: Automating TypeScript Client Generation</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-12-05-dots-sdk-development-automating-typescript-client-generation/</link><pubDate>Fri, 05 Dec 2025 20:10:20 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-12-05-dots-sdk-development-automating-typescript-client-generation/</guid><description>DoTs SDK Development: Automating TypeScript Client Generation Why TypeScript?

As part of that mission, we strive to make our tools and services accessible to developers in their preferred languages. Starting with GoDo , our Go SDK, we made it easy for developers to interact with DigitalOcean resources. Then came PyDo , our Python SDK, expanding support for even more ecosystems. Now, we’re excited to introduce DoTs. Now, our TypeScript SDK empowers developers to leverage TypeScript’s type safety and modern development features, enabling them to manage their DigitalOcean resources. In this blog, we’ll share insights into the making of DoTs and the approach we took to develop it. TypeScript has been a game-changer for modern development, especially when working on large, complex applications. By introducing static type checking, it helps catch errors during compilation, long before they can cause issues in production. This not only improves the reliability and maintainability of the codebase but also saves significant time and effort that would otherwise go into debugging post-deployment. On top of that, TypeScript enhances the developer experience with features like intelligent code completion, inline documentation, and clear error highlighting in IDEs, making the development process smoother and more efficient. Traditionally, building SDKs for new ecosystems required extensive manual effort, including writing boilerplate code in multiple programming languages.</description></item><item><title>Friday Five — December 5, 2025</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-12-05-friday-five-december-5-2025/</link><pubDate>Fri, 05 Dec 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-12-05-friday-five-december-5-2025/</guid><description>Friday Five — December 5, 2025 Red Hat to deliver enhanced AI inference across AWS Technically Speaking with Chris Wright: Platform engineering for AI agents ft.

Many are attempting to build their own automation solutions, cobbling together a patchwork of tools that, while well-intentioned, can actually make things worse. Red Hat dug into this with S&amp;amp;P Global Market Intelligence 451 Research, and their findings point to a simpler alternative : use a unified platform instead of patchworking tools together. Most teams are drowning in tools, often ending up with too many dashboards with too little coordination. A remarkable 72% of organizations are using up to 50 different IT tools, while nearly a third (28%) are managing over 50. This fragmented approach creates significant hurdles for effective IT automation, including: Complex implementations : This is a top obstacle for 58% of organizations. We often see this arise when customers deploy too many resources and move components piecemeal, slowing progress and increasing effort. Integration challenges : Integrating existing systems is a challenge for 51% of IT organizations. This isn&amp;rsquo;t just about connecting tools, it&amp;rsquo;s about achieving true interoperability for automation workflows. Skills gaps : 40% of respondents point to specific skills shortages. Maintaining expertise across a vast array of different tools is a constant drain on time and resources.

The official publication of the new CIS Benchmark ® for Red Hat OpenShift Virtualization is an important development for organizations running traditional virtual machines (VMs) alongside modern containers. OpenShift Virtualization is a feature of Red Hat OpenShift that allows existing VM-based workloads to run directly on the platform. This globally recognized, consensus-driven benchmark provides recommendations for creating a security-focused configuration for those environments. CIS is a community-driven nonprofit organization, which aims to &amp;ldquo;make the connected world a safer place&amp;rdquo; for businesses, governments, and people by developing and promoting best practice solutions. The CIS Benchmarks are one of those core solutions. They are a set of globally recognized best practices to help secure configuring operating systems (OSs), servers, and other technology. Developed and maintained by a global community of IT professionals, the CIS Benchmarks provide prescriptive instructions for creating a security-focused configuration baseline. The new CIS Benchmark for OpenShift Virtualization was developed based on the OpenShift Virtualization Hardening Guide. The CIS Benchmark provides detailed recommendations to strengthen your security posture by focusing on 4 key areas of optimization, including: Harden the platform from the ground up : This includes guidance on restricting GPU and USB pass-through to approved devices and disabling non-essential feature gates. Control workloads at every layer : The CIS Benchmark provides fine-grained controls, such as restricting exec and virtual network computing (VNC) access to approved administrators and disabling features like guest-memory overcommit. Segment and protect network traffic : This area focuses on using networking controls like Virtual Local Area Networks (VLANs) to isolate tenant or application traffic and applying Media Access Control (MAC) spoof filtering.</description></item><item><title>From vision to reality: A 5-step playbook for unified automation and AI</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-12-04-from-vision-to-reality-a-5-step-playbook-for-unified-automation-and-ai/</link><pubDate>Thu, 04 Dec 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-12-04-from-vision-to-reality-a-5-step-playbook-for-unified-automation-and-ai/</guid><description>From vision to reality: A 5-step playbook for unified automation and AI 1.

This widespread adoption of disparate solutions, often driven by a &amp;ldquo;do it yourself&amp;rdquo; mentality, can lead to overwhelming tool sprawl. The resulting lack of interoperability directly hinders innovation, fragments data insights, and ultimately undermines the effective delivery of AI solutions. As automation and AI become increasingly interdependent, systems must be capable of cohesive information exchange. This critical need points directly to platform engineering (PE), which enables self-service capabilities through a, &amp;ldquo;bidirectional exchange of both data and workflows,&amp;rdquo; between tools. A unified automation platform isn&amp;rsquo;t merely a convenience, it&amp;rsquo;s the strategic foundation for AI development and deployment. Take a moment to evaluate your organization&amp;rsquo;s automation maturity: Are your IT operations bogged down by manual, repetitive tasks across various domains: Network, security, cloud, and infrastructure? Do different teams (IT Ops, DevOps, SecOps, Network Ops, Line of Business) grapple with inconsistent automation tools and processes, fostering silos and inefficiency? Is your current automation fragmented, making it challenging to scale or maintain consistency across hybrid and multicloud environments? Can you accurately measure the ROI of your automation efforts, and pinpoint where automation could deliver the most significant time and cost savings? Do you have a clear strategy for integrating emerging technologies like AI into your IT operations? Is your automation foundation truly prepared to support these initiatives? The next hurdle is effectively articulating the value of a unified platform to your stakeholders and decision-makers.</description></item><item><title>Getting Started with OpenShift Virtualization</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-12-04-getting-started-with-openshift-virtualization/</link><pubDate>Thu, 04 Dec 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-12-04-getting-started-with-openshift-virtualization/</guid><description>Getting Started with OpenShift Virtualization Install OpenShift and virtualization operators Create a new VM 1.

Whether you&amp;rsquo;re looking to migrate away from your current virtualization platform or you&amp;rsquo;re just looking for a unified platform for both VMs and containers, Red Hat OpenShift is a centralized control center for all the services you provide to your users. Here&amp;rsquo;s how to get started with OpenShift Virtualization, a feature of Red Hat OpenShift. To use OpenShift Virtualization, you must have access to a bare metal OpenShift cluster. There are several ways to install OpenShift: Interactive : Deploy a cluster with the web-based Assisted Installer. This provides smart and safe defaults, and performs several pre-flight validations before installing a cluster. Local agent : In an air-gapped or network-restricted environment, you can deploy a cluster locally with the agent-based installer. Automated : Deploy a cluster on infrastructure provisioned by the installer using your host&amp;rsquo;s baseboard management controller (BMC). Full control : Deploy a cluster on your own infrastructure.</description></item><item><title>Red Hat OpenShift sandboxed containers 1.11 and Red Hat build of Trustee 1.0 accelerate confidential computing across the hybrid cloud</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-12-04-red-hat-openshift-sandboxed-containers-1-11-and-red-hat-build-of-trustee-1-0-acc/</link><pubDate>Thu, 04 Dec 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-12-04-red-hat-openshift-sandboxed-containers-1-11-and-red-hat-build-of-trustee-1-0-acc/</guid><description>Red Hat OpenShift sandboxed containers 1.11 and Red Hat build of Trustee 1.0 accelerate confidential computing across the hybrid cloud OpenShift sandboxed containers 1.11: A focus on security and enterprise readiness Red Hat build of Trustee 1.0: Simplifying the configuration and deployment Production-ready on Azure: Confidential containers GA on Azure Red Hat OpenShift Expanding to bare metal: Technology preview for Intel TDX and AMD SEV-SNP Real-world use cases and problems solved What&amp;rsquo;s next Try confidential containers on OpenShift today Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform | Product Trial About the authors Ariel Adam Marcos Entenza Jens Freimann Danilo de Paula More like this File encryption and decryption made easy with GPG Deploy Confidential Computing on AWS Nitro Enclaves with Red Hat Enterprise Linux What Is Product Security? | Compiler Technically Speaking | Security for the AI supply chain Keep exploring Browse by channel Automation Artificial intelligence Open hybrid cloud Security Edge computing Infrastructure Applications Virtualization Share Red Hat is excited to announce the release of Red Hat OpenShift sandboxed containers 1.11 and Red Hat build of Trustee 1.0, marking a significant milestone in our confidential computing journey.

This complexity makes efficient management and integration a significant obstacle, especially as organizations accelerate their investment in hybrid IT ecosystems, cloud services, and cloud-native application modernization. To help overcome this &amp;ldquo;tool sprawl&amp;rdquo; and its impact on productivity, enterprises are working to establish a common environment for orchestrating and managing critical IT processes—a &amp;ldquo;unified IT automation platform. &amp;quot; To understand the business imperatives driving this shift, we asked S&amp;amp;P Global Market Intelligence 451 Research to conduct a comprehensive survey with 900 business and IT decision-makers and influencers. These leaders provided their perspectives on the current state of IT automation, anticipated changes, and the implications of relying on so many different tools. These insights also helped shape our understanding of the definition and expectations for a unified IT automation platform. Automation challenges: The journey to stable and reliable IT automation isn&amp;rsquo;t without its challenges. The top hurdles identified by respondents were complex and lengthy implementation processes , cited by a substantial 58%, closely followed by integration with existing systems and software, at 51%. Budget constraints (44%) and skills shortages (40%) also pose obstacles. Excess IT tooling: The pervasive challenge of tool sprawl is evident, with 42% of respondents reporting the use of 26-50 different tools, with 28% reporting more than 50 tools in their toolbox. This fragmentation underscores the need for enhanced tool interoperability. Encouragingly, a significant two-thirds (69%) of enterprises have already established platform engineering programs or are actively committing resources to integrate these tools through a unified orchestration layer.</description></item><item><title>Kubernetes v1.35.0-rc.0</title><link>https://kubermates.org/releases/2025-12-03-kubernetes-v1-35-0-rc-0/</link><pubDate>Wed, 03 Dec 2025 06:27:07 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/releases/2025-12-03-kubernetes-v1-35-0-rc-0/</guid><description>See kubernetes-announce@.

For machine learning (ML) workloads, ROSA now supports On-Demand Capacity Reservations (ODCR) and Capacity Blocks for ML, allowing cloud architects and platform administrators to strategically utilize their existing AWS purchases to help deliver uninterrupted access to essential compute infrastructure. Today, ROSA is available in over 30 regions and supports over 600 instance types, allowing customers to run diverse workloads according to their business needs. However, maintaining guaranteed or uninterrupted access to a specific infrastructure type in a particular availability zone (AZ) is important for several critical scenarios: GPU-based accelerated computing workloads: Gaining uninterrupted access to accelerated computing (GPU) instances is vital for AI/ML teams conducting training, fine-tuning, or inference workloads. Capacity reservation helps eliminate the risk of compute unavailability for these time-sensitive, resource-intensive tasks. Planned scaling events: Enabling infrastructure scaling events to confidently support planned business events—such as peak traffic seasons, major product launches, or scheduled batch processing—without provisioning delays. High availability and disaster recovery: Enhancing resiliency by guaranteeing capacity when deploying workloads across multiple AZs or executing disaster recovery protocols across regions. Amazon EC2 Capacity Reservations allow you to reserve compute capacity for your Amazon EC2 instances in a specific AZ for any duration. Capacity Blocks for ML allow you to reserve GPU-based accelerated computing instances on a future date to support your short duration ML workloads. With the support for Capacity Reservations for clusters with hosted control planes (HCP), platform administrators can now create ROSA machine pools in their cluster that directly consume the capacity already reserved with AWS. Key best practices for effectively leveraging Capacity Reservations with ROSA: Pre-planning of AZs, instance types, and capacity: Before creation, ensure a precise match between the reserved capacity and the ROSA machine pool attributes. This includes VPC subnets, the number of node replicas, and the instance type.</description></item><item><title>VMware Cloud on AWS: What’s New (December 2025)</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-12-02-vmware-cloud-on-aws-what-s-new-december-2025/</link><pubDate>Tue, 02 Dec 2025 18:58:50 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-12-02-vmware-cloud-on-aws-what-s-new-december-2025/</guid><description>Optimize Your SDDC Deployments: Stretched Cluster Enhancements Non-Stretched Secondary Clusters in Stretched SDDCs Some key benefits include: Improved Scale-Down Options for Stretched Clusters Key use cases: Take Control of Your Data: New Host Usage Report API Product Enhancement: HCX version 4.11.3 Now Available for VMC What’s New in HCX 4.11.3?

Over the past few months, we’ve released several updates to make VMware Cloud on AWS (VMC) more flexible and easier to use. It’s easy to miss the latest updates on our release notes , so we want to use this opportunity to highlight some of the most recent feature releases. Our latest features provide enterprise customers more cost-efficient resilience with non-stretched secondary clusters and improved scale-down, clearer operational insights via a redesigned user interface, an improved VMC Sizer, and new Host Usage APIs, and continued product enhancements through HCX 4.11.3. Here’s a look at what’s new. When you deploy a Software Defined Datacenter (SDDC) in VMC, you are given the choice of either a standard or a stretched SDDC deployment. While a standard cluster is deployed in a single AWS availability zone (AZ), a stretched cluster offers improved availability by deploying the SDDC across three AWS availability zones. Two of the availability zones are selected for the instance deployments and the third hosts the vSAN witness component. Because SDDCs in stretched clusters deploy hosts in two AWS availability zones, they require customers to size at two to one for their resource needs. This can be cost prohibitive for workloads that don’t require high availability. Additionally, once stretched clusters have been scaled beyond six hosts, they were previously unable to scale back down. To improve both of these experiences, the VMC team has introduced Non-Stretched Secondary Clusters in Stretched Cluster SDDCs and Improved Scale-Down Options for Stretched Clusters.</description></item><item><title>v1.36.0-alpha.0</title><link>https://kubermates.org/releases/2025-12-02-v1-36-0-alpha-0/</link><pubDate>Tue, 02 Dec 2025 16:12:28 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/releases/2025-12-02-v1-36-0-alpha-0/</guid><description>Choose a tag to compare Sorry, something went wrong.

More than 9,000 attendees gathered in Atlanta, with nearly half joining for the first time, reflecting the accelerating global adoption of Kubernetes and open source innovation. For Broadcom, KubeCon is where we connect directly with the community that has shaped Kubernetes from its earliest days. It’s where we learn, share, and collaborate on the technologies that define modern cloud infrastructure. Here are the major themes that stood out this year and how we are helping customers take advantage of what’s next. A clear message emerged among a number of the keynotes and technical sessions: The future of AI is cloud native, and the future of cloud native is AI. Whether it was Adobe’s “Maximum Acceleration” keynote, Niantic’s real-time ML workflows, or Cohere’s enterprise AI architecture, it became evident that Kubernetes has become the foundation for training, serving, and governing AI models. These were some of the main takeaways : Inference is still the dominant enterprise AI workload, projected to drive hundreds of billions in investment over the next decade AI workloads need portability and interoperability across data centers and public clouds DRA (Dynamic Resource Allocation) is now the standard Kubernetes API for orchestrating accelerators and other specialized resources including GPUs, networking interfaces, and fine-grained CPI sharing. This is now GA in Kubernetes v1.34 Multi-cluster and multi-cloud operations are becoming standard patterns For more than two decades, we have engineered the operational foundations now required for large-scale AI: predictable scheduling, isolation boundaries, memory and CPU efficiency, and robust lifecycle automation. These strengths directly support the direction Kubernetes is heading. Our upstream work, including etcd improvements, leadership on long-term lifecycle stability, conformance engagement, and contributions across SIGs ensures our platforms adopt these emerging AI-native standards in a way enterprises can trust. This year, the CNCF formally launched Kubernetes AI Conformance, validating the essential set of capabilities required for portable and interoperable AI workloads.</description></item><item><title>NVMe Memory Tiering Design and Sizing on VMware Cloud Foundation 9 Part 3: Sizing for Success</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-12-02-nvme-memory-tiering-design-and-sizing-on-vmware-cloud-foundation-9-part-3-sizing/</link><pubDate>Tue, 02 Dec 2025 12:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-12-02-nvme-memory-tiering-design-and-sizing-on-vmware-cloud-foundation-9-part-3-sizing/</guid><description>Discover more from VMware Cloud Foundation (VCF) Blog Related Articles NVMe Memory Tiering Design and Sizing on VMware Cloud Foundation 9 Part 3: Sizing for Success Making Harbor Production-Ready: Essential Considerations for Deployment Reducing Harbor Deployment Complexity on Kubernetes So far in this blog series, we have highlighted the value that NVMe Memory Tiering delivers to our customers and how this is driving adoption. Who doesn’t want to reduce their cost by ~40% just by adopting VMware Cloud Foundation 9?! We’ve also touched on pre-requisites, and hardware in Part 1 , and design in Part 2 ; so, let’s now talk about properly sizing your environment so you can maximize your investment while reducing your cost. Proper sizing for NVMe Memory Tiering is mainly on the hardware side, but there are two possible ways to look at this; greenfield and brownfield deployments. Let’s start with brownfield deployments, which is adopting Memory Tiering on existing infrastructure. You’ve came to the realization that VCF 9 is truly an integrated product delivering a cohesive cloud like solution and decided to deploy it but just learned about Memory Tiering. Don’t worry, you can still introduce NVMe memory Tiering after deployment of VCF 9. After reading Part 1 and Part 2, we’ve learned the importance of the NVMe performance and endurance classes as well as the understanding the 50% active memory requirement. This means that we need to think about purchasing an NVMe device that is at least the same size of our DRAM, since we will double our memory capacity. So, if each of your hosts have 1TB of DRAM we should at least have 1TB NVMe devices, easy enough. However, we can go bigger and still be cheaper than buying more DIMMS, let me explain. I’ve made it a point to say “buy an NVMe device to be at least the same size of DRAM”, and this is because we use a DRAM:NVMe ratio of 1:1 by default, so half of the memory comes from DRAM and half comes from NVMe. Now, there are workloads that may not be doing a whole lot as far as memory activity, think some VDI workloads.</description></item><item><title>Making Harbor Production-Ready: Essential Considerations for Deployment</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-12-02-making-harbor-production-ready-essential-considerations-for-deployment/</link><pubDate>Tue, 02 Dec 2025 11:58:04 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-12-02-making-harbor-production-ready-essential-considerations-for-deployment/</guid><description>&lt;ol&gt;

To learn more about Harbor and how to deploy it on a Virtual Machine (VM) and in Kubernetes (K8s), refer to parts 1 and 2 of the series. While deploying Harbor is straightforward, making it production-ready requires careful consideration of several key aspects. This blog outlines critical factors to ensure your Harbor instance is robust, secure, and scalable for production environments. For this blog, we will focus on upstream Harbor (v 2.14) deployed on Kubernetes via Helm as our base and provide suggestions for this specific deployment. For a production environment, single points of failure are unacceptable. This is especially true for image registries that acts as a central repository for storing and pulling images and artifacts.&lt;/li&gt;

Red Hat OpenShift Virtualization, combined with Red Hat OpenShift Service on AWS (ROSA), supports hardware overcommit in the cloud, allowing customers to run more virtual machines (VMs) on fewer cloud resources. By aligning resource consumption more closely to actual usage patterns, organizations can significantly reduce compute costs. This provides a practical way to consolidate VM footprints and maximize the value of cloud investments. Customers can also take advantage of AWS buying programs to further improve cost efficiency. ROSA supports pay-as-you-go pricing, the use of existing AWS cloud committed spend agreements, reserved instances, savings plans and, of course, unified billing. These options offer multiple paths to align OpenShift consumption with financial planning strategies and help organizations convert Red Hat software and managed site reliability engineering (SRE) services into predictable, planned expenditures. Operational efficiency is another key benefit. ROSA is jointly supported by Red Hat and AWS, and Red Hat SRE teams manage the day-to-day operations of the service. This includes upgrades, monitoring, scaling, and incident response. Offloading these activities can help reduce infrastructure management efforts and free teams to focus on delivering applications, accelerating time to value. For organizations adopting AI and GPU-accelerated workloads, ROSA offers additional scalability and cost advantages when compared to on-premise environments.</description></item><item><title>VMware Cloud Foundation Automation – Consume and Deploy Virtual Machines and Kubernetes Clusters</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-12-01-vmware-cloud-foundation-automation-consume-and-deploy-virtual-machines-and-kuber/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Dec 2025 16:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-12-01-vmware-cloud-foundation-automation-consume-and-deploy-virtual-machines-and-kuber/</guid><description>Virtual Machine Service vSphere Kubernetes Service Summary Discover more from VMware Cloud Foundation (VCF) Blog Related Articles VCF Breakroom Chats Episode 75 - Breaking the GitOps Barrier: Continuous Delivery for Modern Apps with VCF 9 VMware Cloud Foundation Automation – Consume and Deploy Virtual Machines and Kubernetes Clusters VCF Breakroom Chats Episode 74 - From VI Admin to Private Cloud Architect: New VCAP &amp;amp; VCDX Certification Explained In our previous blog , we talked about how an organization admin leveraging VMware Cloud Foundation Automation enables their organization to be effectively ready for application teams to self-serve and provision infrastructure and applications. In this blog, we are going to shed light on two foundational infrastructure services that are enabled and available out of the box when configuring the tenant organization that leverages the K8S Style API: the Virtual Machine Service and the vSphere Kubernetes Service. The Kubernetes declarative API model has already transformed the way organizations build and operate modern applications. But in recent years, the same Kubernetes model has been extended beyond containerized workloads into the world of infrastructure itself. What started with kubectl apply for Pods and Deployments has evolved into using Kubernetes APIs to provision and manage virtual machines, K8S clusters, networking, storage, load balancers, and even databases. Kubernetes is no longer “just the platform for cloud-native apps. ” It’s steadily becoming the universal control plane for both applications and infrastructure. kubectl apply The Virtual Machine (VM) Service in VMware Cloud Foundation 9.0 provides a unified, Kubernetes-native interface for provisioning and managing VMs directly through namespaces. By exposing VM classes, images, storage policies, and networking configurations as declarative Kubernetes resources, the VM Service enables platform and application teams to consume vSphere-backed compute using familiar Kubernetes tooling. This service ensures consistent governance and lifecycle management by enforcing the policies defined at the organization, region, and project levels in VCF Automation, while leveraging vSphere’s mature virtualization capabilities underneath. Below is a detailed walkthrough of the VM provisioning workflow experience in VMware Cloud Foundation Automation. The vSphere Kubernetes Service (VKS) in VMware Cloud Foundation 9.0 delivers a fully integrated, upstream-compatible Kubernetes control plane that runs natively on vSphere.</description></item><item><title>Frequently asked questions about Red Hat Ansible Automation Platform 2.6</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-12-01-frequently-asked-questions-about-red-hat-ansible-automation-platform-2-6/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Dec 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-12-01-frequently-asked-questions-about-red-hat-ansible-automation-platform-2-6/</guid><description>Frequently asked questions about Red Hat Ansible Automation Platform 2.6 Installations, upgrades, and migrations Automation dashboard Ansible Lightspeed intelligent assistant Self-service automation portal Additional resources Red Hat Ansible Automation Platform | Product Trial About the author Tricia McConnell More like this A 5-step playbook for unified automation and AI AI ambitions meet automation reality: The case for a unified automation platform Technically Speaking | Taming AI agents with observability You Can&amp;rsquo;t Automate Buy-In | Code Comments Keep exploring Browse by channel Automation Artificial intelligence Open hybrid cloud Security Edge computing Infrastructure Applications Virtualization Share Last month, we launched Red Hat Ansible Automation Platform 2.6, and introduced several new features including an automation dashboard, a self-service automation portal, and the Ansible Lightspeed intelligent assistant.

Is there documentation for installing or migrating to Ansible Automation Platform 2.6? Red Hat&amp;rsquo;s official product documentation for Ansible Automation Platform 2.6 provides an installation guide to help you get up and running. If you&amp;rsquo;re migrating a previous install to the latest version, read our 2.6 migration documentation. For a quick overview of the process, read this installation and upgrade blog. When moving from using RPM to containerized installations, do I need three separate VMs for service containers (automation controller, database, and automation hub)? Yes, we still recommend having one VM instance for each service container. See the installation and migration guides above. There are additional changes, so be sure to review the tested deployment models. Can I upgrade or migrate 2.4 (RPM) on host A to 2.6 (containerized) on host B? First upgrade to 2.6, then migrate to the containerized installation. Is a database with high availability (HA) available in Ansible Automation Platform 2.6? Red Hat does not provide HA solutions.</description></item><item><title>Kubernetes v1.35 Sneak Peek</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-11-26-kubernetes-v1-35-sneak-peek/</link><pubDate>Wed, 26 Nov 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-11-26-kubernetes-v1-35-sneak-peek/</guid><description>Kubernetes v1.35 Sneak Peek Deprecations and removals for Kubernetes v1.35 cgroup v1 support Deprecation of ipvs mode in kube-proxy Kubernetes is deprecating containerd v1. y support Featured enhancements of Kubernetes v1.35 Node declared features In-place update of Pod resources Pod certificates Numeric values for taints User namespaces Support for mounting OCI images as volumes Want to know more? Get involved As the release of Kubernetes v1.35 approaches, the Kubernetes project continues to evolve. Features may be deprecated, removed, or replaced to improve the project&amp;rsquo;s overall health. This blog post outlines planned changes for the v1.35 release that the release team believes you should be aware of to ensure the continued smooth operation of your Kubernetes cluster(s), and to keep you up to date with the latest developments. The information below is based on the current status of the v1.35 release and is subject to change before the final release date. On Linux nodes, container runtimes typically rely on cgroups (short for &amp;ldquo;control groups&amp;rdquo;). Support for using cgroup v2 has been stable in Kubernetes since v1.25, providing an alternative to the original v1 cgroup support. While cgroup v1 provided the initial resource control mechanism, it suffered from well-known inconsistencies and limitations. Adding support for cgroup v2 allowed use of a unified control group hierarchy, improved resource isolation, and served as the foundation for modern features, making legacy cgroup v1 support ready for removal. The removal of cgroup v1 support will only impact cluster administrators running nodes on older Linux distributions that do not support cgroup v2; on those nodes, the kubelet will fail to start. Administrators must migrate their nodes to systems with cgroup v2 enabled. More details on compatibility requirements will be available in a blog post soon after the v1.35 release.</description></item><item><title>Streamline Your Workflow: Announcing Environment Support for DigitalOcean App Platform</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-11-25-streamline-your-workflow-announcing-environment-support-for-digitalocean-app-pla/</link><pubDate>Tue, 25 Nov 2025 16:06:22 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-11-25-streamline-your-workflow-announcing-environment-support-for-digitalocean-app-pla/</guid><description>Streamline Your Workflow: Announcing Environment Support for DigitalOcean App Platform The Core Concept Configuring Environments in the UI Managing Environments with doctl Step 1: Create an Environment-Tagged Project Step 2: Create an App and Assign it to the Project Step 3: Find an App’s Environment Accelerate Your Workflow with App Cloning Start Organizing About the author(s) Try DigitalOcean for free Related Articles Evaluate your AI agents faster and more effectively GPU Observability: Get Deeper Insights into Your Droplets and DOKS Clusters Image and audio models from fal now available on DigitalOcean By Waverly Swinton and Bikram Gupta Published: November 25, 2025 5 min read As developers, we love building, but we also know that as an application portfolio grows, managing it gets complicated. The line between your production services, your staging environment, and your new feature-branch deployments can blur. Keeping track of which app serves which purpose and quickly identifying all your “production” apps at a glance becomes a significant organizational challenge. We’re excited to announce a powerful new way to manage this complexity: Environment Support for DigitalOcean App Platform, powered by DigitalOcean Projects. We’re also introducing App Cloning , a new feature to replicate your apps in just a few clicks. This feature allows you to explicitly tag your resource groups (Projects) with a specific environment, such as Development, Staging, or Production and then assign your App Platform apps to those projects. This gives you a high-level, filterable view of your entire application landscape, right from the control panel and via the CLI. The logic is simple but effective: A Project is a “bucket” for your resources. You can group Droplets, Load Balancers, Databases, and App Platform Apps into a single Project. A Project is a “bucket” for your resources. You can group Droplets, Load Balancers, Databases, and App Platform Apps into a single Project.

Deploying Harbor is a common and critical step for organizations looking to streamline their containerization workflows. As we discussed in our previous blog post , Harbor offers significant value through its comprehensive features and can be deployed on a virtual machine (VM). This blog post will pick up where we left off, guiding you through the process of deploying Harbor on an upstream conformant Kubernetes platform using VMware vSphere Kubernetes Service (VKS) as an example first via Helm, then via VKS standard packages, and finally showcasing the simplified deployment as a supervisor service in VMware Cloud Foundation (VCF) 9. This progression highlights how complexity is progressively reduced at each level. If you are interested to learn more about Harbor and how to deploy it on a VM, check out our previous blog. Before diving into the specifics of VKS, let’s briefly outline the general steps for deploying the bare-minimum components of Harbor on any standard Kubernetes cluster (non production-ready). This foundational understanding will help you grasp the components involved.

While the upgrade from 5. x is designed to be streamlined, it introduces mandatory changes in management methodologies and requires careful, phased execution. I’ve previously shared the typical process that VCF Professional Services uses to perform upgrades to VCF 9.0. In my recent webinar with Brent Douglas , I walked through the process (with demos!) of upgrading VCF 5.2 to VCF 9.0. You can find the full webinar replay at the end of this blog, but here are some of the highlights. The webinar starts with an overview of VCF 9.0. This release introduces a unified platform designed to manage both traditional VMs and modern container-based Kubernetes workloads from a single foundation. The new “fleet” construct fundamentally changes how multiple VCF instances are managed, enabling centralized automation and operations across geographically dispersed or logically grouped private clouds. Expanded multi-site, multi-rack, and stretched cluster topologies are now officially supported and documented. VMware SDDC Manager, although currently still available, is being deprecated. Its functions, such as licensing, certificates, and password management, have been migrated to VMware Cloud Foundation Operations which is now a mandatory component in VCF 9.0.</description></item><item><title>Operationalizing the Edge with VMware Cloud Foundation</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-11-20-operationalizing-the-edge-with-vmware-cloud-foundation/</link><pubDate>Thu, 20 Nov 2025 16:22:21 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-11-20-operationalizing-the-edge-with-vmware-cloud-foundation/</guid><description>Now Available: A Fully Automated Deployment Script for Edge Key Benefits of the Automation Script What to Expect from the Script This automation script will cover the following key functions: A Unified Cloud Operating Model from Core to Edge Learn More: Discover more from VMware Cloud Foundation (VCF) Blog Related Articles Operationalizing the Edge with VMware Cloud Foundation VMware Cloud Foundation is the Gold Standard for Virtual Desktop Infrastructure VCF Breakroom Chats Episode 73 - Next-Gen Data Services: The DBaaS Revolution with VCF 9 As organizations extend operations beyond the data center, the edge has become a vital part of their digital strategy. Whether in retail outlets, manufacturing plants, healthcare facilities, energy plants or remote branch offices, IT teams want infrastructure that delivers cloud like agility, consistency and unified operations in the most resource-constrained environments. With VMware Cloud Foundation 9.0 for Edge, a single-host edge site deployment powered by VMware vSphere Supervisor enables organizations to run both VMs and container workloads on the same platform, eliminating the need for separate infrastructure and reducing cost and operational complexity in resource-constrained edge environments. VCF 9.0 also introduces a GitOps model powered by Argo CD Operator, using a centrally managed Git repository as the source of truth, organizations can drive consistent, repeatable and automatically reconciled deployments of VMs and container workloads across multiple distributed edge sites from a single repository simplifying and scaling management across thousands of edge sites. The journey to modernize the edge, as we’ve explored in our previous posts, has paved the way for robust, simplified infrastructure. We’ve introduced the power of the single-node vSphere Supervisor architecture in our series, starting with the Modernizing Your Edge with Single Node vSphere Supervisor blogs. Following that, we demonstrated how application deployment at scale is achieved using a GitOps approach with Argo CD in VCF 9.0 for Edge – Automating App Deployment at Scale with GitOps Using Argo CD. Now, it’s time to bring these concepts together and address the crucial next step: accelerating the infrastructure deployment itself. A core challenge for distributed edge sites is the consistent, rapid, and error-free provisioning of the underlying hardware and software stack. A fully automated deployment script is now available, enabling customers to deploy a single-host vSphere Supervisor environment with Argo CD automation. Automating deployment of vSphere Supervisor and Argo CD at scale minimizes setup time, standardizes configurations, and improves consistency across distributed edge locations. This new automation script streamlines everything from initial cluster configuration to continuous application delivery, helping organizations operationalize the edge faster and more reliably.</description></item><item><title>Mapping VLAN Tags to Virtual Private Cloud Subnets</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-11-20-mapping-vlan-tags-to-virtual-private-cloud-subnets/</link><pubDate>Thu, 20 Nov 2025 15:49:06 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-11-20-mapping-vlan-tags-to-virtual-private-cloud-subnets/</guid><description>Traditional Guest VLAN Tagging (Trunking) Guest VLAN Tagging on NSX Overlay Segments Implementing VLAN-to-Subnet Mapping in a VPC Key Benefits of Subnet-Level Mapping Discover more from VMware Cloud Foundation (VCF) Blog Related Articles Mapping VLAN Tags to Virtual Private Cloud Subnets Unified Authentication in VMware Cloud Foundation SDK 9.0: Seamless authentication across vSphere and vSAN APIs NVMe Memory Tiering Design and Sizing on VMware Cloud Foundation 9 Part 2: Design for Security, Redundancy, and Scalability In a typical virtualized environment, a VM sends untagged traffic from its virtual NIC (vNIC). By default, the virtual switch drops any traffic that carries an 802. 1Q VLAN tag. To allow this traffic, a feature known as Guest VLAN Tagging (GVT) must be explicitly enabled on the vNIC’s port connection. Let’s review how this is traditionally handled before diving into the simple and powerful method available in Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) subnets. On a vSphere Distributed Port Group (dvPortGroup) or a VLAN-backed NSX segment, GVT is enabled by configuring the port as a trunk. This involves specifying a range of allowed VLAN IDs instead of just one. In this trunking model, traffic sent by a VM with VLAN tag X is forwarded onto the physical network, still tagged with VLAN X. The physical network infrastructure is then responsible for handling that tagged traffic. Enabling GVT on an NSX overlay segment (configuring a VLAN range) works similarly at first. Traffic from a VM with a VLAN tag is injected into the overlay segment while retaining its tag. Because NSX sees tagged frames, it treats this as simple Layer 2 traffic.</description></item><item><title>Integrating Red Hat Lightspeed in 2025: From observability to actionable automation</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-11-20-integrating-red-hat-lightspeed-in-2025-from-observability-to-actionable-automati/</link><pubDate>Thu, 20 Nov 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-11-20-integrating-red-hat-lightspeed-in-2025-from-observability-to-actionable-automati/</guid><description>Integrating Red Hat Lightspeed in 2025: From observability to actionable automation Security-focused, scalable API access with service account authentication Introducing the MCP Server: A new way to connect Red Hat Lightspeed and AI workflows Expanded integrations across ITSM, observability, and automation ServiceNow flow templates for Red Hat Lightspeed PagerDuty integration Event-Driven Ansible collection Red Hat Satellite and Ansible Automation Platform integrations Putting it all together Looking ahead Red Hat Ansible Automation Platform | Product Trial About the author Jerome Marc More like this Red Hat Ansible Certified Collection for amazon. ai: Automate AI Infrastructure Setting up logrotate in Linux Technically Speaking | Taming AI agents with observability You Can’t Automate Collaboration | Code Comments Keep exploring Browse by channel Automation Artificial intelligence Open hybrid cloud Security Edge computing Infrastructure Applications Virtualization Share Red Hat Lightspeed (formerly Red Hat Insights) has long helped operations teams detect risks, open tickets, and share findings with the right tools, connecting proactive intelligence to everyday workflows. Much has changed, not only in Red Hat Lightspeed itself, but also in how organizations are using it. Across industries, teams have built custom dashboards, reporting portals, and IT service management (ITSM) integrations powered by the Red Hat Lightspeed API. Others have connected Red Hat Lightspeed data into continuous integration and delivery (CI/CD) pipelines, monitoring environments, and automated remediation workflows, turning operational intelligence into action. Today, that vision has expanded. Integrations have matured, authentication has evolved, and new automation paths now let you go beyond “alerting” toward closed-loop, intelligent remediation—where Red Hat Lightspeed findings can directly trigger actions across your automation and observability stack. This post explores what’s new in 2025, including token-based authentication, updated integrations, Event-Driven Ansible, and the new Model Context Protocol (MCP) server, and how these security-focused capabilities help you connect insight to action. The Red Hat Lightspeed team has modernized its API authentication model to support service account–based, token-driven access , marking a major step forward in both security and automation flexibility. Previously, API integrations relied on user credentials and basic authentication. While functional at the time, this approach made it difficult to automate at scale or enforce consistent access controls across multiple systems. Basic authentication has since been deprecated and is no longer supported, reinforcing a shift toward more security-focused, scalable, token-based access.</description></item><item><title>More than meets the eye: Behind the scenes of Red Hat Enterprise Linux 10 (Part 3)</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-11-20-more-than-meets-the-eye-behind-the-scenes-of-red-hat-enterprise-linux-10-part-3/</link><pubDate>Thu, 20 Nov 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-11-20-more-than-meets-the-eye-behind-the-scenes-of-red-hat-enterprise-linux-10-part-3/</guid><description>More than meets the eye: Behind the scenes of Red Hat Enterprise Linux 10 (Part 3) 2023 (18 months until Summit 2025) 2024 (12 months until Summit 2025) More like this Alliander modernises its electricity grid with Red Hat for long-term reliability in balance with rapid innovation Ping command basics for testing and troubleshooting OS Wars_part 1 | Command Line Heroes OS Wars_part 2: Rise of Linux | Command Line Heroes Browse by channel Automation Artificial intelligence Open hybrid cloud Security Edge computing Infrastructure Applications Virtualization Share This series takes a look at the people and planning that went into building and releasing Red Hat Enterprise Linux 10. From the earliest conceptual stages to the launch at Red Hat Summit 2025, we’ll hear firsthand accounts of how RHEL 10 came into being. Part 1 | Part 2 In our previous installment of the story of how Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) 10 came to be, we learned about a new approach to building the platform. In part 3, the team focuses on the delicate balancing act of keeping thousands of moving parts in sync while features like image mode and RHEL Lightspeed (and the stories we’ll tell about them) start to take shape. Mike McGrath, vice president, Core Platforms Engineering This is when things really start to kick into overdrive. The big thing that we watch for internally is what we call the compose. The compose is basically a nightly—or roughly, it could be a few times a day—build of the latest and greatest in RHEL. That’s what I always look to to see how things are going. Major Hayden, senior principal software engineer It’s kind of like a Jenga tower where all the pieces are slightly different sizes. And so you may look at it and say, ‘Well, my piece is really small. You can poke this thing out and nothing will fall. ’ And everyone around you is saying, ‘I believe you, but we’re going to have to check.</description></item><item><title>Why is OpenShift Virtualization becoming the strategic platform for virtualization customers?</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-11-20-why-is-openshift-virtualization-becoming-the-strategic-platform-for-virtualizati/</link><pubDate>Thu, 20 Nov 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-11-20-why-is-openshift-virtualization-becoming-the-strategic-platform-for-virtualizati/</guid><description>Why is OpenShift Virtualization becoming the strategic platform for virtualization customers?

Although this shift created some initial panic, most customers have taken advantage of this shift as an opportunity to make a more strategic decision on where they want to go on their virtualization journey. Red Hat OpenShift Virtualization is built on innovation, where customer needs inspire our engineers to deliver high-impact solutions to help them move from concept to general availability in a matter of months, not years. It’s no surprise that this commitment to rapid, customer-focused innovation earned OpenShift Virtualization the 2025 CRN Innovator Award for the launch of Red Hat OpenShift Virtualization Engine , a virtualization-only edition for Red Hat OpenShift. The engineering team velocity is one of the core reasons OpenShift Virtualization has become a trusted platform for many of the top enterprises across the world. Customer feedback backs the confidence in our platform, with one customer calling out that the product enhancements they had asked for at the beginning of a proof of concept (POC) were actually delivered by the time the POC was finishing. To us, that’s trusted, enterprise-ready innovation! Beyond comprehensive engineering skills, this velocity requires 2 more things: A profound understanding of the space and customer goals , which we provide through our engineers meeting with customers, getting real time feedback on platform capabilities, and together, shaping the outcomes for a given project. Mature technologies and knowing how to harness them into a cloud-native solution , driven by our nearly 2 decades of KVM virtualization experience and many years of Kubernetes expertise. Combined, our engineering teams are capable of reimagining a virtualization suite which augments and complements Kubernetes at every technology and stack layer. Additionally, combining Red Hat OpenShift and Red Hat Ansible Automation Platform can increase customers’ overall level of automation. OpenShift features like GitOps help automate the infrastructure management of adding nodes and maintenance of the infrastructure. Ansible Automation Platform collections automate Day 2 VM operations such as patch management.</description></item><item><title>Kubernetes v1.35.0-beta.0</title><link>https://kubermates.org/releases/2025-11-19-kubernetes-v1-35-0-beta-0/</link><pubDate>Wed, 19 Nov 2025 20:32:24 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/releases/2025-11-19-kubernetes-v1-35-0-beta-0/</guid><description>See kubernetes-announce@.

Even after the spin-out of VMware’s End User Computing (EUC) business group into Omnissa , the fundamentals of this combined solution remain intact. However, the release of VCF 9.0 deserves revisiting those fundamentals to expose how the platform holds up. VCF 9.0 consolidates the private-cloud substrate (vSphere, vSAN, NSX) with cloud automation (VCF Automation), integrated Kubernetes (VMware vSphere Kubernetes Service / VKS) and other advanced services for VCF such as VMware Private AI Services and VMware Data Services Manager (DSM). These innovations, among many others, benefit the Omnissa Horizon VDI solution by providing an intrinsically secure, optimized and scalable foundation for the most demanding virtual desktops. Running Horizon on VCF 9.0 allows customers to benefit from the full set of services of a unified private cloud platform. VCF delivers workload domains, orchestrated upgrades, VPC-based network isolation, and a modern consumption API. It’s a platform that treats desktops as first-class workloads. Security is where VCF immediately shines. Use NSX firewall to wrap a least-privilege policy around Horizon Connection Servers, UAGs, and desktop pools without hair-pinning traffic into external firewalls. VCF 9.0’s VPC constructs enable stamping out a repeatable network perimeter for each Horizon function: Edge (UAG) Brokering (Connection Servers) Desktops Shared services These protections scale with the fleet instead of complicating it. VCF 9.0 also introduces a suite of integrated security and compliance features critical for VDI environments: Centralized network policy management with NSX bolster lateral traffic protection for sensitive VDI desktops, aligning with stringent compliance frameworks.</description></item><item><title>VCF Breakroom Chats Episode 73 –  Next-Gen Data Services: The DBaaS Revolution with VCF 9</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-11-19-vcf-breakroom-chats-episode-73-next-gen-data-services-the-dbaas-revolution-with-/</link><pubDate>Wed, 19 Nov 2025 13:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-11-19-vcf-breakroom-chats-episode-73-next-gen-data-services-the-dbaas-revolution-with-/</guid><description>VCF Breakroom Chats Episode 73 About the VCF Breakroom Chat Series Discover more from VMware Cloud Foundation (VCF) Blog Related Articles Upgrading VMware Cloud Foundation 5.2 to 9.0: Webinar Takeaways Operationalizing the Edge with VMware Cloud Foundation VMware Cloud Foundation is the Gold Standard for Virtual Desktop Infrastructure Welcome to the next episode of the VCF Breakroom Chats.

The key highlight of this release was the unification of all the major components into a single deliverable package to deliver simple, extensible, and consistent automation experience across the stack. Currently, the following VCF components are included as a part of the unified VCF SDK and rest of the components will be made available very soon- VMware vSphere VMware vSAN VMware vSAN Data Protection VMware SDDC Manager If you are reading the term Unified VCF SDK for the first time, do not worry about it. You can visit some of the existing content such as the announcement blog post or visit the VMware Explore Las Vegas 2025 session to get yourself up to speed with all the enhancements introduced with VCF APIs and the VCF SDK. In this blog post I will focus on a small yet very effective enhancement to our vSphere API authentication and explain its usage across the vSphere and vSAN APIs. For context, VMware vSphere exposes two major categories of APIs: vSphere Web Services APIs and vSphere Automation APIs. The primary difference between the two lies in their underlying communication protocol. vSphere Web Services APIs use the Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP) protocol. vSphere Automation APIs use Representational State Transfer (REST). If you have ever explored the Managed Object Browser (MOB) from the vSphere Client, you were interacting with the Web Services (SOAP) APIs. In contrast, the API Explorer in the Developer Center exposes the vSphere Automation (REST) APIs. For building complete solutions, developers often need to work with both sets of APIs.</description></item><item><title>Forging the open path: How Red Hat engineering is adopting AI and what it means for open source</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-11-19-forging-the-open-path-how-red-hat-engineering-is-adopting-ai-and-what-it-means-f/</link><pubDate>Wed, 19 Nov 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-11-19-forging-the-open-path-how-red-hat-engineering-is-adopting-ai-and-what-it-means-f/</guid><description>Forging the open path: How Red Hat engineering is adopting AI and what it means for open source The &amp;ldquo;why:&amp;rdquo; AI, Red Hat, and the open source imperative The rollout: Choice and productivity The sandbox: Internal experimentation The platform: Running it the Red Hat way The lessons: AI demands better engineering The journey ahead Get started with AI for enterprise: A beginner’s guide About the authors Chris Wright Josh Boyer More like this Red Hat Satellite 6.18: New AI, Management, and Security Capabilities GPU-as-a-Service for AI at scale: Practical strategies with Red Hat OpenShift AI Technically Speaking | Driving healthcare discoveries with AI Technically Speaking | Security for the AI supply chain Keep exploring Browse by channel Automation Artificial intelligence Open hybrid cloud Security Edge computing Infrastructure Applications Virtualization Share Over the past several months, Red Hat has been diving into one of the most significant shifts in our industry: the practical, large-scale adoption of generative AI (gen AI) within a major engineering organization. We are not unique in this journey, but at Red Hat, &amp;ldquo;in the open&amp;rdquo; isn&amp;rsquo;t just a development model—it&amp;rsquo;s our culture. We believe it&amp;rsquo;s important to share what we&amp;rsquo;re doing, what we&amp;rsquo;re learning, and how we see this shaping the future of open source collaboration. To be clear, this isn&amp;rsquo;t a publicity piece about a single, perfect tool or an instant success. It&amp;rsquo;s a story about culture, choice, and how AI—when grounded in solid engineering principles—becomes a powerful accelerator for open source innovation. It&amp;rsquo;s impossible to ignore AI’s hype, but what’s obscured by all that buzz is a fundamental truth—AI is a new layer of the technology stack. It&amp;rsquo;s a capability multiplier, much like compilers, the IDE, and the cloud were before it. For Red Hat, our &amp;ldquo;why&amp;rdquo; is twofold: Internal acceleration : We have thousands of engineers working on millions of lines of code across thousands of upstream projects. The potential for our engineers to augment their work with AI to reduce toil, accelerate problem-solving, and automate mundane tasks is massive. We owe it to our engineers to provide them with the best tools to do their best work. The open source future : More importantly, Red Hat’s mission is to be the defining technology company of the 21st century, and we believe open source is the best way to build technology. If AI remains a proprietary &amp;ldquo;black box&amp;rdquo; world, it runs counter to everything we stand for.</description></item><item><title>What's new in Red Hat OpenShift Virtualization 4.20</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-11-19-what-s-new-in-red-hat-openshift-virtualization-4-20/</link><pubDate>Wed, 19 Nov 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-11-19-what-s-new-in-red-hat-openshift-virtualization-4-20/</guid><description>What&amp;rsquo;s new in Red Hat OpenShift Virtualization 4.20 Hybrid cloud flexibility OpenShift Virtualization on Microsoft Azure Red Hat OpenShift OpenShift Virtualization on Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Two-node OpenShift with arbiter Support for ARM Intuitive installation Upgrades and workload mobility Advancing VM operations Simplified management Supercharge VM migration with storage offloading Learn More Upstream project and community Become a certified specialist 15 reasons to adopt Red Hat OpenShift Virtualization About the authors Peter Lauterbach Courtney Grosch More like this Red Hat OpenShift Virtualization: The strategic platform for virtualization customers Alliander modernises its electricity grid with Red Hat for long-term reliability in balance with rapid innovation Keep exploring Browse by channel Automation Artificial intelligence Open hybrid cloud Security Edge computing Infrastructure Applications Virtualization Share Red Hat OpenShift Virtualization 4.20 is now generally available , helping organizations modernize their virtualization strategy with greater speed and confidence through expanded platform availability, enhanced virtual machine (VM) management, and new capabilities for hybrid cloud infrastructure.

With updates to storage offloading, your organization can efficiently plan and execute your VM migrations with MTV 2.10. Speed is a critical component of a VM migration. Storage offloading is now available in Technology Preview in MTV 2.10. For large-scale migrations, network bandwidth is often a primary bottleneck. Storage offloading eliminates this constraint by leveraging the power of existing storage arrays to manage the data transfer. Instead of pushing data over the network, MTV&amp;rsquo;s plug-in module coordinates with the storage provider to move VM disk data directly over the storage system. This results in significantly faster migrations, reduced downtime, and greater reliability. Learn more about storage offloading. Warm migrations are now supported in Developer Preview: Previously limited to cold migrations (in Technology Preview), MTV 2.10 now supports storage offloading with warm migrations.

Nations are drafting laws to control their digital territories. Enterprises are scrambling to comply, seeking cloud solutions that promise to keep sensitive data safe within jurisdictional lines. In response, hyperscalers have rolled out a red carpet of “sovereign” offerings for Europe — complete with local data centers, EU-resident staff, and billion-dollar investments. But a critical and often deliberately obscured distinction lies at the heart of this new landscape: the difference between data residency and data sovereignty. They are not the same. One is a feature linked to geography; the other is a control mechanism that defines autonomy. Understanding this difference is key to piercing the marketing veil — and recognizing that many so-called “sovereign public clouds” are, in fact, marketing-speak rather than true sovereign cloud compliance. Data Residency Vs. Data Sovereignty: The Core Distinction: Location vs. Customer Control To engage in a meaningful discussion, we must first establish clear definitions for these frequently conflated terms. Data Residency refers exclusively to the physical, geographic location where data is stored.</description></item><item><title>NVMe Memory Tiering Design and Sizing on VMware Cloud Foundation 9 Part 2: Design for Security, Redundancy, and Scalability</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-11-18-nvme-memory-tiering-design-and-sizing-on-vmware-cloud-foundation-9-part-2-design/</link><pubDate>Tue, 18 Nov 2025 12:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-11-18-nvme-memory-tiering-design-and-sizing-on-vmware-cloud-foundation-9-part-2-design/</guid><description>Security Redundancy Scalability Discover more from VMware Cloud Foundation (VCF) Blog Related Articles Mapping VLAN Tags to Virtual Private Cloud Subnets Unified Authentication in VMware Cloud Foundation SDK 9.0: Seamless authentication across vSphere and vSAN APIs NVMe Memory Tiering Design and Sizing on VMware Cloud Foundation 9 Part 2: Design for Security, Redundancy, and Scalability In Part 1 of this series, we explored some of the pre-requisites for NVMe Memory Tiering such as workload assessment, memory activeness percentage, VM profile limitations, software pre-requisites, and compatibility of NVMe devices. In addition, we highlighted the importance of adopting VMware Cloud Foundation (VCF) 9, which could provide a significant cost reduction in memory, better CPU utilization and greater VM consolidation. But before we can fully deploy this solution it is important we design with security, redundancy, and scalability in mind, and that is what this section is all about. Memory security is not necessarily a super popular topic for admins, and this is because memory is volatile. However attackers can leverage memory to store malicious information on non-volatile media to evade detection, but I digress – this is more a forensics topic (which I enjoy). Once power is no longer present the information on DRAM (volatile) disappears within minutes. So, with NVMe Memory Tiering we are moving pages from volatile (DRAM) to non-volatile media (NVMe). In order to address any security concerns with memory pages being stored on NVMe devices, we have come up with a couple of solutions that our customers can easily implement after initial configuration. With this first release of the Memory Tiering feature, encryption is already part of the package, and ready to be implemented out of the box. In fact, you have the option to encrypt at the VM level (per VM) or at the host level (all VMs in the host). By default, this option is not enabled but can easily be added to your configuration within the vCenter UI. For NVMe Memory Tiering encryption we do not require a Key Management System (KMS) or Native Key Provider (NKP), instead, the key will be randomly generated at the kernel level by each host using AES-XTS encryption.</description></item><item><title>Harbor: Your Enterprise-Ready Container Registry for a Modern Private Cloud</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-11-18-harbor-your-enterprise-ready-container-registry-for-a-modern-private-cloud/</link><pubDate>Tue, 18 Nov 2025 09:52:24 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-11-18-harbor-your-enterprise-ready-container-registry-for-a-modern-private-cloud/</guid><description>What is Harbor Container Registry?

In manufacturing and operations, a predictable outcome isn&amp;rsquo;t a nice-to-have; it&amp;rsquo;s the core promise of the industrial system itself. Whether you&amp;rsquo;re managing complex motion control or critical process loops, network communication must be reliable and predictable. Time-sensitive networking (TSN) is the essential evolution of Ethernet that brings determinism and a guaranteed delivery schedule to a standard open industrial network. But here&amp;rsquo;s the reality check for information technology (IT) and operations technology (OT) leaders: TSN is great for the wire and hardware, but it&amp;rsquo;s only as good as the software stack running on the devices at the edge. A jittery operating system can ruin a perfect TSN network before a packet ever leaves the device. Things like hardware interrupts, cache swapping, or even heavy application use (like AI or video management) can significantly impact the OS&amp;rsquo;s ability to build and deliver packets in that crucial, repeatable fashion. At Red Hat, we understand the needs of Industrial and we know how important it is to be at peak performance. So we set up tests to prove it. We recently completed a hands-on technical validation, in collaboration with Intel, to demonstrate how Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) and Red Hat Device Edge deliver the precise, deterministic performance required for industrial TSN. A real-time kernel: A tuned operating system designed to use a deterministic scheduler to ensure critical tasks execute in fixed time bounds.

Today&amp;rsquo;s applications integrate countless components—from open source libraries and container images to AI models and training datasets. Each element represents a potential security risk that organizations must understand, verify, and continuously monitor. As supply chain attacks increase in frequency and sophistication, enterprises need comprehensive solutions that provide both artifact integrity and deep visibility into their software dependencies. Red Hat&amp;rsquo;s latest releases of Red Hat Trusted Artifact Signer 1.3 and Red Hat Trusted Profile Analyzer 2.2 deliver a powerful combination of cryptographic signing capabilities and advanced supply chain analysis, addressing a full spectrum of modern software security challenges, including the emerging complexities of AI-powered applications. Modern applications are built from diverse components that create an intricate web of dependencies. Traditional software includes operating system (OS) packages, application libraries, and container base images. But today&amp;rsquo;s AI-powered applications introduce additional complexity with machine learning (ML) models, training datasets, and inference frameworks—each requiring specialized security considerations. This complexity creates multiple attack vectors. Malicious actors can compromise software at build time by injecting code into repositories, at distribution time by replacing legitimate packages with malicious versions, or at deployment time by exploiting weak verification processes. The 2025 supply chain attack on popular npm packages demonstrated that a single compromised component can affect thousands of downstream organizations. Trusted Artifact Signer 1.3 helps to address these challenges by providing enterprise-grade cryptographic signing and verification for all software artifacts.</description></item><item><title>Listening, learning, and leading: How customer feedback shapes the future of Red Hat Learning Subscription</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-11-13-listening-learning-and-leading-how-customer-feedback-shapes-the-future-of-red-ha/</link><pubDate>Thu, 13 Nov 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-11-13-listening-learning-and-leading-how-customer-feedback-shapes-the-future-of-red-ha/</guid><description>Listening, learning, and leading: How customer feedback shapes the future of Red Hat Learning Subscription Key takeaways What is next for Red Hat Learning Subscription?

Our efforts to ensure that you&amp;rsquo;re ready to make the switch, and to prepare your organization for &amp;ldquo;Q-Day&amp;rdquo;, now start with RHEL 9.7. By getting started now, you can proactively begin strengthening your security posture and preparing for a seamless transition to RHEL 10. RHEL 9 was released in 2022 and was an important step forward from a security perspective. It was the first version of RHEL that received FIPS 140-3 certification, matching current security requirements. However, a lot has happened since 2022. Security requirements have changed, and the era of post-quantum cryptography has arrived. For the sake of performance and stability, these new cryptographic algorithms can&amp;rsquo;t be backported to earlier versions of most software the way many organizations have come to expect. Upgrading software today to bring continued stability, functionality, and protection in the post-quantum era is a must, and RHEL 9.7 can be your first step. RHEL 9.7 is a crucial stepping stone for your post-quantum transition. It gives you the opportunity to gain practical experience with post-quantum cryptography, and to understand its implications for your specific workloads. You can also identify any necessary application or infrastructure adjustments before you undertake a full upgrade to RHEL 10, which offers the most comprehensive post-quantum cryptography implementation. A sudden, forced transition to post-quantum cryptography when quantum threats become imminent (Q-Day, currently estimated at 2030) could disrupt your business&amp;rsquo;s operations.</description></item><item><title>Stop fighting with Ingress: NGINX Gateway Fabric is now certified for Red Hat OpenShift</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-11-12-stop-fighting-with-ingress-nginx-gateway-fabric-is-now-certified-for-red-hat-ope/</link><pubDate>Wed, 12 Nov 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-11-12-stop-fighting-with-ingress-nginx-gateway-fabric-is-now-certified-for-red-hat-ope/</guid><description>Stop fighting with Ingress: NGINX Gateway Fabric is now certified for Red Hat OpenShift Beyond Ingress: How the Gateway API and NGINX change the game A shared model for speed and control Unify your application and AI traffic Get it in the catalog Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform | Product Trial About the author Shane Heroux More like this Blog post Blog post Original podcast Original podcast Keep exploring Browse by channel Automation Artificial intelligence Open hybrid cloud Security Edge computing Infrastructure Applications Virtualization Share Platform engineering teams know the drill.

Today I can announce that it&amp;rsquo;s on the way. As part of the RHEL 10.1 update, an offline, locally available command-line assistant is officially in developer preview. For customers with a Red Hat Satellite subscription, it offers AI-powered RHEL guidance based on decades of enterprise Linux experience. Companies and agencies in finance, government, defense, industrial control, and other heightened-security industries will find it particularly useful. A key advantage of this design is its ability to function in completely disconnected, offline, or air-gapped environments, eliminating the need for external network connectivity. This allows users to receive AI-powered guidance and suggestions for a wide range of Red Hat Enterprise Linux tasks, including questions related to the RHEL installation process, troubleshooting, and more, without compromising security or relying on cloud-based services. Access to the offline, locally available command-line assistant requires a Red Hat Satellite subscription. The RHEL command-line assistant gets another improvement in RHEL 10.1 (and RHEL 9.7, also launching today): an increase in its context limit, from 2KB to 32KB. Expanding the command-line assistant&amp;rsquo;s working memory unlocks more powerful, elaborate interactions. Now it can take on larger log files, pipe extensive data streams, and help with bigger tasks. Recent RHEL updates have focused squarely on making it easier for customers to embrace AI. With RHEL 10.1, we&amp;rsquo;re improving a key aspect of the interaction between the operating system and the hardware that supplies the raw computing power AI demands.</description></item><item><title>Your complete guide for getting started with Red Hat OpenShift Virtualization</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-11-12-your-complete-guide-for-getting-started-with-red-hat-openshift-virtualization/</link><pubDate>Wed, 12 Nov 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-11-12-your-complete-guide-for-getting-started-with-red-hat-openshift-virtualization/</guid><description>Your complete guide for getting started with Red Hat OpenShift Virtualization Phase 1: Exploration and foundational training Dive in (no cost) Building foundational expertise (associated costs) Phase 2: Real-world application, mentored implementation and day-2 ops Ready to dive deeper?

For IT leaders and enterprise architects, the challenge isn’t just about keeping up—it’s about making strategic, forward-looking decisions while continuing to leverage existing technology investments. In a new paper “ Future-Proofing IT Infrastructure: A Decision Framework for Enterprise Architects ” HyperFRAME Research provides a structured rubric grounded in operational reality to guide this crucial evolution. The framework outlines eight pragmatic steps for infrastructure modernization: Inventory the Current Infrastructure: A successful modernization effort begins by establishing a clear baseline-—a complete picture of existing workloads, deployment patterns, and supporting platforms. This avoids the risk of investing in the wrong solutions. Evaluate Organizational Structure and Team Skillsets: Technology is only as good as the people and processes that support it. Organizations need to rigorously assess their team’s skills and knowledge gaps, and the cost and time required to bridge them. Determine Non-Functional Requirements (NFRs): While functional requirements define what a system does, NFRs—such as performance, scalability, and resilience—dictate how it operates under pressure. Evaluating infrastructure choices with NFRs in mind is essential for ensuring systems can meet business demands. Compare Virtualization and Containerization Options: With a clear understanding of the current environment, team capabilities, and business needs, organizations can determine which compute model best aligns with workload demands and long-term objectives. Evaluate Platform Capabilities and Integration: The enterprise IT environment is complex, with a myriad of individual infrastructure components. Managing it effectively requires a platform that orchestrates these different components into a cohesive, integrated whole, delivering simplicity with agility and flexibility.</description></item><item><title>Infrastructure Boundaries, Controls, and Policies with VMware Cloud Foundation 9.0</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-11-11-infrastructure-boundaries-controls-and-policies-with-vmware-cloud-foundation-9-0/</link><pubDate>Tue, 11 Nov 2025 19:54:21 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-11-11-infrastructure-boundaries-controls-and-policies-with-vmware-cloud-foundation-9-0/</guid><description>Diving Deeper into Self Service VCF Boundaries VCF Policies VCF Automation Policies Discover more from VMware Cloud Foundation (VCF) Blog Related Articles A Decision Framework for Future-Proofing IT Infrastructure Infrastructure Boundaries, Controls, and Policies with VMware Cloud Foundation 9.0 Analyst Insight Series: Virtualization virtue #3: Supporting application modernization As a Solutions Architect here at Broadcom who talks to our customer engineers on the daily, the biggest feedback I get about VMware Cloud Foundation (VCF) 9.0 is a fear (we’ll call it) about having less control with a self service model: “If you want something done right, you have to do it yourself. ” First of all, you will be doing it yourself through the enforcement of boundaries and policies at the onset. You don’t lose control : it is just front-loaded and implemented by applying the policies and boundaries at provisioning. With this approach you actually have more control with less administrative overhead. Second of all, if you are an infrastructure engineer, you are part of “ self” in “ self service” : in a cloud operating model, you will create infrastructure resources the same way everyone else does: using VCF Automation and Operations where your boundaries and restrictions are imposed in a standard and uniform way. Before we dive in, I would be remiss if I didn’t at least mention that VMware infrastructure as a private cloud is not new. Most of the components mentioned below have been around for more than a decade, and they are in the driver’s seat with VCF. If you are a cloud engineer of any sort, you will find yourself right at home with VCF: that’s the whole point. I have talked about this before , albeit indirectly, but like it or not, you provide infrastructure as a service to the people who consume your infrastructure. When you provision a VM, for example, you are providing a virtual machine and everything that goes with it. If it takes days or weeks for that VM to work its way through approvals, or it’s delayed because “we’re waiting on Derek to get back from vacation,” then you’ve already lost. VCF 9.0 provides a cloud native self service model which gives you more control and more security with less effort.</description></item><item><title>VMware Cloud Foundation 9: Now Ready For All Storage</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-11-11-vmware-cloud-foundation-9-now-ready-for-all-storage/</link><pubDate>Tue, 11 Nov 2025 19:12:46 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-11-11-vmware-cloud-foundation-9-now-ready-for-all-storage/</guid><description>VCF 9 is Ready for All vSphere-supported External Storage What about iSCSI, NFS v4.1, and NVMe over Fabrics?

Customers must weigh the benefits of each storage option based on their specific needs and existing investments to optimize their vSphere environments. Customers looking to rapidly adopt VCF 9 have asked for workflows to support all existing supported vSphere storage types, so in our latest version, Broadcom has significantly expanded storage options, now allowing the use of NFSv3 or Fibre Channel VMFS datastores as principal storage for the management workload domain during greenfield deployments. This enhancement builds upon the robust, automated VMware vSAN deployment capabilities already in place. VMware Cloud Foundation (VCF) 9 supports a variety of storage types as principal storage (see Storage Models in the product documentation for more details). Typically, principal storage is configured during creation of the management or workload domains or when adding new clusters to an existing workload domain. These scenarios are referred to as greenfield deployments. Additional principal storage types such as iSCSI, NFS v4.1, and NVMe over Fabrics (FC or TCP), which are not currently available in a greenfield deployment, can now be configured as principal storage for VCF 9 by converging an existing vSphere environment or by using VCF import. If the default cluster includes multiple datastore types, VCF determines the primary datastore using the following priority: vSAN NFS v3 VMFS NFS 4.1 iSCSI This process is documented in KB 416270​​. This is also detailed in the techdocs under converging an existing vSphere environment into a VCF instance. Specifically “Any supported vSphere storage type” is supported. For a list of supported vSphere 9 supported storage platforms see the Broadcom compatibility guide.</description></item><item><title>Ingress NGINX Retirement: What You Need to Know</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-11-11-ingress-nginx-retirement-what-you-need-to-know/</link><pubDate>Tue, 11 Nov 2025 10:30:00 -0800</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-11-11-ingress-nginx-retirement-what-you-need-to-know/</guid><description>Ingress NGINX Retirement: What You Need to Know About Ingress NGINX History and Challenges Current State and Next Steps To prioritize the safety and security of the ecosystem, Kubernetes SIG Network and the Security Response Committee are announcing the upcoming retirement of Ingress NGINX.

The road ahead Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform | Product Trial About the author JP Jung More like this Blog post Blog post Original podcast Original podcast Keep exploring Browse by channel Automation Artificial intelligence Open hybrid cloud Security Edge computing Infrastructure Applications Virtualization Share The age of quantum computing is on the horizon, and with its immense processing power comes a significant threat to the cryptographic foundations of our digital world. In this article, we&amp;rsquo;ll explore the emerging support for post-quantum cryptography (PQC) in Red Hat OpenShift 4.20 , focusing on how it enhances the core components of the Kubernetes control plane: the apiserver, kubelet, scheduler, and controller-manager. Missing is etcd, using an older version of Go. Today&amp;rsquo;s widely used public-key cryptosystems, such as RSA and elliptic curve cryptography (ECC), form the foundation of security-enhanced online communication. These systems are vulnerable to attacks from large-scale quantum computers, however, which can solve the mathematical problems underlying these algorithms with alarming speed. This has given rise to attacks in which adversaries record encrypted traffic today to decrypt it in the future once they have access to a powerful quantum computer. The same challenge applies to data at rest if an adversary manages to make a copy now to decrypt later. To counter this threat, the field of PQC has emerged, developing new cryptographic algorithms that are resistant to attacks from both classical and quantum computers. Red Hat OpenShift is a Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) certified distribution of Kubernetes, and Kubernetes is written in the Go programming language. Thus, the journey to PQC support in OpenShift begins with Go. The Go 1.24 release marked a significant milestone by introducing support for the X25519MLKEM768 hybrid key exchange mechanism. X25519MLKEM768 is a hybrid key exchange that combines classical X25519 (elliptic curve Diffie-Hellman) with ML-KEM-768 (the post-quantum algorithm).</description></item><item><title>Bringing intelligent, efficient routing to open source AI with vLLM Semantic Router</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-11-11-bringing-intelligent-efficient-routing-to-open-source-ai-with-vllm-semantic-rout/</link><pubDate>Tue, 11 Nov 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-11-11-bringing-intelligent-efficient-routing-to-open-source-ai-with-vllm-semantic-rout/</guid><description>Bringing intelligent, efficient routing to open source AI with vLLM Semantic Router What is vLLM Semantic Router? vLLM Semantic Router and llm-d Enterprise and community value About the author Huamin Chen More like this Blog post Blog post Original podcast Original podcast Browse by channel Automation Artificial intelligence Open hybrid cloud Security Edge computing Infrastructure Applications Virtualization Share The speed of innovation in large language models (LLMs) is astounding, but as enterprises move these models into production, the conversation shifts - it’s no longer just about raw scale; it’s about per-token efficiency and smart, targeted compute use. Simply put, not all prompts require the same level of reasoning. If a user has a simple request, like, &amp;ldquo;What is the capital of North Carolina?&amp;rdquo; a multi-step reasoning process required for say, a financial projection, isn’t necessary. If organizations use heavyweight reasoning models for every request, the result is both costly and inefficient. This dilemma is what we call the challenge of implementing reasoning budgets, and it’s why Red Hat developed vLLM Semantic Router, an open source project that intelligently selects the best model for each task, optimizing cost and efficiency while maximizing ease of use. vLLM Semantic Router is an open source system that acts as an intelligent, cost-aware request routing layer for the highly efficient vLLM inference engine. Think of it as the decision-maker for your LLM inference pipeline - it addresses efficiency challenges through dynamic, semantic-aware routing by: Utilizing a lightweight classifier, like ModernBERT or other pre-trained models, to analyze the query’s intent and complexity. Routing simple queries to a smaller, faster LLM or a non-reasoning model to save compute resources. Directing complex requests requiring deep analysis to more powerful, reasoning-enabled models. vLLM Semantic Router’s purpose is to ensure every token generated adds value. Written in Rust and using Hugging Face’s Candle framework, the router delivers low latency and high concurrency and is engineered for high performance.

Unified data services at the edge Cost efficiency and resilience for the open hybrid cloud Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform | Product Trial About the authors Paul Lancaster Daniel Froehlich Andy Gower (Pure Storage) More like this Blog post Blog post Original podcast Original podcast Keep exploring Browse by channel Automation Artificial intelligence Open hybrid cloud Security Edge computing Infrastructure Applications Virtualization Share The demand to extend applications to the edge has never been greater. From retail shops to industrial and manufacturing sites, there&amp;rsquo;s a need to create, consume, and store data at the edge. Deploying applications at the edge comes with a set of physical constraints, but also with the need to deliver a truly cost-efficient and resilient architecture. When building applications at the edge, you must consider the needs of the individual site as well as the cost to deploy, manage, and maintain applications across multiple edge locations. The good news is that Red Hat OpenShift is evolving to meet this demand head-on. With the introduction of the two-node OpenShift with arbiter topology , Red Hat and partners like Portworx by Pure Storage are delivering a cost-efficient and resilient architecture designed specifically for the edge. The primary motivation behind the two-node OpenShift with arbiter (TNA) initiative is simple: Cost for large-scale edge deployments. For mission-critical edge sites, high availability is non-negotiable. Should a node fail, applications must continue running without disruption, which is why the control plane requires a quorum (typically three or more nodes) to prevent split-brain scenarios and maintain consistency (a principle known as the CAP theorem). Two-node OpenShift with arbiter, now generally available (GA) with OpenShift 4.20, solves this by dramatically reducing the hardware footprint while preserving three-node consistency and availability. Two-node OpenShift with arbiter architecture is a specialized, cost-sensitive solution that is technically a three-node cluster.</description></item><item><title>KServe joins CNCF as an incubating project</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-11-11-kserve-joins-cncf-as-an-incubating-project/</link><pubDate>Tue, 11 Nov 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-11-11-kserve-joins-cncf-as-an-incubating-project/</guid><description>KServe joins CNCF as an incubating project The critical engine behind Red Hat OpenShift AI Unlocking enterprise AI value Join the Movement!

Most organizations are running in both worlds: they have modern, cloud-native applications in containers, and critical, often mission-critical, systems in virtual machines (VMs). The reality is that running two separate virtualization stacks creates silos, complexity, and unnecessary operational cost – what can be called the complexity tax. It slows down your operations and application teams, strains budgets, and ultimately makes it harder to deliver value to the business. We recently spoke with leaders who decided to tackle this fragmentation head-on: Sandeep Kulkarni from Ford Motor Co. and Ali Rey from Emirates NBD. They shared their journey of unifying VMs and containers on one cohesive platform. Their story offers a clear, straightforward playbook for any IT leader facing a similar challenge. Both Ford and Emirates NBD are giants in their respective industries, but they faced the same fundamental challenge: not every application needs to be modernized but they can be future-proofed with a modern platform. Ford , an iconic, 122-year-old brand, runs thousands of applications. While the company has an aggressive modernization journey underway, many core systems may remain in VMs waiting for the application modernization journey or due to their fundamental architecture, compliance, or legacy vendor support. Emirates NBD , one of the largest banks in the Middle East, operates 24/7.</description></item><item><title>Analyst Insight Series: Virtualization virtue #3: Supporting application modernization</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-11-10-analyst-insight-series-virtualization-virtue-3-supporting-application-modernizat/</link><pubDate>Mon, 10 Nov 2025 14:24:50 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-11-10-analyst-insight-series-virtualization-virtue-3-supporting-application-modernizat/</guid><description>Discover more from VMware Cloud Foundation (VCF) Blog Related Articles From Tickets to Clicks: Driving Real Consumption in Your Self‑Service Private Cloud Analyst Insight Series: Virtualization virtue #3: Supporting application modernization VCF Breakroom Chats Episode 69 - Beyond vRA + NSX: Delivering Cloud-Native Networking with VCF 9 Virtual Private Clouds Guest post by Jean Atelsek, Senior Research Analyst,S&amp;amp;P Global Market Intelligence 451 Research This blog is the third in our series on the benefits and trends of virtualization (read blog#1 and blog#2 here) and a companion to the 451 Research Business Impact Brief “ The virtues of virtualization. ” Application modernization means different things to different people, but its universal goal is to make information technology more responsive to business needs. Virtualization – the ability to run multiple operating systems on a single physical machine – planted the seed for the cloud computing paradigm that underlies most modern software development, and it also represents a critical bridge between legacy environments and the container-based and AI-driven deployments revolutionizing how we interact with IT. What does a modern workload look like? Microservices-based architectures, which put software functionality in small, flexible and portable application containers, are one hallmark of cloud-native deployments. 451 Research expects this market to grow at a 15% CAGR to reach $18 billion by 2029. The boom in AI/ML-based workloads is a significant contributor to this forecast. One big challenge of deploying AI workloads is optimizing usage of the powerful graphics processing units (GPUs) needed to efficiently run them. The latest GPUs from NVIDIA, AMD and Intel have been hard to come by due to high demand, and they are expensive when they do become available, with prices reaching up to $40,000 each. The last thing a company wants after provisioning such pricey silicon is to have it sitting idle in a data center waiting to produce a return on the investment. The versatility of virtual machines (VMs) lets organizations “sweat the assets” of their IT environment no matter how heterogeneous the devices supporting it. Decoupling applications from the underlying hardware makes it possible to run software seamlessly across different machines and operating systems. With modern workloads and larger datasets, precious GPU capacity can be accessed and shared more effectively because GPU functionality can be sliced up and distributed at scale to support a variety of programs.</description></item><item><title>VCF Breakroom Chats Episode 69 – Beyond vRA + NSX: Delivering Cloud-Native Networking with VCF 9 Virtual Private Clouds</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-11-10-vcf-breakroom-chats-episode-69-beyond-vra-nsx-delivering-cloud-native-networking/</link><pubDate>Mon, 10 Nov 2025 13:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-11-10-vcf-breakroom-chats-episode-69-beyond-vra-nsx-delivering-cloud-native-networking/</guid><description>VCF Breakroom Chats Episode 69 About the VCF Breakroom Chat Series Discover more from VMware Cloud Foundation (VCF) Blog Related Articles VCF Breakroom Chats Episode 69 - Beyond vRA + NSX: Delivering Cloud-Native Networking with VCF 9 Virtual Private Clouds SAP HANA and SAP NetWeaver Support for vSphere in VMware Cloud Foundation 9.0 on Intel Xeon 6 CPUs with P-core Systems Scaling VMware Cloud Foundation 9.0 Lab Environments using Holodeck 9.0 Welcome to the next episode of the VCF Breakroom Chats.

Learn how to implement dynamic allocation, multi-tenancy, and effective autoscaling for your AI workloads. For organizations investing heavily in AI, the cost of specialized hardware is a primary concern. GPUs/accelerators are expensive, and if that hardware is unused and sits idle, it leads to significant budget waste, making it more difficult to scale your AI projects. One solution is to adopt GPU-as-a-Service (GPUaaS), an operational model designed to help maximize the return on investment (ROI) of your hardware. Red Hat OpenShift AI is a Kubernetes-based platform that can be used to implement a multi-user GPUaaS solution. While provisioning the hardware is the first step, achieving true GPUaaS requires additional dynamic allocation based on workload demand, so GPUs are more quickly reclaimed to minimize idle time. GPUaaS also necessitates multi-tenancy. This is where advanced queuing tools like Kueue (Kubernetes Elastic Unit Execution) become indispensable. Kueue partitions shared resources and enforces multi-tenancy via quotas, guaranteeing fair, predictable access for multiple teams and projects. Once this governance is in place, the core challenge shifts to creating an autoscaling pipeline for AI workloads. The goal of a GPUaaS platform is to integrate popular AI frameworks and automatically scale resources based on workload demand.</description></item><item><title>Red Hat collaborating with Omnissa to bring Horizon virtual desktops to OpenShift Virtualization</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-11-10-red-hat-collaborating-with-omnissa-to-bring-horizon-virtual-desktops-to-openshif/</link><pubDate>Mon, 10 Nov 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-11-10-red-hat-collaborating-with-omnissa-to-bring-horizon-virtual-desktops-to-openshif/</guid><description>Red Hat collaborating with Omnissa to bring Horizon virtual desktops to OpenShift Virtualization Why this matters Looking ahead Learn more 15 reasons to adopt Red Hat OpenShift Virtualization About the author Simon Seagrave More like this Blog post Blog post Original podcast Original podcast Keep exploring Browse by channel Automation Artificial intelligence Open hybrid cloud Security Edge computing Infrastructure Applications Virtualization Share Choice and flexibility are essential in today&amp;rsquo;s IT environments.

By pooling resources across environments and utilizing advanced orchestration, NVIDIA Run:ai significantly enhances GPU efficiency and workload capacity. We recently announced that enterprises can now deploy NVIDIA Run:ai with the built-in VMware vSphere Kubernetes Services (VKS), a standard capability in VMware Cloud Foundation (VCF). This will help enterprises achieve optimum GPU utilization with NVIDIA Run:ai, streamlining Kubernetes deployment, and supporting both container and VM deployments on VCF. This allows for the deployment of AI and traditional workloads on a single platform This blog explores how Broadcom customers can now deploy NVIDIA Run:ai on VCF leveraging VMware Private AI Foundation with NVIDIA to deploy AI Kubernetes clusters to maximize GPU utilization, streamline operations, and unlock GenAI on their private data. While many organizations default to running Kubernetes on bare-metal servers, this “do-it-yourself” approach often results in siloed islands of infrastructure. It forces IT teams to manually build and manage the very services that VCF provides by design, lacking the deep integration, automated lifecycle management, and resilient abstractions for compute, storage, and networking that are critical for production AI. This is where the VMware Cloud Foundation platform provides a decisive advantage. vSphere Kubernetes Service is the Best Way to Deploy Run:ai on VCF The most effective and integrated way to deploy NVIDIA Run:ai on VCF is by using VKS, which provides enterprise-ready, Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) certified Kubernetes clusters that are fully managed and automated. NVIDIA Run:ai is then deployed onto these VKS clusters, creating a unified, secure, and resilient platform from the hardware up to the AI application. The value is not just in running Kubernetes, but in running it on a platform that solves foundational enterprise challenges: Lower TCO through VCF: Reduce infrastructure silos, leverage existing tools and skill set without retraining and changing processes, and provide unified lifecycle management across infrastructure components.</description></item><item><title>VMware Cloud Foundation Automation – All Apps Organization Configurations</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-11-07-vmware-cloud-foundation-automation-all-apps-organization-configurations/</link><pubDate>Fri, 07 Nov 2025 16:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-11-07-vmware-cloud-foundation-automation-all-apps-organization-configurations/</guid><description>Summary Discover more from VMware Cloud Foundation (VCF) Blog Related Articles VCF Breakroom Chats Episode 69 - Beyond vRA + NSX: Delivering Cloud-Native Networking with VCF 9 Virtual Private Clouds Scaling VMware Cloud Foundation 9.0 Lab Environments using Holodeck 9.0 VMware Cloud Foundation Automation - All Apps Organization Configurations In today’s private cloud world, enterprise IT is evolving from “build and manually manage everything” to “provide agile, self-service infrastructure to application teams,” while still maintaining governance, security, and cost control. With VMware Cloud Foundation Automation , you have a platform delivered by the provider team (or the internal cloud platform team) that hands off a polished, governed, ready-to-use environment to your organization’s administrators, who then enable application teams. In VCF Automation, an organization is a top-level construct created by the provider administrator to represent a tenant or line of business. Each organization operates within its own secure, isolated boundary, ensuring that users can access only the services and resources assigned to them. Organizations consume capacity and cloud services from a shared resource pool, and then subdivide those resources for their application teams — modeled in VCF Automation as Projects and Namespaces. Within each organization, users are assigned roles that define their access and responsibilities, enabling controlled, governed self-service. Think of it like a modern enterprise campus: the provider team has constructed the building — the power, cooling, network backbone, and secure access points. Now the keys are handed over to the organization administrator to define how the space is used — allocating areas for teams, setting access controls, defining shared services, and ensuring everyone can work efficiently within the infrastructure’s boundaries. The foundation is ready — now it’s time to prepare the workspace where applications and teams will thrive. In this blog, we’re focusing on the moment right after the hand-off: you’re the org admin, the region quota has been allocated, the networking plumbing is in place, and your “All Apps” organization is ready for configuration. Why “All Apps Organization”? Because this organization type is designed to support the broadest range of workloads — from traditional VM-based application stacks to containerized microservices platforms— both of which your application teams expect to consume at speed and with consistency. Your role as the organization admin is to set that up once — defining Projects/Namespaces, configuring networking and consumption boundaries, setting identity providers up and user access, and making sure app teams can hit the ground running — all while protecting the underlying infrastructure.</description></item><item><title>Introducing the Kubeflow SDK: A Pythonic API to Run AI Workloads at Scale</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-11-07-introducing-the-kubeflow-sdk-a-pythonic-api-to-run-ai-workloads-at-scale/</link><pubDate>Fri, 07 Nov 2025 00:00:00 -0600</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-11-07-introducing-the-kubeflow-sdk-a-pythonic-api-to-run-ai-workloads-at-scale/</guid><description>Unified SDK Concept Introducing Kubeflow SDK Role in the Kubeflow Ecosystem Key Features Unified Python Interface Trainer Client Optimizer Client Local Execution Mode Local Process Backend: Fastest Iteration Container Backend: Production-Like Environment Kubernetes Backend: Production Scale What’s Next?

Get Involved ⚡ We want your feedback! Help shape the future of Kubeflow SDK by taking our quick survey. Scaling AI workloads shouldn’t require deep expertise in distributed systems and container orchestration. Whether you are prototyping on local hardware or deploying to a production Kubernetes cluster, you need a unified API that abstracts infrastructure complexity while preserving flexibility. That’s exactly what the Kubeflow Python SDK delivers. As an AI Practitioner, you’ve probably experienced this frustrating journey: you start by prototyping locally, training your model on your laptop. When you need more compute power, you have to rewrite everything for distributed training. You containerize your code, rebuild images for every small change, write Kubernetes YAMLs, wrestle with kubectl, and juggle multiple SDKs — one for training, another for hyperparameter tuning, and yet another for pipelines. Each step demands different tools, APIs, and mental models. All this complexity slows down productivity, drains focus, and ultimately holds back AI innovation. What if there was a better way? The Kubeflow community started the Kubeflow SDK &amp;amp; ML Experience Working Group (WG) in order to address these challenges. You can find more information about this WG on our YouTube playlist. The SDK sits on top of the Kubeflow ecosystem as a unified interface layer.</description></item><item><title>Nirmata and ControlPlane Partner to Secure Kubernetes with AI</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-11-07-nirmata-and-controlplane-partner-to-secure-kubernetes-with-ai/</link><pubDate>Fri, 07 Nov 2025 02:37:57 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-11-07-nirmata-and-controlplane-partner-to-secure-kubernetes-with-ai/</guid><description>Nirmata and ControlPlane Partner to Secure Kubernetes with AI What is the Nirmata AI Platform Engineer Assistant?

Prior to the introduction of BackendTLSPolicy, there was no API specification that allowed encrypted traffic on the hop from Gateway to backend. The BackendTLSPolicy validation configuration requires a hostname. This hostname serves two purposes. It is used as the SNI header when connecting to the backend and for authentication, the certificate presented by the backend must match this hostname, unless subjectAltNames is explicitly specified. BackendTLSPolicy validation hostname subjectAltNames If subjectAltNames (SANs) are specified, the hostname is only used for SNI, and authentication is performed against the SANs instead. If you still need to authenticate against the hostname value in this case, you MUST add it to the subjectAltNames list. subjectAltNames hostname subjectAltNames BackendTLSPolicy validation configuration also requires either caCertificateRefs or wellKnownCACertificates. caCertificateRefs refer to one or more (up to 8) PEM-encoded TLS certificate bundles. If there are no specific certificates to use, then depending on your implementation, you may use wellKnownCACertificates , set to &amp;ldquo;System&amp;rdquo; to tell the Gateway to use an implementation-specific set of trusted CA Certificates.</description></item><item><title>Kubernetes v1.35.0-alpha.3</title><link>https://kubermates.org/releases/2025-11-05-kubernetes-v1-35-0-alpha-3/</link><pubDate>Wed, 05 Nov 2025 17:52:41 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/releases/2025-11-05-kubernetes-v1-35-0-alpha-3/</guid><description>See kubernetes-announce@.

At Broadcom, we are not just consumers of open-source projects, we are active contributors and maintainers helping shape CNCF initiatives. Our engineers help address complex operational challenges through direct upstream contributions that make Kubernetes more reliable, scalable, and secure. Broadcom has long been one of the top five contributors 1 to CNCF projects, demonstrating not just participation but genuine leadership in the open-source ecosystem. This isn’t about using open source simply as a consumer but rather strengthening it as a shared foundation for innovation, a practice we uphold across all projects shown in Figure 1. Broadcom’s sustained investment and contributions reflect deep trust in community-driven progress, where collaboration and transparency ultimately serve customers, partners, and the broader industry. Figure 1: Fostering Innovation through Collaboration Challenges for customers By 2029, more than 95% of global organizations will be running containerized applications in production, up from less than 50% in 2023 2. Kubernetes has played a key role as the container orchestration system with adoption at 80% according to a survey conducted by CNCF in 2024 3. In the same survey, 46% of the respondents indicated that open-source projects, including Kubernetes itself, are difficult to understand or run while an equal percentage expressed concerns about the longevity of these projects, and 29% of respondents expressed concerns about security vulnerabilities. While Kubernetes is incredibly powerful and a standard for modern infrastructure, it is also inherently complex. Kubernetes requires integration with dozens of separate tools to achieve enterprise-grade security, compliance, lifecycle management, and consistent operations at scale. Customers are responsible for integrating and operating a complex ecosystem securely and consistently.</description></item><item><title>Workload Placement in VMware Cloud Foundation: Smarter VM Deployment for Performance and Efficiency</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-11-05-workload-placement-in-vmware-cloud-foundation-smarter-vm-deployment-for-performa/</link><pubDate>Wed, 05 Nov 2025 13:24:27 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-11-05-workload-placement-in-vmware-cloud-foundation-smarter-vm-deployment-for-performa/</guid><description>Why Workload Placement Matters How It Works: The “Smart Room Planner” Analogy Business and Operational Intent Expressing Intent with Tags A Real-World Example Workload Placement vs. DRS Final Thoughts Discover more from VMware Cloud Foundation (VCF) Blog Related Articles VCF Breakroom Chats Episode 69 - Beyond vRA + NSX: Delivering Cloud-Native Networking with VCF 9 Virtual Private Clouds Scaling VMware Cloud Foundation 9.0 Lab Environments using Holodeck 9.0 VMware Cloud Foundation Automation - All Apps Organization Configurations When deploying virtual machines (VMs), where they land matters — not just for performance, but for efficiency, compliance, and cost. That’s where Workload Placement in VMware Cloud Foundation (VCF) comes in. It finds the ideal cluster or host for each VM by evaluating real-time capacity, performance data, and your organization’s business or operational intent. In short, it helps ensure every workload lands exactly where it should — without the manual guesswork. If you’ve ever had to manually decide where to deploy a new workload, you know how easy it is to create resource hotspots or imbalance within your clusters. Workload Placement eliminates that uncertainty. By continuously analyzing real-time capacity and performance metrics, VCF automatically recommends — or even performs — optimal VM placements. This ensures your workloads meet performance, compliance, and cost objectives while freeing your teams to focus on innovation instead of firefighting. Think of Workload Placement as a smart room planner for your data center. Each VM is a piece of furniture — some large, some small, all with specific needs. The clusters and hosts are rooms with varying space, lighting, and features.</description></item><item><title>From Chat to Control: Why Platform Engineers Need More Than an LLM</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-11-05-from-chat-to-control-why-platform-engineers-need-more-than-an-llm/</link><pubDate>Wed, 05 Nov 2025 08:00:43 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-11-05-from-chat-to-control-why-platform-engineers-need-more-than-an-llm/</guid><description>From Chat to Control: Why Platform Engineers Need More Than an LLM The Productivity Mirage Why LLMs Alone Don’t Deliver Real Platform Productivity No Real Context Short Memory, Long Workflows Blind Confidence Without Validation No Audit, No Trust Operational Reality: Cost, Access, and Real-Time Enforcement From Chat to Control: Enter the Nirmata AI Platform Engineering Assistant How Nirmata Bridges the Gap Built for the Real World — and Regulated Ones Agentic Intelligence, Not Just LLMs The Path Forward Large Language Models (LLMs) like ChatGPT, Claude, and tools like Cursor are transforming how developers write and debug code. They autocomplete YAML, summarize logs, and even generate Kubernetes manifests. But for platform engineers, the mission isn’t just about writing code — it’s about governing, securing, and optimizing the systems that run it. And that’s where today’s LLMs fall short. It’s tempting to believe that adding an LLM to your workflow instantly makes your platform team more productive. But platform engineering requires precision, auditability, and control, not just good guesses. When managing clusters, pipelines, and cloud environments, every action must be traceable, validated, and compliant with security and regulatory standards. General-purpose LLMs weren’t designed for that. Let’s break down why. LLMs understand text — not systems. They don’t have live visibility into your clusters, GitOps pipelines, or policy baselines. So while they can generate YAML or Terraform, they can’t tell if it will actually pass admission control or align with organizational standards.</description></item><item><title>Kubernetes Best Practices in 2025: Scaling, Security, and Cost Optimization</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-11-05-kubernetes-best-practices-in-2025-scaling-security-and-cost-optimization/</link><pubDate>Wed, 05 Nov 2025 07:28:41 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-11-05-kubernetes-best-practices-in-2025-scaling-security-and-cost-optimization/</guid><description>Why Kubernetes Best Practices Matter in 2025 Scaling Kubernetes Applications Efficiently Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA) and Vertical Pod Autoscaler (VPA) Cluster Autoscaler and Resource Quotas Right-Sizing Containers for Performance Using KodeKloud’s Kubernetes Labs to Practice Scaling Securing Your Kubernetes Cluster in 2025 Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) and Secrets Management Implementing Network Policies and Pod Security Standards Supply-Chain Security and Image Scanning Learn Kubernetes Security Hands-On with KodeKloud Labs Kubernetes Cost Optimization Strategies Right-Sizing Clusters and Workloads Leverage Spot Instances and Node Pool Optimization Use Namespaces and Resource Quotas for Cost Control Monitor, Measure, and Reduce Idle Time Practice Kubernetes Cost Optimization with KodeKloud Labs Kubernetes Observability and Performance Tuning Why Observability Is the Foundation of Performance Core Pillars: Metrics, Logs, and Traces Bringing AI into Observability (AIOps) eBPF and OpenTelemetry: Deep Observability for 2025 How KodeKloud Helps You Master Observability Common Kubernetes Mistakes to Avoid in 2025 1.

Centralized visibility and insights Reduce Argo CD resource usage Best of both topologies Integration with Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management The road ahead Getting started Red Hat Ansible Automation Platform | Product Trial About the authors Harriet Lawrence Gerald Nunn Jann Fischer More like this Blog post Blog post Keep exploring Browse by channel Automation Artificial intelligence Open hybrid cloud Security Edge computing Infrastructure Applications Virtualization Share Running a single instance of Argo CD on a single cluster used to be common, but now a multi-cluster GitOps architecture has become the norm. This way of working does come with its own set of challenges. Typically organizations have had to make compromises when deploying Argo CD in varying topologies depending on their specific priorities (for example, management or scalability). But multi-cluster deployments just got easier to manage and secure with the Argo CD Agent in Red Hat OpenShift GitOps. A new addition to the GitOps operator, the agent is part of the Red Hat OpenShift Platform Plus (OPP) subscription. Broadly, there are two common topologies for implementing Argo CD. The first is centralized, in which a single Argo CD instance runs in a management cluster and is responsible for deploying resources across a fleet of OpenShift or Kubernetes clusters. This provides for a single pane of glass which simplifies management, but can become challenging to scale as the number of applications and clusters grow. The other common topology is distributed, in which Argo CD is distributed across the fleet of OpenShift or Kubernetes clusters. This provides increased scalability, but also increases the complexity of provisioning and managing those instances. Scale has become the major blocker for large production implementations. It&amp;rsquo;s not just Argo CD&amp;rsquo;s performance that&amp;rsquo;s important.</description></item><item><title>VCF Breakroom Chats | Episode 70: Simplifying Private Cloud with Fleet Management and Lifecycle Management</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-11-04-vcf-breakroom-chats-episode-70-simplifying-private-cloud-with-fleet-management-a/</link><pubDate>Tue, 04 Nov 2025 15:16:14 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-11-04-vcf-breakroom-chats-episode-70-simplifying-private-cloud-with-fleet-management-a/</guid><description>Discover more from VMware Cloud Foundation (VCF) Blog Related Articles VCF Breakroom Chats Episode 69 - Beyond vRA + NSX: Delivering Cloud-Native Networking with VCF 9 Virtual Private Clouds SAP HANA and SAP NetWeaver Support for vSphere in VMware Cloud Foundation 9.0 on Intel Xeon 6 CPUs with P-core Systems VCF Breakroom Chats | Episode 70: Simplifying Private Cloud with Fleet Management and Lifecycle Management Are you looking to improve consistency, eliminate manual upgrade processes, and reduce maintenance downtime to help scale your private cloud deployment?

Although this feature is available at the compute component of VCF (vSphere), we refer to it in the context of VCF given the deep integration with other components such as VCF Operations, which we will refer to in later blogs. Memory Tiering is a new feature included with VMware Cloud Foundation and was one of the main topics of conversation for most of my sessions at VMware Explore 2025. I saw a lot of interest, and a lot of great questions came from our customers on adoption, use cases, etc. This is a multi-part blog series where I intend to help answer a lot of the common questions coming from our customers, partners, and internal staff. For a high level understanding of what Memory Tiering is, please refer to this blog. Before enabling Memory Tiering, a thorough assessment of your environment is crucial. Start by evaluating workloads in your datacenter and pay special attention to memory. One of the key measures we will look at is the active memory of the workload. For workloads to be an optimal candidate for Memory Tiering, we want the total active memory to be 50% or less of the DRAM capacity. Why 50% you ask? Well, the default configuration of Memory Tiering is to provide you with 100% more memory or 2x your memory. So, after enabling Memory Tiering, half of the memory will be coming from DRAM (Tier 0) and the other half comes from NVMe (Tier 1).</description></item><item><title>vSAN Data Protection in VMware Cloud Foundation – The Solution You Already Own</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-11-04-vsan-data-protection-in-vmware-cloud-foundation-the-solution-you-already-own/</link><pubDate>Tue, 04 Nov 2025 13:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-11-04-vsan-data-protection-in-vmware-cloud-foundation-the-solution-you-already-own/</guid><description>Local Protection the Easy Way Simple and Flexible Recovery Fast and Flexible Cloning How to Get Started Install the Virtual Appliance used for vSAN Data Protection Configure Protection Groups Extended Functionality in VCF 9.0 Summary Discover more from VMware Cloud Foundation (VCF) Blog Related Articles Scaling VMware Cloud Foundation 9.0 Lab Environments using Holodeck 9.0 VMware Cloud Foundation Automation - All Apps Organization Configurations Workload Placement in VMware Cloud Foundation: Smarter VM Deployment for Performance and Efficiency With a flurry of announcements and new capabilities offered in VMware Cloud Foundation (VCF) 9.0, it is sometimes easy to overlook relatively new features hidden in plain sight. Protecting data in a private cloud has been a hot topic as of late, extending well beyond just typical data recovery requirements. Customers are looking to devise practical strategies to protect themselves against ransomware attacks and disaster recovery using solutions that are easy to manage at scale. vSAN Data Protection initially debuted in vSAN 8 U3, as a part of VMware Cloud Foundation 5.2. Perhaps the most overlooked aspect of vSAN Data Protection is that it is a part of the VCF license! Why is this so important? If you are running vSAN ESA in your VCF environment, you have everything you need to locally protect your workloads using vSAN Data Protection. It can serve as a terrific way to augment your existing protection strategies or serve as the foundation for more comprehensive protection. Let’s take a brief look at what this local protection can do for you, and how you can adopt it in a simple and scalable way. As a part of your VCF license, vSAN Data Protection gives you the ability to use snapshots the way you always envisioned. Using vSAN ESA’s native snapshotting engine, it allows you to: Easily define groups of VMs and their protection and retention schedules — retaining up to 200 snapshots per VM. Create crash-consistent snapshots of VMs at regular intervals with little to no impact on performance. Easily restore one or more VMs directly in vCenter Server using the vSphere Client, even if they have been removed from inventory. Since vSAN Data Protection protects at the VM level, protecting and restoring discrete VMDKs within a VM is not possible at this time.</description></item><item><title>Leading the Cloud With Curiosity : Spotlight on Pranav Nambiar, SVP, AI/ML &amp; PaaS</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-11-04-leading-the-cloud-with-curiosity-spotlight-on-pranav-nambiar-svp-ai-ml-paas/</link><pubDate>Tue, 04 Nov 2025 04:01:20 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-11-04-leading-the-cloud-with-curiosity-spotlight-on-pranav-nambiar-svp-ai-ml-paas/</guid><description>Leading the Cloud With Curiosity : Spotlight on Pranav Nambiar, SVP, AI/ML &amp;amp; PaaS What made DigitalOcean the right place for you?

While both roles share a focus on automation, reliability, and scalability, their core missions, tools, and metrics for success differ. With the rise of AI-assisted infrastructure management, these roles are converging faster than ever. SREs ensure system reliability, performance, and uptime through automation and incident management. Platform Engineers build self-service, secure, and compliant platforms that empower developers to deploy applications efficiently. SREs focus on maintaining system reliability and meeting SLAs, while Platform Engineers enable developers with secure, reusable, and automated workflows. SREs measure success through uptime and error budgets, while Platform Engineers focus on developer productivity and compliance consistency. SREs rely on Prometheus , Grafana , PagerDuty , and ChaosMesh for observability and incident response. Platform Engineers leverage ArgoCD , Kyverno , Terraform , and Nirmata Control Hub for automation, governance, and Policy-as-Code enforcement. SREs specialize in observability, capacity planning, and performance optimization, while Platform Engineers focus on building Internal Developer Platforms (IDPs), enforcing security policies, and managing infrastructure-as-code. Startups often employ hybrid DevOps or SRE roles.

For decades, OT environments have been built on proprietary, siloed systems, prized for their stability and longevity. But as we see technology power improvements in efficiency, productivity, and cost reduction, the pressure to evolve is immense. It&amp;rsquo;s no longer just about keeping the factory running; it&amp;rsquo;s about making it smarter, more agile, and more resilient. This shift presents a unique challenge for IT managers and business leaders. How do you bring the benefits of modern IT—like automation, security, and data analytics—into a world built on a completely different set of principles, all without disrupting mission-critical operations? As a software company with deep IT roots, Red Hat knew that in order to truly have relevance in this space, we needed to not only bring in experts in the OT space, but also to partner with trusted brands like ABB, Schneider Electric, and more that could provide guidance on how to move into the OT space. Red Hat is focused on helping industries navigate this transformation by providing a more consistent advanced compute platform designed to simplify deployment, maintenance, and operations. Our open source solutions are designed to lower operating costs, accelerate time-to-market, and deliver reliable innovation with greater security capabilities. The answer isn&amp;rsquo;t about replacing everything overnight. It&amp;rsquo;s about building a bridge and this is where a comprehensive, platform-centric approach becomes so powerful. Breaking down silos is key. In my experience, the biggest roadblock isn&amp;rsquo;t the technology itself—it&amp;rsquo;s the historical and necessary distinction between IT and OT.</description></item><item><title>Drift Detection for Kubernetes: The Missing Link in Secure GitOps</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-11-01-drift-detection-for-kubernetes-the-missing-link-in-secure-gitops/</link><pubDate>Sat, 01 Nov 2025 21:50:42 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-11-01-drift-detection-for-kubernetes-the-missing-link-in-secure-gitops/</guid><description>Drift Detection for Kubernetes: The Missing Link in Secure GitOps What is Drift Detection? Implications for Security Why Drift Detection Matters — Even with GitOps Customer Use Case: Detecting Unauthorized RBAC Drift Policy-as-Code to the Rescue Example Policy: Detect Unauthorized Changes to ClusterRoles and ClusterRoleBindings How It Works Testing the Policy Beyond RBAC: Other Drift Detection Possibilities Summary Next Steps Modern Kubernetes environments are meant to be declarative — what you define in Git is what should be running in production. But in reality, things drift. Resources change without review, permissions are updated manually, or configuration baselines diverge. This phenomenon — known as configuration drift — silently erodes the reliability and security of even the most well-engineered platforms. In this post, we’ll explore what drift detection means for Kubernetes, why it’s critical even in GitOps workflows, and how Policy-as-Code can help teams prevent and detect it automatically. Drift detection is the process of identifying when the actual state of a Kubernetes resource deviates from its declared or desired state. Drift can occur in many ways: A user manually edits a resource ( kubectl edit/apply ) outside of GitOps workflows. An automated tool or controller changes a setting unexpectedly. A misconfigured Helm or CI/CD pipeline overwrites values. When drift occurs, your clusters may no longer match compliance, security, or operational expectations — and those changes often go unnoticed until an incident occurs. Uncontrolled drift can create shadow configurations — resources that bypass review and violate security policies. For example: An altered ClusterRole granting unintended privileges.</description></item><item><title>Forrester Opportunity Snapshot: A Single Platform Approach to Managing Containers and VMs</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-10-31-forrester-opportunity-snapshot-a-single-platform-approach-to-managing-containers/</link><pubDate>Fri, 31 Oct 2025 23:27:45 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-10-31-forrester-opportunity-snapshot-a-single-platform-approach-to-managing-containers/</guid><description>Discover more from VMware Cloud Foundation (VCF) Blog Related Articles Forrester Opportunity Snapshot: A Single Platform Approach to Managing Containers and VMs VCF Breakroom Chats Episode 71: Maximizing VCF Resource Prudency through Capacity Management IDC Spotlight: Overcoming Kubernetes Complexity with Modern Private Cloud Today, technology modernization isn’t a choice—it’s a necessity. IT leaders seeking a competitive edge are prioritizing a modern, resilient infrastructure that can support advanced applications and drive innovation. This new focus is squarely on cloud-native ecosystems, with both containers and virtual machines (VMs) seen as core elements of an enterprise modernization strategy. The challenge, as always, lies in managing increasing complexity. Organizations are running more container and VM management solutions than ever before, often facing issues with siloed infrastructure and operational inefficiencies. Broadcom recently commissioned a Forrester Opportunity Snapshot – “ Modernize Or Fall Behind: Rethinking IT Infrastructure For A Competitive Edge ” — that surveyed 216 IT decision-makers from the US, EMEA, and APAC with influence over their organization’s IT infrastructure strategy and architecture. 84% reported they were struggling to oversee the different tools and platforms used to manage their server virtualization and container management solutions. The demand for a simpler approach is clear: 85% of respondents want a single, unified platform to manage both containers and VMs. This unified approach promises significant benefits beyond simplified management. More than 80% of IT decision makers expect a single platform to increase scalability, streamline infrastructure management, and enhance resource utilization. But this isn’t just about central IT; a unified platform also accelerates DevOps processes and boosts application team agility. Read the report to learn how your peers are thinking about how to address the challenges of deploying and managing both containers and VMs, and how a single, unified platform such as VMware Cloud Foundation can help.</description></item><item><title>Top Kubernetes Certifications in 2025: Which One Should You Choose?</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-10-31-top-kubernetes-certifications-in-2025-which-one-should-you-choose/</link><pubDate>Fri, 31 Oct 2025 05:52:44 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-10-31-top-kubernetes-certifications-in-2025-which-one-should-you-choose/</guid><description>Introduction - Why Kubernetes Certifications Matter in 2025 The CNCF and Its Role in Kubernetes Certifications The Value of Getting Kubernetes Certified 1.

This post presents Red Hat’s submissions using the FP8 quantized llama 3.1-8b model with vLLM 0.10.0 on Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) 9.6, outlining our approach to achieving reproducible, high-throughput LLM inference. Our configuration delivered competitive single-GPU performance, achieving 5777 tokens/sec (Offline) and 5103 tokens/sec (Server) on a single H100 GPU, and 1642 tokens/sec (Offline) and 1207 tokens/sec (Server) on a single L40S GPU. In this article, you’ll hear about MLPerf test scenarios, benchmark setup, tuning methodology, and results, and learn how these efforts align with Red Hat’s broader strategy to deliver open, scalable, and production-grade AI inference platforms. The accelerated pace of innovation in large language models (LLMs) and their associated ecosystems has increased widespread adoption across virtually every industry. This momentum is fueled by continual advancements in hardware accelerators, including modern GPUs and custom AI Application-Specific Integrated Circuits (ASICs) that unlock an unprecedented level of parallelism and computational throughput. Complementing these advancements, software-layer innovations are transforming how efficiently these hardware capabilities are harnessed. At the heart of this software evolution are inference engines, which serve as the execution backbone for deploying foundation models. These engines optimize how model weights, activation patterns, and memory flows are mapped to underlying hardware, achieving substantial gains in latency, throughput, and energy efficiency. Modern inference engines dynamically adapt to heterogeneous environments across cloud, edge, and on-premise deployments. They also integrate advanced scheduling, quantization, caching, and compilation techniques to accelerate end-to-end inference pipelines.</description></item><item><title>Friday Five — October 31, 2025</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-10-31-friday-five-october-31-2025/</link><pubDate>Fri, 31 Oct 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-10-31-friday-five-october-31-2025/</guid><description>Friday Five — October 31, 2025 AIM Media House : “Customers want an OpenAI-like service they control,” says Red Hat’s Tushar Katarki Headed to KubeCon?

Joining industry leaders in the strategic move to Red Hat OpenShift Virtualization gives you the best of both worlds: The operational familiarity of a virtual machine (VM) combined with the agility and scalability of a Kubernetes-native platform. You&amp;rsquo;re running critical workloads in a modern, efficient way. But have you stopped to ask the crucial question: &amp;ldquo;How are we protecting them?&amp;rdquo; If your answer involves traditional, hypervisor-level backup tools, you might have a significant gap in your data protection strategy. The simple truth is that a VM running on OpenShift is fundamentally different from one on a legacy hypervisor, and it demands a modern approach to backup and recovery. In a traditional virtualization stack, a VM is a relatively self-contained unit. Backing it up usually meant taking an agent-based or hypervisor-level snapshot of a VMDK or VHDX file on a datastore. Simple enough. But in OpenShift Virtualization, a VM is much more than a virtual disk file. It&amp;rsquo;s a composite application defined by a collection of interdependent Kubernetes resources. This includes the VirtualMachineInstance (VMI) itself, its DataVolumes and PersistentVolumeClaims (PVCs), along with associated ConfigMaps , Secrets , and network services that allow it to function. VirtualMachineInstance DataVolumes PersistentVolumeClaims ConfigMaps Secrets Backing up only the persistent volume is like saving your car&amp;rsquo;s engine but throwing away the chassis, wheels, and control system. You have a critical component, but you can&amp;rsquo;t actually rebuild the car.</description></item><item><title>Build, Deploy, and Scale with Confidence: vSphere Kubernetes Service 3.5 is Now Live with 24-Month Support</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-10-29-build-deploy-and-scale-with-confidence-vsphere-kubernetes-service-3-5-is-now-liv/</link><pubDate>Wed, 29 Oct 2025 16:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-10-29-build-deploy-and-scale-with-confidence-vsphere-kubernetes-service-3-5-is-now-liv/</guid><description>vSphere Kubernetes release(VKr) 1.34 Advanced Cluster Configuration for Kubernetes Components Cluster API v1beta2 for Enhanced Kubernetes Cluster Management Prevent Upgrade Failures Due to Misconfigured PodDisruptionBudget Streamlined Operations: CLI, Add-On Management, and Support Tools Discover more from VMware Cloud Foundation (VCF) Blog Related Articles Build, Deploy, and Scale with Confidence: vSphere Kubernetes Service 3.5 is Now Live with 24-Month Support VCF Breakroom Chats Episode 71: Maximizing VCF Resource Prudency through Capacity Management Government-Ready NVIDIA AI Enterprise Containers Now Available for Customers of VMware Private AI Foundation with NVIDIA VMware vSphere Kubernetes Service (VKS) 3.5 is now generally available and this new release makes 24-month support available to each Kubernetes minor version, starting with VKr 1.34.

Just ask Bradley, a non-traditional student at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and a business analyst intern on the IT Operations Analytics team. Bradley started his career at Red Hat during the summer of 2024, but getting here has been an adventure in itself. We sat down with him to talk about unique career paths, transferable skills, and his experience with Red Hat’s emerging talent program. After graduating high school, Bradley pursued a career in banking instead of following the traditional college route. Over the next 5 years, he worked his way up from a banking associate to a senior role. Bradley was progressing well in his career, but felt like something was missing. “Everything was going pretty well for me,” says Bradley, “to the point that I had the freedom to make a different decision in life, to go do what I always wanted to do. And that was to work in technology in some way or another. ” Bradley began this transition by attending community college at night. “Weirdly enough, the astronomy course I took in community college was the reason I wanted to pursue a higher-level education at UNC,” he reflects. His astronomy professor was passionate about the subject and connected it to students’ daily lives.</description></item><item><title>The State of Missouri Scales Automation, Unlocks Time for Innovation</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-10-29-the-state-of-missouri-scales-automation-unlocks-time-for-innovation/</link><pubDate>Wed, 29 Oct 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-10-29-the-state-of-missouri-scales-automation-unlocks-time-for-innovation/</guid><description>The State of Missouri Scales Automation, Unlocks Time for Innovation More like this Blog post Blog post Original podcast Original podcast Keep exploring Browse by channel Automation Artificial intelligence Open hybrid cloud Security Edge computing Infrastructure Applications Virtualization Share The State of Missouri serves millions of people digitally every year, offering a range of services from motor vehicle registrations and various state licenses to health and social benefits and resident support. These citizen services require significant operational rigor, driven by an IT organization focused on delivering technology with speed, consistency, and efficiency. Before adopting Red Hat Ansible Automation Platform, the State of Missouri’s IT landscape was a mix of disparate IT automation products, leading to a sprawling and disconnected environment and a number of resulting pain points. For the engineering team, it meant dealing with a variety of tools, a lack of standardization, and an inability to easily share and collaborate on work across the organization. Across departments, critical tasks could take hours or even days to complete manually, increasing the risk of human error and delaying the delivery of services. Recognizing that this approach wasn&amp;rsquo;t sustainable, the state adopted Ansible Automation Platform to centralize automation efforts with a dedicated team to support it. As the team began rolling out this platform, certain requirements had to be met. First, the team tackled a widespread concern of how to integrate a sensitive password and certificate management solutions into the new automation. Instead of creating a new process, they built a custom Ansible Content Collection that connects to their existing secrets repository that includes modules and roles to more securely call sensitive data. They approved and stored this new custom collection in their private automation hub instance – allowing them to organize and control recommended automation assets like this for use across the IT organization. With testing complete, they were ready to use it. This readily available custom Ansible Content Collection made a huge impact in their organization, providing other teams with a sense of comfort and overcoming their hesitancy to adopt automation.</description></item><item><title>Remediator Agent for Kubernetes – AI-Powered Policy Remediation</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-10-28-remediator-agent-for-kubernetes-ai-powered-policy-remediation/</link><pubDate>Tue, 28 Oct 2025 22:08:46 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-10-28-remediator-agent-for-kubernetes-ai-powered-policy-remediation/</guid><description>Remediator Agent for Kubernetes – AI-Powered Policy Remediation What Is the Remediator Agent? Why We Built Remediator How The Remediator Agent Works Flexible Deployment Options What Makes the Remediator Agent Different Try Remediator Agent Today Kubernetes gives teams incredible power and flexibility—but it’s also noisy. Every day, platform and security teams encounter a flood of policy violations, including missing resource limits, insecure container settings, deprecated APIs, and more. Fixing them typically means opening a ticket, chasing down the right developer, or manually editing manifests—wasting time and increasing mean time to remediate (MTTR). What if instead of endless firefighting, your system could spot a violation and propose the fix—automatically ? That’s precisely what the Remediator Agent does. The Remediator Agent is an AI-powered remediation engine for Kubernetes that integrates directly with Kyverno and Nirmata Control Hub (NCH). It bridges the gap between policy detection and automated action , helping teams reduce manual work while maintaining their clusters’ compliance and security. With Kyverno and NCH, you already get powerful policy-as-code and cluster-wide visibility into policy violations. But visibility alone doesn’t solve the problem; it just exposes it. Teams kept asking: “Can you just fix this for me?” “Can you open the PR so I don’t have to?” “Can we run this across multiple clusters without breaking GitOps?” The Remediator Agent answers these with AI-assisted remediation that works hand-in-hand with your existing GitOps workflows – and most importantly, helps teams dramatically reduce MTTR. Think of Remediator as the missing link between detection and action: Watch: The agent continuously detects policy violations. Understand: AI interprets the violation, the resource, and the policy intent. Propose: It generates a clean diff, the actual lines to change, and explains why.</description></item><item><title>Government-Ready NVIDIA AI Enterprise Containers Now Available for Customers of VMware Private AI Foundation with NVIDIA</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-10-28-government-ready-nvidia-ai-enterprise-containers-now-available-for-customers-of-/</link><pubDate>Tue, 28 Oct 2025 18:31:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-10-28-government-ready-nvidia-ai-enterprise-containers-now-available-for-customers-of-/</guid><description>Why This Matters What It Enables STIG &amp;amp; FIPS Capabilities in VCF 9.0 STIG Compliance FIPS 140 Support Ready to get started on your AI and ML journey?

Summary Discover more from VMware Cloud Foundation (VCF) Blog Related Articles Government-Ready NVIDIA AI Enterprise Containers Now Available for Customers of VMware Private AI Foundation with NVIDIA Application Versus Infrastructure-Level High Availability with vSAN in VMware Cloud Foundation The FinOps Journey: From Visibility to Business Value Maintaining availability of data and the applications that produce or consume that data might be the most important responsibility of data center administrators. Capabilities like high performance or special data services mean very little if the applications and the data they produce or consume is not readily available. Ensuring availability is a complex topic, as application availability and data availability use different techniques to achieve the desired result. Sometimes availability requirements are achieved using infrastructure-level mechanisms, while others may use application-centric solutions. What is best for your environment depends heavily on the requirements and capabilities of your infrastructure. While VMware Cloud Foundation (VCF) can deliver high levels of data and application availability in a simple way , this post will look at the differences in providing high availability of applications and data using application-level technologies versus inherent infrastructure-level technologies in VCF. We will also look at how VMware Data Services Manager (DSM) can play a part in simplifying some of these decisions. Protecting applications and data require an understanding of what typical failures look like, and what a system can do to accommodate for failure. For example, failures in a physical infrastructure may include: Centralized storage solutions like storage arrays Discrete storage devices in distributed solutions Hosts Network interface cards (NICs) Network switching fabrics, causing partitions Site/zone-level failures Failures like these noted above could impact the data, the applications, or both. Failures come in a variety of ways, with some explicitly identified, while others only through absence. Some failures are temporary, while others permanent. Solutions must be sophisticated enough to automatically handle these failure and recovery scenarios.</description></item><item><title>Red Hat AI: Modular building blocks for scalable, repeatable model customization</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-10-28-red-hat-ai-modular-building-blocks-for-scalable-repeatable-model-customization/</link><pubDate>Tue, 28 Oct 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-10-28-red-hat-ai-modular-building-blocks-for-scalable-repeatable-model-customization/</guid><description>Red Hat AI: Modular building blocks for scalable, repeatable model customization Docling: Document intelligence SDG hub: Collection of high quality synthetic data pipelines Conclusion The adaptable enterprise: Why AI readiness is disruption readiness About the authors Aditi Saluja Jehlum Vitasta Pandit Ana Biazetti More like this Blog post Blog post Original podcast Original podcast Keep exploring Browse by channel Automation Artificial intelligence Open hybrid cloud Security Edge computing Infrastructure Applications Virtualization Share Taking generative AI (gen AI) from experimentation to enterprise deployment is never one-size-fits-all. Healthcare, finance, manufacturing, and retail each have their own vocabularies, data quirks, and compliance challenges. These complexities can’t be addressed with generic workflows because real, business-critical deployments demand depth, control, and precision. Red Hat AI offers a model customization experience that builds on the success of InstructLab , evolving it into a modular architecture powered by Python libraries created by Red Hat. This approach preserves InstructLab’s core strengths—its open, extensible pipeline for fine-tuning and instruction-following—while enabling greater flexibility and scalability for enterprise environments. With this foundation, AI experts and ML practitioners can adapt methods, orchestrate pipelines, and scale model training without losing the agility to evolve as techniques improve. The result is a more sophisticated path to enterprise-grade model customization—one that delivers adaptability and control without sacrificing speed. At the heart of this evolution are 3 core components that enable experts to fine-tune models and integrate them effectively with retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). Docling for data processing SDG hub for synthetic data generation (SDG) Training hub for fine-tuning and continual learning Since these components are modular, you can use them independently or connect them end-to-end. We will also provide more supported notebooks and AI/data science pipelines that teach you the technology as well as how to adapt it to your use case, your data, your model, and run it reliably by combining data processing, synthetic data generation, and fine-tuning techniques. Docling is our supported solution for data processing. It’s the number one open source repository for document intelligence.</description></item><item><title>Red Hat to distribute NVIDIA CUDA across Red Hat AI, RHEL and OpenShift</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-10-28-red-hat-to-distribute-nvidia-cuda-across-red-hat-ai-rhel-and-openshift/</link><pubDate>Tue, 28 Oct 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-10-28-red-hat-to-distribute-nvidia-cuda-across-red-hat-ai-rhel-and-openshift/</guid><description>Red Hat to distribute NVIDIA CUDA across Red Hat AI, RHEL and OpenShift Why this matters: Simplicity and consistency Our open source approach to AI About the author Ryan King More like this Blog post Blog post Original podcast Original podcast Keep exploring Browse by channel Automation Artificial intelligence Open hybrid cloud Security Edge computing Infrastructure Applications Virtualization Share For decades, Red Hat has been focused on providing the foundation for enterprise technology — a flexible, more consistent, and open platform. Today, as AI moves from a science experiment to a core business driver, that mission is more critical than ever. The challenge isn&amp;rsquo;t just about building AI models and AI-enabled applications; it’s about making sure the underlying infrastructure is ready to support them at scale, from the datacenter to the edge. This is why I&amp;rsquo;m so enthusiastic about the collaboration between Red Hat and NVIDIA. We&amp;rsquo;ve long worked together to bring our technologies to the open hybrid cloud, and our new agreement to distribute the NVIDIA CUDA Toolkit across the Red Hat portfolio is a testament to that collaboration. This isn&amp;rsquo;t just another collaboration; it&amp;rsquo;s about making it simpler for you to innovate with AI, no matter where you are on your journey. Today, one of the most significant barriers to AI adoption isn&amp;rsquo;t a lack of models or compute power, but rather the operational complexity of getting it all to work together. Engineers and data scientists shouldn&amp;rsquo;t have to spend their time managing dependencies, hunting for compatible drivers, or figuring out how to get their workloads running reliably on different systems. Our new agreement with NVIDIA addresses this head-on. By distributing the NVIDIA CUDA Toolkit directly within our platforms, we&amp;rsquo;re removing a major point of friction for developers and IT teams. You will be able to get the essential tools for GPU-accelerated computing from a single, trusted source. This means: A streamlined developer experience.</description></item><item><title>Take a fail-fast approach for developing RHEL upgrade automation</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-10-28-take-a-fail-fast-approach-for-developing-rhel-upgrade-automation/</link><pubDate>Tue, 28 Oct 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-10-28-take-a-fail-fast-approach-for-developing-rhel-upgrade-automation/</guid><description>Take a fail-fast approach for developing RHEL upgrade automation The challenge The solution 1.

During that time, we&amp;rsquo;ve seen dozens of customers upgrade hundreds of thousands of systems using our prescriptive, automated approach to make RHEL upgrades happen at scale. In this article, we’ll do a quick review of the key features that help accelerate the roll out of RHEL upgrade automation. We’ll look at what’s worked well, but also at some of the challenges and lessons learned. The key learning: Fail fast, iterate, and try again. The most important thing this accomplishes is making the upgrade process less scary, allowing quick recovery to the original state when things don&amp;rsquo;t go perfectly right away. Many of our biggest customers have large RHEL environments that have grown and evolved through the decades since enterprise adoption of Linux took off in the early 2000s. Organizations have tried to virtualize and containerize with the best intentions of modernizing how they deploy and manage application workloads, but some still have vast numbers of RHEL hosts that haven&amp;rsquo;t caught up.</description></item><item><title>The power of confidential containers on Red Hat OpenShift with NVIDIA GPUs</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-10-28-the-power-of-confidential-containers-on-red-hat-openshift-with-nvidia-gpus/</link><pubDate>Tue, 28 Oct 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-10-28-the-power-of-confidential-containers-on-red-hat-openshift-with-nvidia-gpus/</guid><description>The power of confidential containers on Red Hat OpenShift with NVIDIA GPUs Confidential containers on bare metal Unlocking enterprise AI with NVIDIA&amp;rsquo;s Blackwell GPUs and confidential containers Confidential containers: Securing the cloud-native AI stack End-to-end attestation: Building a chain of trust Red Hat AI Inference Server Demo: AI inferencing with CoCo bare metal and confidential GPUs Final thoughts The adaptable enterprise: Why AI readiness is disruption readiness About the authors Ariel Adam Pradipta Banerjee Jens Freimann Emanuele Giuseppe Esposito More like this Blog post Blog post Original podcast Original podcast Keep exploring Browse by channel Automation Artificial intelligence Open hybrid cloud Security Edge computing Infrastructure Applications Virtualization Share Artificial intelligence (AI) is rapidly moving from a theoretical concept to a central engine of enterprise value, transforming sectors from healthcare to finance. The capacity of AI to analyze, predict, and automate makes it an indispensable asset for modern innovation. Yet, this widespread adoption introduces a significant security imperative: as AI workloads scale, so does the risk of unauthorized access to proprietary AI models and the sensitive data they handle. These AI models are significant assets for organizations, representing substantial investments in research, training, and inferencing. Protecting them requires a robust security strategy that goes beyond traditional measures for data at rest (in storage) and in transit (over networks). The most vulnerable state is data in use, the moment it&amp;rsquo;s actively being processed in memory. This is where confidential computing emerges as a game-changer. By providing a trusted execution environment (TEE), it strengthens application security through isolation, encryption, and attestation, protecting data and code as they are being used. This approach enables a comprehensive defense-in-depth strategy, which is crucial for regulated industries handling sensitive information. By integrating these security features with a scalable, high-performance AI and machine learning (ML) ecosystem, companies can leverage AI with confidence, without sacrificing security for speed. In this blog, we will explore the usage of Red Hat OpenShift confidential containers along with NVIDIA confidential GPUs to protect AI workloads, focusing on Red Hat AI Inference Server as the workload. Confidential containers (CoCo) are a cloud-native implementation of confidential computing that brings the security of a TEE to a standard containerized workload (such as Intel TDX or AMD SEV-SNP).</description></item><item><title>Pros and Cons of Crowdfunding Your Startup | DigitalOcean (migrated)</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-10-27-pros-and-cons-of-crowdfunding-your-startup-digitalocean-migrated/</link><pubDate>Mon, 27 Oct 2025 20:37:59 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-10-27-pros-and-cons-of-crowdfunding-your-startup-digitalocean-migrated/</guid><description>Redirecting.

Why the Policy-as-Code Agent Matters Your Personal Policy Assistant Key Outcomes Why Now Try the Policy-as-Code Agent Today Policies are the backbone of Kubernetes governance. They enforce security, compliance, and operational best practices. However, for most teams, policy authoring feels like a source of friction: endless YAML, fragmented documentation, and excessive trial-and-error. The Policy-as-Code (PaC) Agent changes that. Instead of wrestling with syntax, you describe your intent in plain English. The agent generates the right Kyverno policies, scaffolds matching test cases, and even prepares Git-ready outputs. It’s not about writing YAML faster – it’s about making governance effortless, scalable, and developer-friendly. The PaC Agent is an AI-powered assistant for authoring and governing Kubernetes policies. It helps teams translate natural language intent into validated, testable Kyverno policies , bridging the gap between developer velocity and security rigor. With the PaC Agent, anyone — from developers to platform engineers — can create, test, and package policies with confidence. Policies aren’t just a compliance exercise; they directly shape the developer experience. When governance is slow or inconsistent, it creates bottlenecks in the system.</description></item><item><title>IDC Spotlight: Overcoming Kubernetes Complexity with Modern Private Cloud</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-10-27-idc-spotlight-overcoming-kubernetes-complexity-with-modern-private-cloud/</link><pubDate>Mon, 27 Oct 2025 13:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-10-27-idc-spotlight-overcoming-kubernetes-complexity-with-modern-private-cloud/</guid><description>Take the Next Step Discover more from VMware Cloud Foundation (VCF) Blog Related Articles IDC Spotlight: Overcoming Kubernetes Complexity with Modern Private Cloud Introducing the Private AI Sizing Guide VCF Breakroom Chats Episode 68: Counting down to KubeCon North America 2025 – Let’s Chat!

Chaos engineering is the practice of deliberately introducing controlled failures into a system to uncover weaknesses before they affect end users. By continuously running chaos experiments, teams can build greater confidence in their systems and identify real performance bottlenecks. However, applying chaos in real-world environments can be challenging due to the complex, dynamic nature of applications and infrastructure, especially in environments like Kubernetes. read more We compared two IBM Cloud GPU clusters—one with NVIDIA L40S GPUs and one with H100 GPUs—head‑to‑head to see what really drives distributed training performance. The key finding is that for distributed training, the choice of network architecture is the most significant factor in performance, far outweighing the capabilities of the default container networking. Our tests conclusively show that using the standard Red Hat OpenShift pod network for internode communication creates a severe performance bottleneck that prevents expensive GPU resources from being fully utilized. read more Continuous performance testing (CPT) is a critical aspect of modern software development, especially considering the mission-critical applications and diverse infrastructure on which Red Hat OpenShift can run.

For too long, the narrative around AI has been dominated by a few centralized players and proprietary platforms. That era is quickly ending. India is now part of this movement with its unique, development-centered approach to AI. I had the pleasure of presenting with Rajgopal A S, MD and CEO at NxtGen Cloud Technologies. Our joint presentation, &amp;ldquo;Sovereign AI in Action,&amp;rdquo; showcased how this vision is being realized through the powerful combination of NxtGen&amp;rsquo;s SpeedCloud and Red Hat&amp;rsquo;s open source technologies. Organizations and nations increasingly recognize the critical need for digital sovereignty—the ability to independently control and safeguard essential digital infrastructure, data, operations, technology, and supply chains in alignment with their policies, values, and strategic objectives. This is particularly urgent in India due to several interconnected challenges: Data control and protection: Governments see sovereign AI as vital for protecting data privacy and safeguarding national security. This requires controlling where data is stored, who can access it, and how it’s used, often insisting on data staying within specific national or regional borders. The growth of data sovereignty laws and data protection rules worldwide means companies are having to adjust quickly. Technological independence: There&amp;rsquo;s also a strong desire to reduce reliance on external providers&amp;rsquo; infrastructure and technologies amid geopolitical uncertainties. Currently, 95% of accelerator-enabled public cloud regions use US-owned accelerators, showing a concentration of control.</description></item><item><title>VCF Breakroom Chats Episode 67 – The Language of Cloud: Decoding Namespaces, Projects, and Orgs in VMware Cloud Foundation</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-10-23-vcf-breakroom-chats-episode-67-the-language-of-cloud-decoding-namespaces-project/</link><pubDate>Thu, 23 Oct 2025 13:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-10-23-vcf-breakroom-chats-episode-67-the-language-of-cloud-decoding-namespaces-project/</guid><description>VCF Breakroom Chats Episode 67 About the VCF Breakroom Chat Series Discover more from VMware Cloud Foundation (VCF) Blog Related Articles Introducing the Private AI Sizing Guide VCF Breakroom Chats Episode 68: Counting down to KubeCon North America 2025 – Let’s Chat!

While the benefits are clear, large-scale modernization projects can be complex, time-consuming, and require significant upfront investment. With the introduction of migration toolkit for applications 8 (MTA 8), Red Hat is helping organizations overcome these challenges by automating key parts of the modernization journey. The migration toolkit for applications has long provided tools for containerization readiness, source-code analysis, and project management. MTA 8 builds on this foundation by introducing two major new capabilities: automated replatforming and intelligent refactoring. Replatforming—migrating an application from one platform to another with minimal code changes—is a common modernization strategy that can deliver significant benefits like improved scalability, security, and cost-efficiency. However, even this approach can be time-consuming due to a number of manual, error-prone tasks. MTA 8 automates this process by generating the necessary deployment artifacts to run an application on Red Hat OpenShift. The first supported migration path is from Cloud Foundry to OpenShift, enabling users to: Discover and analyze applications: MTA connects to the source platform to identify applications and extract crucial deployment and runtime information. Generate deployment assets: Using this normalized data, MTA translates the configuration into the target platform format by leveraging Helm Charts to create deployment manifests for OpenShift. Streamline deployment: The resulting artifacts are automatically placed in a target repository, which can be picked up by CI/CD pipelines for automated deployment. This automation helps to reduce manual work and improve the ROI of application modernization projects.</description></item><item><title>Kubernetes v1.35.0-alpha.2</title><link>https://kubermates.org/releases/2025-10-22-kubernetes-v1-35-0-alpha-2/</link><pubDate>Wed, 22 Oct 2025 22:03:54 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/releases/2025-10-22-kubernetes-v1-35-0-alpha-2/</guid><description>See kubernetes-announce@.

In the following entries in this series, weâll deploy an open source Proof of Concept (PoC) , configure roles and policies for workload identity access control, spin up a Droplet, write a GitHub Actions workflow, and access databases and Spaces keys from them using their respective workload identity tokens. Workload identity is used to reduce the amount of secrets involved in deploying and administrating software systems. Instead of authentication being done based on something a workload knows, for example passwords or API tokens, authentication is done based on what the workload is. The heart of workload identity federation is asymmetric cryptography. By leveraging public / private key pairs, tokens can be issued to workloads, such as Droplets, and used for authentication and authorization to APIs exposed by resource servers. Workload identity tokens are exchanged for domain specific access tokens, or grant access to resources directly. This series showcases how we can use DigitalOceanâs OAuth API and fine grained permission scopes to implement and leverage workload identity federation using OpenID Connect (OIDC) protocol tokens. Weâll enable secretless access to DigitalOcean hosted databases and Spaces buckets from Droplets and GitHub Actions workflows. Eliminating the need to provision static, long-lived credentials for databases and Spaces buckets for those environments. Authentication based on what the workload is requires that the infrastructure orchestrating the workload be able to make verifiable claims about a workloadâs properties. To do this, the infrastructure responsible for running the workload enables issuance of workload-specific tokens containing these claims.</description></item><item><title>VMware Cloud on AWS: VMC Console UI Migration to Broadcom</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-10-22-vmware-cloud-on-aws-vmc-console-ui-migration-to-broadcom/</link><pubDate>Wed, 22 Oct 2025 18:36:18 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-10-22-vmware-cloud-on-aws-vmc-console-ui-migration-to-broadcom/</guid><description>Discover more from VMware Cloud Foundation (VCF) Blog Related Articles VMware Cloud on AWS: VMC Console UI Migration to Broadcom VCF Breakroom Chats Episode 66 - VCF Automation Org Types Demystified: Debunking Misconceptions about VM &amp;amp; All Apps Orgs VMware Workstation &amp;amp; Fusion 25H2: Embracing Calendar Versioning and New Features Last Update: October 22, 2025 Editorial Note: This is a living blog featuring important service updates regarding the migration of the VMware Cloud on AWS Console from VMware to Broadcom.

How llm-d Helps solve the observability gap Example PromQL queries Example dashboard Conclusion The adaptable enterprise: Why AI readiness is disruption readiness About the authors Christopher Nuland Sally O&amp;rsquo;Malley More like this Blog post Blog post Original podcast Original podcast Keep exploring Browse by channel Automation Artificial intelligence Open hybrid cloud Security Edge computing Infrastructure Applications Virtualization Share As enterprises scale large language models (LLMs) into production, site reliability engineers (SREs) and platform operators face a new set of challenges. Traditional application metrics—CPU usage, request throughput, memory consumption—are no longer enough. With LLMs, reliability and efficacy are defined by entirely new dynamics—token-level performance, cache efficiency, and inference pipeline latency. This article explores how llm-d , an open source project co-developed with the leading AI vendors (Red Hat, Google, IBM, etc. ) and integrated into Red Hat OpenShift AI 3.0, redefines observability for LLM workloads. Users expect responsive applications, including those enhanced with AI, and enterprises require consistent performance to turn a pilot project into a profitable production application at scale. While SLOs in traditional microservice architectures are usually framed around request latency and error rate , the user experience for LLMs depends on more nuanced measures, including: Time to first token (TTFT): Measures the delay before the initial token of a response is streamed to the user. A lower TTFT is needed to provide a responsive and immediate user experience, especially in interactive applications. Time per output token (TPOT): Indicates the speed at which tokens are generated after the process begins. A consistent and low TPOT provides a smooth and efficient streaming of the complete response to the user. Cache hit rate: Represents the proportion of requests that can use previously computed context stored in GPU memory. A high cache hit rate significantly reduces computational overhead and improves overall system throughput by avoiding redundant processing.</description></item><item><title>Modernize: Migrate from SUSE Rancher RKE1 to Red Hat OpenShift</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-10-22-modernize-migrate-from-suse-rancher-rke1-to-red-hat-openshift/</link><pubDate>Wed, 22 Oct 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-10-22-modernize-migrate-from-suse-rancher-rke1-to-red-hat-openshift/</guid><description>Modernize: Migrate from SUSE Rancher RKE1 to Red Hat OpenShift Why Red Hat OpenShift is the right choice for your business Enhanced security and consistency A rich developer experience and ecosystem Enterprise support How to migrate from RKE1 to Red Hat OpenShift Assessment and planning (Pre-migration) Platform and configuration migration Workload migration and validation Cutover and decommissioning Why choose Red Hat?

Recent global events—from supply chain disruptions to geopolitical conflicts—have underscored the critical need for greater control over their technology. Digital sovereignty is a strategic effort for organizations to build greater resilience, choice and confidence into IT environments. This isn’t a move towards isolation, with true sovereignty requiring more than just local data centers. Businesses are re-evaluating their provider dependencies and are increasingly looking for a flexible approach that allows them to define their own digital destiny through a collaborative and open ecosystem of partners. While data residency is crucial, it&amp;rsquo;s just one part of a larger, more complex picture. An effective sovereign cloud solution is built on four interconnected pillars: Assurance Sovereignty: Verifying that processes and security standards are met, and verifying that platforms are built to the required standards and certified for regulated industries like banking and government. Operational Sovereignty: Maintaining control over system management, monitoring, and who deploys and maintains the systems. Data Sovereignty: Having control over where data is stored and processed, and maintaining a high level of protection from extra-territorial influences. Technical Sovereignty: Exerting full control of IT environments by using open standards and technology to prevent dependencies on specific providers. An open source approach is fundamental to a sovereignty strategy because it provides a transparent foundation where customers can inspect and trust the underlying technology. However, technology alone isn&amp;rsquo;t enough; a strong partner ecosystem—particularly in Europe—is essential to act as a multiplier, helping organizations to meet their sovereignty goals.</description></item><item><title>Announcing the General Availability of Holodeck 9.0.1.0</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-10-21-announcing-the-general-availability-of-holodeck-9-0-1-0/</link><pubDate>Tue, 21 Oct 2025 21:28:43 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-10-21-announcing-the-general-availability-of-holodeck-9-0-1-0/</guid><description>Project Contributors Discover more from VMware Cloud Foundation (VCF) Blog Related Articles Announcing the General Availability of Holodeck 9.0.1.0 From Spend to Value: The Advantage of Private Cloud VCF Breakroom Chats Episode 65: VMware Cloud Foundation with Ubuntu OS - Smarter Choice for Modern Apps We’re excited to announce the General Availability of Holodeck 9.0.1.0, building upon the success of Holodeck 9.0 to further empower your teams in deploying standardized and automated nested VMware Cloud Foundation (VCF) environments! A sincere thank you from the team to the thousands of folks that downloaded and tried out Holodeck 9.0, we appreciate the engagement and feedback. It’s helped us further shape and grow the tool! In today’s fast-paced technological landscape, the ability to rapidly and reliably test new technical capabilities is paramount. While deploying nested VCF environments has always been possible, it often involves time-consuming manual configurations and significant hardware overhead. Holodeck continues to change the game by providing a self-contained, automated, and repeatable solution that dramatically reduces complexity and resource requirements, now with even more robust features. Some highlights: New-HoloDeckConfig: This cmdlet now validates the integrity of the config. json template. If the template file’s integrity does not match, the user will see a warning before a new config file is created for the Holodeck instance. Ideally, users are not expected to modify the template config file; however, there may be edge cases where a customer chooses to do so. In such cases, the warning ensures they are informed of the change. Remove-HoloDeckInstance: This cmdlet has a new optional parameter to support the automated deletion of the holodeck instance. If not specified, then the instance ID will be captured from the global config file. Also, the prompt for user confirmation is removed, instead, the user will have 15 seconds to abort the operation by pressing any key on the console.</description></item><item><title>How Discover cut $1.4 million from its annual AWS budget in two game days</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-10-21-how-discover-cut-1-4-million-from-its-annual-aws-budget-in-two-game-days/</link><pubDate>Tue, 21 Oct 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-10-21-how-discover-cut-1-4-million-from-its-annual-aws-budget-in-two-game-days/</guid><description>How Discover cut $1.4 million from its annual AWS budget in two game days 2 Days, $1.4 million Tagging workloads Technology and developer culture Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform | Product Trial About the author Alex Handy More like this Blog post Blog post Original podcast Original podcast Keep exploring Browse by channel Automation Artificial intelligence Open hybrid cloud Security Edge computing Infrastructure Applications Virtualization Share Do you remember shared cell phone plans? At the turn of the century, a whole family might share the same pool of mobile phone minutes, and it only took a few hours of idle chatter on the phone to drain the account of all remaining minutes of talk time for everyone. Well, a similar phenomenon is currently happening in the cloud today. Anyone who&amp;rsquo;s ever touched a public cloud has likely encountered an accidental overage payment. That&amp;rsquo;s a problem, but it&amp;rsquo;s even more problematic that it&amp;rsquo;s deceptively easy to overlook a single instance of this when you&amp;rsquo;re dealing in hundreds at a time. At Discover, the financial services company recently acquired by Capital One, developers found a way to solve their overage problems—and implement serious cost savings. It’s not surprising that a company offering credit cards would understand the value of cost optimization in the cloud. What is surprising, however, is that in those two days, they managed to cut their cloud bill by $1.4 million each year. Discover moved onto Red Hat OpenShift in 2022. Prior to that, the company had been attempting to solidify on CloudFoundry, the Platform-as-a-Service often promoted by Pivotal, VMware, and Broadcom. Craig Katz, OpenShift Director at Discover, said that Discover now uses OpenShift to manage its container infrastructure inside of Amazon Web Services. In order to migrate their existing 1,200 workloads to OpenShift and Amazon Web Services, the decision was made early on to focus on the speed and quality of the transition, and to push cost concerns to the side. As Katz put it, &amp;ldquo;You can choose two: fast, cheap, or good.</description></item><item><title>Learn Red Hat OpenShift Virtualization concepts from a VMware Admin Background with this learning path</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-10-21-learn-red-hat-openshift-virtualization-concepts-from-a-vmware-admin-background-w/</link><pubDate>Tue, 21 Oct 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-10-21-learn-red-hat-openshift-virtualization-concepts-from-a-vmware-admin-background-w/</guid><description>Learn Red Hat OpenShift Virtualization concepts from a VMware Admin Background with this learning path Benefits of the VMware OpenShift Virtualization learning path How to use the path effectively A new chapter: Daily virtualization tasks Why this matters now Red Hat Learning Subscription | Product Trial About the authors Carolyn May Ryan Capra More like this Blog post Blog post Keep exploring Browse by channel Automation Artificial intelligence Open hybrid cloud Security Edge computing Infrastructure Applications Virtualization Share If you’re a virtual machine (VM) administrator who’s spent years managing VMs in vSphere and are now considering how Red Hat OpenShift Virtualization might fit into your operational world, we’ve built something just for you.

While the initial cost of training a large language model (LLM) can be significant, the real and often underestimated expense is tied to inference. AI inference —the process of using a trained model to generate an output—is the most resource-intensive and costly part of an AI application, especially because it happens constantly during production. Inefficient inference can compromise an AI project&amp;rsquo;s potential return on investment (ROI) and negatively impact customer experience due to high latency. Effectively serving LLMs at scale requires a strategic, full-stack approach that addresses both the model itself and the serving runtime. A single approach is not enough. Achieving high performance and cost efficiency requires a dual focus—managing resource consumption and maximizing throughput. A strategic part of this approach is model compression, which reduces a model&amp;rsquo;s size and resource requirements without compromising accuracy. Quantization is a key technique for model optimization. It reduces the precision of a model&amp;rsquo;s numerical values—like its weights and activations—from standard 16-bit to lower formats such as 8-bit or 4-bit. This significantly shrinks the model’s memory footprint, allowing it to run on less hardware. Sparsity is another effective method, which makes models more efficient by removing unnecessary connections (weights).</description></item><item><title>7 Common Kubernetes Pitfalls (and How I Learned to Avoid Them)</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-10-20-7-common-kubernetes-pitfalls-and-how-i-learned-to-avoid-them/</link><pubDate>Mon, 20 Oct 2025 08:30:00 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-10-20-7-common-kubernetes-pitfalls-and-how-i-learned-to-avoid-them/</guid><description>7 Common Kubernetes Pitfalls (and How I Learned to Avoid Them) 1.

Energy costs can make up a substantial portion of the operating expenditure (OPEX) budget, potentially serving as a critical factor in the success or failure of a business. This article breaks down the issue of energy efficiency in modern server platforms, presenting tools and an example methodology for measuring power consumption and performance. As a case study, we present measurement results from two server platforms with different CPU architectures. We will emphasize network performance (including throughput measurements), CPU utilization, and power consumption, with a particular emphasis on achieving the highest possible throughput per watt of energy consumed. Evaluating the relationship between a computer’s performance and its power requirements can be broken down into three key steps: Assess the computer’s performance Measure the computer’s power requirements Normalize performance relative to power consumption We measure system performance in terms of gigabits per second of achievable throughput per physical CPU core. It is important to note that with modern, high-speed (100 Gbps and above) Ethernet adapters, it&amp;rsquo;s virtually impossible for a single user-space process to utilize all available bandwidth. Moreover, network throughput is only part of the performance story. Handling network traffic ideally consumes minimal resources, leaving the majority of the system available for creating or processing the data transmitted over the network. Ideally, the CPU is saturated with as few cores as possible. To quantify these requirements, we monitor the following metrics: Maximum achievable throughput in gigabits per second. Total CPU utilization, measured in cores.</description></item><item><title>Busting Cyber Resilience Myths with VMware Cloud Foundation</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-10-16-busting-cyber-resilience-myths-with-vmware-cloud-foundation/</link><pubDate>Thu, 16 Oct 2025 19:07:43 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-10-16-busting-cyber-resilience-myths-with-vmware-cloud-foundation/</guid><description>Discover more from VMware Cloud Foundation (VCF) Blog Related Articles Busting Cyber Resilience Myths with VMware Cloud Foundation VMware at KubeCon North America 2025: Innovation at the Core of Cloud Native VCF Breakroom Chats Episode 64 - AI Made Simple: Empowering VI Admins to Offer Private AI with VCF 9.0 “What you don’t know, won’t hurt you” is a dangerous assumption when it comes to cyber resilience.

Connect to Red Hat Insights Red Hat Enterprise Linux | Product trial About the authors Shane McDowell Anthony Johnson More like this Blog post Blog post Original podcast Original podcast Keep exploring Browse by channel Automation Artificial intelligence Open hybrid cloud Security Edge computing Infrastructure Applications Virtualization Share The most common task facing system administrators is patching infrastructure. It&amp;rsquo;s time consuming, it requires coordination with application teams and stakeholders, and it often must happen in segments over time. These complications make it difficult to maintain environmental consistency, which in turn can lead to instability, performance issues, and more time spent by operations staff. Using Red Hat Insights content templates to patch Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) helps limit the complexity of these activities while also increasing consistency across an IT estate. Using Red Hat Insights, the process is simplified and more prescriptive: Define the software you want in your environment, instruct your Red Hat Insights-registered systems to pull updates from that set of software, and patch. It doesn&amp;rsquo;t matter whether you patch your RHEL system today or three weeks from now, you can have greater confidence that the updates installed in your environment are the ones you want, and nothing more. For each subsequent patch cycle, you update your definition, which automatically instructs your systems to pull updates from this new set of updates, and you patch. In Red Hat Insights, this set of software is called a content template. You can create a content template on the Hybrid Cloud Console content template page. A content template is defined by a date and a set of package repositories, which can include those provided by Red Hat, partners, or custom repositories created by you. Any system you associate with that content template is automatically limited to the set of updates from those repositories on the date you&amp;rsquo;ve selected. You can then update your systems using the schedule and method of your choosing, knowing that the end result will be systems with a more predictable and consistent set of software installed.</description></item><item><title>Automation unlocks 5G's full potential: One New Zealand's journey</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-10-15-automation-unlocks-5g-s-full-potential-one-new-zealand-s-journey/</link><pubDate>Wed, 15 Oct 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-10-15-automation-unlocks-5g-s-full-potential-one-new-zealand-s-journey/</guid><description>Automation unlocks 5G&amp;rsquo;s full potential: One New Zealand&amp;rsquo;s journey One New Zealand&amp;rsquo;s journey to automated 5G Key takeaways Red Hat Ansible Automation Platform | Product Trial About the authors Volker Tegtmeyer Sam Sun Poohmipat Sripukdee (Art) More like this Blog post Blog post Original podcast Original podcast Keep exploring Browse by channel Automation Artificial intelligence Open hybrid cloud Security Edge computing Infrastructure Applications Virtualization Share The telecommunications (telco) industry stands at the precipice of a new era. With 5G networks rapidly expanding, service providers face both immense opportunities and significant challenges. The promise of 5G for ultra-fast speeds, low latency, and massive connectivity hinges on the ability to operationalize these complex networks with unprecedented efficiency and rigorous security measures. Automation is not just a buzzword in this landscape; it’s how to unlock the full value of 5G. Traditional manual processes simply cannot keep pace with the dynamic demands of modern networks. As network functions become increasingly containerized and cloud-native, the need for agile, consistent, and secure operations across hybrid and multicloud environments increases exponentially. Service providers want to invest in innovation to efficiently grow revenue, and automation is key to lowering costs and accelerating time to value on the journey to autonomous networks. Data and AI also deliver value across business and network aspects of telcos to mitigate risk, lower operational costs, and optimize resources. One New Zealand and Red Hat recently hosted a webinar featuring Sam Sun, Account Solution Architect at Red Hat, and Art Sripukdee, Principal Architect from One New Zealand. They shared a compelling story of how One New Zealand transformed its 5G vision into reality, achieving economies of scale, efficiency, and building a network designed for growth. One New Zealand, a leading telco provider, has consistently been at the forefront of mobile technology, from 2G to 5G, and recently launched text messaging over satellite. Their 5G rollout is not merely about new radio sites; it’s completely transforming network architecture.</description></item><item><title>From bottleneck to breakthrough: How Citizens Bank modernized integration with Red Hat OpenShift</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-10-15-from-bottleneck-to-breakthrough-how-citizens-bank-modernized-integration-with-re/</link><pubDate>Wed, 15 Oct 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-10-15-from-bottleneck-to-breakthrough-how-citizens-bank-modernized-integration-with-re/</guid><description>From bottleneck to breakthrough: How Citizens Bank modernized integration with Red Hat OpenShift The adaptable enterprise: Why AI readiness is disruption readiness About the author Jaleh Reeves More like this Blog post Blog post Original podcast Original podcast Keep exploring Browse by channel Automation Artificial intelligence Open hybrid cloud Security Edge computing Infrastructure Applications Virtualization Share Tikhnadhi Kamlakshya , vice president and manager of software engineering at Citizens Bank, saw a clear challenge: his team had a critical disconnect between their modern Salesforce platform and their legacy loan processing system, Black Knight. This gap created a significant bottleneck, hindering the bank&amp;rsquo;s ability to scale its mortgage operations and forcing loan officers to spend hours manually entering data. The main issue stemmed from communication difficulties between the 2 essential systems they relied on for their tasks. On one side, there was the modern, agile Salesforce platform, the bank&amp;rsquo;s system for point of sale. On the other, the Black Knight system, a business-critical, legacy application that handled all loan processing and governance. The 2 systems couldn&amp;rsquo;t talk to each other, and with millions of records to process, the bank was facing a scalability crisis. &amp;ldquo;We were under enormous pressure,&amp;rdquo; Kamlakshya recalls. &amp;ldquo;We had successfully migrated to Salesforce, but the job wasn&amp;rsquo;t finished. The fact that Salesforce couldn&amp;rsquo;t talk to our legacy system was a curveball we hadn&amp;rsquo;t anticipated. &amp;quot; The search for a solution The team at Citizens Bank explored several integration tools, but none could handle the scale and authentication requirements of the project.

But when it comes time to visualizing and proving that value to business leaders and other stakeholders, the story often falls short. That changes with the new automation dashboard, available with Red Hat Ansible Automation Platform 2.6. Automation dashboard delivers real-time, actionable insights to help guide your day-to-day operations. You gain greater visibility across the entire automation footprint, both direct and indirect nodes, helping identify over-utilization and under-utilization of your Ansible Automation Platform subscriptions. That means you can better optimize and right-size your automation deployments, while executives can more readily see efficiency gains translated into business outcomes. The automation dashboard acts as a business case generator that runs 24/7. It continuously measures: Job success rates : A clear picture of what’s running smoothly. Time savings : Hours returned to teams across the business. Return on investment : Actual dollars saved by automation. With exportable PDF and CSV reports, IT leaders and automation teams can show exactly how much automation is saving, whether that’s proving ROI to a CFO, sharing successes with stakeholders, or identifying opportunities to optimize. Renewal cycles often trigger tough budget conversations.</description></item><item><title>Open source and AI-assisted development: navigating the legal issues</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-10-15-open-source-and-ai-assisted-development-navigating-the-legal-issues/</link><pubDate>Wed, 15 Oct 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-10-15-open-source-and-ai-assisted-development-navigating-the-legal-issues/</guid><description>Open source and AI-assisted development: navigating the legal issues Attribution and marking Copyright and licensing formalities Are AI tools “plagiarism machines”? AI-assisted contributions and the DCO Establishing trust Looking ahead The adaptable enterprise: Why AI readiness is disruption readiness About the authors Chris Wright Richard Fontana More like this Blog post Blog post Original podcast Original podcast Browse by channel Automation Artificial intelligence Open hybrid cloud Security Edge computing Infrastructure Applications Virtualization Share In our previous post in this series, we talked about how AI is beginning to change the way software is developed. In this follow-up, we focus on some of the main legal (or quasi-legal) issues that open source developers themselves have been raising regarding AI-assisted development. This isn’t a comprehensive overview of every legal issue connected to AI. We aren’t addressing, for example, customer concerns about compliance with AI regulations or liability issues relating to contracts for AI-powered products. Instead, we’re focusing on issues that are being actively debated inside open source communities. Our views on these issues reflect our commitment to responsible use of AI technologies and our “default to open” philosophy. We believe that collaborative and transparent approaches are the best ways to address these concerns constructively. Attribution is a core legal and cultural norm in open source. Licenses generally require you to preserve copyright and authorship notices, and to avoid misleading claims of authorship. AI-assisted development complicates this. Because AI systems are not considered “authors” under copyright law, there is technically no one to credit. But it would still be misleading for a developer to present substantial AI-generated output as purely their own work.</description></item><item><title>VMware Workstation &amp; Fusion 25H2: Embracing Calendar Versioning and New Features</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-10-14-vmware-workstation-fusion-25h2-embracing-calendar-versioning-and-new-features/</link><pubDate>Tue, 14 Oct 2025 13:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-10-14-vmware-workstation-fusion-25h2-embracing-calendar-versioning-and-new-features/</guid><description>A Clearer Versioning Model Key New Features Expanded CPU and OS Support Bug Fixes and Improvements Customer Questions &amp;amp; Support Global Availability Looking Ahead Discover more from VMware Cloud Foundation (VCF) Blog Related Articles VMware Workstation &amp;amp; Fusion 25H2: Embracing Calendar Versioning and New Features VCF Breakroom Chats Episode 65: VMware Cloud Foundation with Ubuntu OS - Smarter Choice for Modern Apps VCF Breakroom Chats Episode 64 - AI Made Simple: Empowering VI Admins to Offer Private AI with VCF 9.0 We’re excited to announce VMware Workstation 25H2 and VMware Fusion 25H2 , the latest updates to our desktop hypervisors.

At the time, it felt early. Now, the evidence is undeniable: hearings, regulatory framework being prioritized , and market pivots prove that what mattered then matters even more now. Sovereignty has gone from an abstract concept to a key customer consideration. Establishing a compliance requirement around sovereignty is becoming a key discussion point in Europe. This blog builds on that foundation. We’ll examine why “sovereign by label” clouds fall short, point to real market signals that expose the gap, and lay out a practical checklist that buyers — and vendors — should demand. Because in 2025, the conversation is no longer about who can market sovereignty, but who can prove it. *** Many traditional public cloud vendors now sell “sovereign” clouds. But a label and local data centers do not erase legal exposure, control-plane dependencies, or auditability gaps. Recent admissions and market moves show the problem : when push comes to shove, control, whether in the form of jurisdiction or on data flows matters more than a marketing name. Let’s unpack the different aspects of this reality, point to concrete market signals, and discuss a practical checklist that buyers and platform vendors should demand if they mean “sovereign” in anything but name only.</description></item><item><title>Beyond the model: Why intelligent infrastructure is the next AI frontier</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-10-14-beyond-the-model-why-intelligent-infrastructure-is-the-next-ai-frontier/</link><pubDate>Tue, 14 Oct 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-10-14-beyond-the-model-why-intelligent-infrastructure-is-the-next-ai-frontier/</guid><description>Beyond the model: Why intelligent infrastructure is the next AI frontier The new challenge: Distributed AI inference A shared vision for a shared problem llm-d: A blueprint for production-grade AI Final thoughts The adaptable enterprise: Why AI readiness is disruption readiness About the author Chris Wright More like this Blog post Blog post Original podcast Original podcast Keep exploring Browse by channel Automation Artificial intelligence Open hybrid cloud Security Edge computing Infrastructure Applications Virtualization Share Your large language model (LLM) proof of concept (PoC) was a success. Now what? The jump from a single server to production-grade, distributed AI inference is where most enterprises hit a wall. The infrastructure that got you this far just can&amp;rsquo;t keep up. As discussed in a recent episode of the Technically Speaking podcast , most organizations&amp;rsquo; AI journey and PoCs begin with deploying a model on a single server—a manageable task. But the next step often requires a massive leap to distributed, production-grade AI inference. This is not simply a matter of adding more machines—we believe this requires a new kind of intelligence within the infrastructure itself—an AI-aware control plane that can help manage the complexity of these unique and dynamic workloads. Deploying LLMs at scale introduces a set of challenges that traditional infrastructure isn&amp;rsquo;t designed to handle. A standard web server, for example, processes uniform requests. In contrast, an AI inference request can be unpredictable and resource-intensive, with variable demands on compute, memory, and networking. Think of it like modern logistics. Moving a small package from one city to another is straightforward. But coordinating a global supply chain requires intelligent logistics management—a system that can track thousands of shipments, dynamically route different types of cargo, and tweak scheduling so everything arrives on time.</description></item><item><title>Deploy with confidence: Announcing the latest Red Hat AI validated models</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-10-14-deploy-with-confidence-announcing-the-latest-red-hat-ai-validated-models/</link><pubDate>Tue, 14 Oct 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-10-14-deploy-with-confidence-announcing-the-latest-red-hat-ai-validated-models/</guid><description>Deploy with confidence: Announcing the latest Red Hat AI validated models What are validated models?

The real challenge isn&amp;rsquo;t just the technology—it&amp;rsquo;s building an AI strategy that is scalable, reliable, and manageable. Standardization is a primary factor in meeting this challenge, primarily by reducing complexity and increasing efficiency. By combining Model Context Protocol (MCP) and Llama Stack on a platform like Red Hat OpenShift AI , you can create a unified and portable environment for your AI applications. OpenShift AI can also support the integration of any other agentic frameworks and components you like, including tools like LangChain, LangGraph, and CrewAI, among others. Red Hat&amp;rsquo;s approach can help simplify development, streamline operations, and give your enterprise the tools it needs to empower your multiple teams, like AI developers and data scientists to turn your AI vision into a reality within a trusted and consistent environment. To build resilient AI-enabled applications, you need a foundation that enables intelligent agents to access and use your enterprise&amp;rsquo;s specific tools and data. This requires 2 key components: a standardized way to expose your services and a unified framework for interacting with them. This is the essence of agentic AI , where an autonomous system can determine the best course of action and tools needed to achieve a goal. The combination of MCP and Llama Stack provides the framework for these agents to operate effectively. MCP is an open protocol that standardizes how your AI systems integrate with external tools and data sources. It has been described as being a &amp;ldquo;USB-C port for AI applications.</description></item><item><title>VMware at KubeCon North America 2025: Innovation at the Core of Cloud Native</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-10-13-vmware-at-kubecon-north-america-2025-innovation-at-the-core-of-cloud-native/</link><pubDate>Mon, 13 Oct 2025 16:54:21 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-10-13-vmware-at-kubecon-north-america-2025-innovation-at-the-core-of-cloud-native/</guid><description>What to Expect at the VMware Booth (#1010) Check Out the Demo Theater Session Sign up for Expert-led KubeCon Community Breakout Sessions Dive Deeper into VKS Discover more from VMware Cloud Foundation (VCF) Blog Related Articles VMware at KubeCon North America 2025: Innovation at the Core of Cloud Native VCF Breakroom Chats Episode 64 - AI Made Simple: Empowering VI Admins to Offer Private AI with VCF 9.0 VCF Breakroom Chats Episode 63 - No Experience Needed: Demystifying Kubernetes for Aspiring Cloud Admins with VCF 9.0 KubeCon + CloudNativeCon returns to North America November 10–13, 2025 in Atlanta, and VMware by Broadcom is excited to be a Platinum Sponsor of this important community gathering.

The ideal path to modernization combines compute, storage, and networking into a single, cohesive system that&amp;rsquo;s easy to deploy. It uses enterprise-grade storage for intelligent data management, and runs on an enterprise-tested application platform that handles containers and virtual machines (VM) in a unified environment. It allows you to develop and deploy applications in your data center, and then move them to the cloud as needed, without retooling. Ultimately, modernization done well helps your developers deploy applications faster, lets your IT teams (from network to storage to sysadmins) coordinate, and saves you time and money. Enterprise IT cannot rely on trial and error. Consider hardware, for instance. It would take weeks (if not months) to piece together compute, storage, and networking from multiple vendors. Then there&amp;rsquo;s integration testing, stress and load testing. Then there&amp;rsquo;s the constant worry about whether you deployed the most efficient and cost effective solution. And that&amp;rsquo;s before you even get to the application stack. Are you trying to modernize from a legacy monolithic architecture to a more modern, cloud-native approach? Do you need a hypervisor for virtual machines? Can you scale and migrate applications from on-premises to a cloud hyperscaler without refactoring? A solution to this problem is needed now, more than ever.</description></item><item><title>What to know before you install or upgrade to Red Hat Ansible Automation Platform 2.6</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-10-13-what-to-know-before-you-install-or-upgrade-to-red-hat-ansible-automation-platfor/</link><pubDate>Mon, 13 Oct 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-10-13-what-to-know-before-you-install-or-upgrade-to-red-hat-ansible-automation-platfor/</guid><description>What to know before you install or upgrade to Red Hat Ansible Automation Platform 2.6 New installations of Ansible Automation Platform 2.6 Installing on RHEL RHEL containerized installation (recommended) RHEL RPM installation (deprecated) Installing on Red Hat OpenShift Upgrade and migration paths to Ansible Automation Platform 2.6 Deployment type migrations: Moving between RPM, container, and operator Migrating Ansible Automation Platform across RHEL versions Migrating across PostgreSQL versions Upgrading from Ansible Automation Platform 2.4 to 2.6 Upgrading from Ansible Automation Platform 2.5 to 2.6 Additional resources Red Hat Ansible Automation Platform | Product Trial About the author Leonardo Gallego More like this Blog post Blog post Original podcast Original podcast Keep exploring Browse by channel Automation Artificial intelligence Open hybrid cloud Security Edge computing Infrastructure Applications Virtualization Share Red Hat Ansible Automation Platform 2.6 introduces powerful capabilities for managing, scaling, and deploying automation across your enterprise.

Read our full conversation here. For the last several years, the narrative around artificial intelligence (AI) has been dominated by large language models (LLMs) and the monumental effort of training them. The technology industry has been focused on the discovery phase—but that era is rapidly shifting. The conversation is moving from, &amp;ldquo;How do we build the model?&amp;rdquo; to, &amp;ldquo;How do we actually run the model in production at scale?&amp;rdquo; This shift is more than a technical detail; it’s the new center of gravity for enterprise AI. When AI leaves the research lab and becomes a core business capability, the focus lands squarely on inference—the firing synapses in a trained model’s “brain” before it generates an answer or takes action. And in the enterprise, inference must be fast, cost-effective, and fully controlled. Moving AI from a proof-of-concept into a reliable, production-grade service introduces significant complexity, cost, and control challenges for IT leaders. Firstly, the hardware required to run these models—especially at the scale the enterprise needs—is expensive and often scarce. Secondly, demand is unpredictable. You might have bursts of high usage followed by long periods of low activity, which can be compounded across hundreds of variants of domain-purposed models. This variability makes it extremely difficult to maximize resource utilization and protect those critical investments.</description></item><item><title>VCF Breakroom Chats Episode 65: VMware Cloud Foundation with Ubuntu OS – Smarter Choice for Modern Apps</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-10-09-vcf-breakroom-chats-episode-65-vmware-cloud-foundation-with-ubuntu-os-smarter-ch/</link><pubDate>Thu, 09 Oct 2025 21:23:15 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-10-09-vcf-breakroom-chats-episode-65-vmware-cloud-foundation-with-ubuntu-os-smarter-ch/</guid><description>Discover more from VMware Cloud Foundation (VCF) Blog Related Articles VCF Breakroom Chats Episode 65: VMware Cloud Foundation with Ubuntu OS - Smarter Choice for Modern Apps VCF Breakroom Chats Episode 64 - AI Made Simple: Empowering VI Admins to Offer Private AI with VCF 9.0 VCF Breakroom Chats Episode 63 - No Experience Needed: Demystifying Kubernetes for Aspiring Cloud Admins with VCF 9.0 Welcome to episode 65 of the VCF Breakroom Chats.

But the reality for many organizations is that developers are spending a significant amount of their valuable time on tasks other than coding. Research from a recent ShiftMag survey reveals that developers lose an average of 8 hours each week to inefficiencies such as technical debt and insufficient documentation. These frustrations are not just a nuisance, they&amp;rsquo;re a drain on productivity that can lead to burnout and a substantial loss of potential output for the business. This is why platform engineering has emerged as a strategic imperative for businesses. According to Gartner , an estimated 80% of large software engineering organizations will establish platform engineering teams by 2026 to provide reusable services and tools for application delivery. The path to building a successful internal developer platform can be daunting. With so many tools and processes to consider, it can be difficult to know where to begin. This is precisely why Red Hat created the Developer Experience Assessment workshop. This two-week interactive workshop provides an increased understanding of the current developer experience, platform engineering teams, and DevOps principles through a classroom-style discovery workshop. This workshop is designed to help teams uncover hidden friction points between teams and map out the application onboarding and development lifecycle. The outcome is a tailored roadmap, or recipe, for how to improve your DevEx and scale platform adoption.</description></item><item><title>Enterprise AI survey: ambition, the value gap, and the importance of open source</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-10-09-enterprise-ai-survey-ambition-the-value-gap-and-the-importance-of-open-source/</link><pubDate>Thu, 09 Oct 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-10-09-enterprise-ai-survey-ambition-the-value-gap-and-the-importance-of-open-source/</guid><description>Enterprise AI survey: ambition, the value gap, and the importance of open source About the author Hans Roth More like this Blog post Blog post Original podcast Original podcast Browse by channel Automation Artificial intelligence Open hybrid cloud Security Edge computing Infrastructure Applications Virtualization Share EMEA organizations are primed for widespread AI adoption, and see enterprise open source as an important success factor; however, their ability to scale is challenged by skills gaps, high costs and shadow AI. That’s the headline finding of our latest survey of over 900 IT leaders and AI engineers in nine countries 1. According to the survey AI is a core strategic priority for 72% 2 of organizations in Europe, the Middle East, and Africa, and they have plans to increase their AI investments by an average of 32% by 2026 3. The focus on AI is clear, yet the data also reveals a stark gap between ambition and reality: only 7% of organisations report “driving customer value” at scale from their AI investments today 4. This is a crucial challenge for leaders who need to translate significant investment into tangible business outcomes. So what is preventing organisations moving from small-scale pilots to enterprise-wide value? Tackling the barriers to scale AI Our survey data outlines the extent of the talent shortage faced, with 70% of respondents agreeing there is an urgent AI skills gap 3. The most significant gaps cited by those respondents are in the practical application of AI, such as connecting AI to enterprise data (49%), and making efficient use of AI capabilities (48%). Nearly as many (47%) report difficulty educating the business to use AI effectively, which complicates organisation-wide adoption. As the role of AI in the workplace is established, another layer of complexity emerges. ‘Shadow AI’, the use of unsanctioned AI tools by employees, is becoming a significant challenge to effective governance and scalable adoption. The vast majority of responding EMEA organisations (91% 5 ) admit their organisation is experiencing a shadow AI problem. This should serve as a wake-up call: AI is being adopted with or without IT teams’ authorisation.</description></item><item><title>Simplify your cloud-native transition with Oracle WebLogic Server on Red Hat OpenShift Virtualization</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-10-09-simplify-your-cloud-native-transition-with-oracle-weblogic-server-on-red-hat-ope/</link><pubDate>Thu, 09 Oct 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-10-09-simplify-your-cloud-native-transition-with-oracle-weblogic-server-on-red-hat-ope/</guid><description>Simplify your cloud-native transition with Oracle WebLogic Server on Red Hat OpenShift Virtualization Collaboration for greater flexibility The power of a unified platform Red Hat Learning Subscription | Product Trial About the authors Mark Longwell Rob McManus Ju Lim More like this Blog post Blog post Keep exploring Browse by channel Automation Artificial intelligence Open hybrid cloud Security Edge computing Infrastructure Applications Virtualization Share Organizations today are under increasing pressure to modernize critical applications while maintaining the reliability, security, and performance of their existing IT investments. Many business-critical workloads, including financial systems and telecommunications services, run on Oracle WebLogic Server. At the same time, organizations are embracing cloud-native platforms like Red Hat OpenShift to gain the agility, scalability, and consistency needed in hybrid and multicloud cloud environments. Working with the Oracle WebLogic team, Oracle&amp;rsquo;s validation of WebLogic Server on Red Hat OpenShift Virtualization allows your organization to leverage current investments as you move to fully containerized workloads. In addition, Oracle also supports WebLogic Server on Red Hat OpenShift. Oracle has validated WebLogic Server on Red Hat OpenShift Virtualization , enabling organizations to modernize applications by bridging existing investments with cloud-native environments. This validation, alongside support for WebLogic Server on Red Hat OpenShift , empowers you to consolidate your infrastructure and manage both virtual machines and containers on a unified platform. Red Hat&amp;rsquo;s collaboration with Oracle provides the ability to run your existing WebLogic Server workload in a virtual machine (VM) while taking advantage of OpenShift&amp;rsquo;s Kubernetes-based foundation (highlighted in Gartner&amp;rsquo;s 2025 Magic Quadrant for Container Management for the third year in a row). Organizations can consolidate infrastructure by managing both VMs and containers through a common cloud-native platform. This reduces operational complexity, streamlines management, and accelerates time-to-market for new services. For IT leaders, this means they can continue to leverage their WebLogic investments without rewriting applications. Development teams gain a pathway to modernize applications gradually, shifting from virtualized workloads to microservices and containers at their own pace.</description></item><item><title>VCF Breakroom Chats Episode 63 – No Experience Needed:  Demystifying Kubernetes for Aspiring Cloud Admins with VCF 9.0</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-10-08-vcf-breakroom-chats-episode-63-no-experience-needed-demystifying-kubernetes-for-/</link><pubDate>Wed, 08 Oct 2025 18:11:12 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-10-08-vcf-breakroom-chats-episode-63-no-experience-needed-demystifying-kubernetes-for-/</guid><description>VCF Breakroom Chats Episode 63 About the VCF Breakroom Chat Series Discover more from VMware Cloud Foundation (VCF) Blog Related Articles VCF Breakroom Chats Episode 63 - No Experience Needed: Demystifying Kubernetes for Aspiring Cloud Admins with VCF 9.0 Analyst Insight Series: VMware Cloud Foundation Update - A RedMonk Conversation VCF Breakroom Chats Episode 62: Cloud Governance Unlocked - From VI Admin to Cloud Policy Pro with VCF 9.0 Welcome to the next episode of the VCF Breakroom Chats.

A common occurrence for a typical telecommunication (telco) service provider. Millions of subscribers are streaming videos, playing games, and making calls. Suddenly, a network outage occurs in a key metropolitan area. Level 3 (L3) operations team at the service provider would begin troubleshooting the incident. They would manually sift through logs across multiple domains (radio access network, core, transport) and race against time to restore services. Hours, sometimes days, could pass before the incident was fully resolved, leading to frustrated customers, lost revenue, and reputational damage. How different would the situation have been if artificial intelligence (AI) was involved? An agentic AI-driven network would detect anomalies in real time, identifying the root cause and resolving the issue autonomously before customers even noticed a problem. Operations teams would be able to move from a reactive posture to a proactive one, focusing instead on strategic innovation and customer experience. Building AI-driven autonomous intelligent networks The telco industry is at a pivotal moment. With 5G fully deployed, and 5G advanced and 6G on the horizon, networks are more complex and data-intensive than ever. Manual approaches to network deployment and operations simply cannot keep up with the scale of current and future demand.</description></item><item><title>The MLOps Challenge: Scaling from one model to thousands</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-10-08-the-mlops-challenge-scaling-from-one-model-to-thousands/</link><pubDate>Wed, 08 Oct 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-10-08-the-mlops-challenge-scaling-from-one-model-to-thousands/</guid><description>The MLOps Challenge: Scaling from one model to thousands What if managing models didn’t have to be chaotic? How to put this into practice An example in practice From chaos to control The adaptable enterprise: Why AI readiness is disruption readiness About the authors Robert Lundberg Cansu Kavili Oernek More like this Blog post Blog post Original podcast Original podcast Keep exploring Browse by channel Automation Artificial intelligence Open hybrid cloud Security Edge computing Infrastructure Applications Virtualization Share Taking a single AI model from idea to production is already a journey. You need to gather data, build and train the model, deploy it, and keep it running. That alone is challenging, but still manageable. This is where MLOps comes in: applying automation and best practices so the process is reliable and repeatable. But what happens when one model becomes a thousand? The artisanal, one-off approach that worked for a single model quickly collapses—retraining by hand becomes unsustainable, deployments drift out of sync, lineage and auditability are lost, and security gaps can appear. The good news: managing large numbers of AI models doesn’t have to be chaos. Start looking at it as a system, as an automated factory for AI , and scale will start working for you. Scaling AI doesn’t have to feel overwhelming. Instead of treating each model as a one-off project, think of them as part of a well-managed system. Imagine an assembly line where: Adding a new model is as simple as adding a new configuration file. Retraining happens automatically whenever fresh data arrives—no more manual babysitting. Security checks, scans, and signatures are baked into the process, like quality control in modern software delivery.</description></item><item><title>What’s new in Red Hat Ansible Automation Platform 2.6</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-10-08-what-s-new-in-red-hat-ansible-automation-platform-2-6/</link><pubDate>Wed, 08 Oct 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-10-08-what-s-new-in-red-hat-ansible-automation-platform-2-6/</guid><description>What’s new in Red Hat Ansible Automation Platform 2.6 Unlock more value: Monitor, measure, and report on the impact of your automation Demonstrate value and measure ROI Make smarter, data-driven decisions Optimize and right-size your automation Report and share your data with enhanced security Operate more efficiently: Accelerate your IT operations with generative AI Achieve new levels of scale: Enable automation across the enterprise Unlock wider automation adoption Empower admins to share automation Simplify service delivery Self-service automation portal from two user perspectives Additional platform enhancements in AAP 2.6 Event-driven Ansible Refreshed user interface AI-assisted inventory generation (developer preview) Strategic integrations and new content The time to upgrade is now Next steps and resources Red Hat Ansible Automation Platform | Product Trial About the author Justin Braun More like this Blog post Blog post Original podcast Original podcast Keep exploring Browse by channel Automation Artificial intelligence Open hybrid cloud Security Edge computing Infrastructure Applications Virtualization Share Red Hat Ansible Automation Platform (AAP) 2.6 is now generally available, delivering new capabilities, platform enhancements, and strategic integrations to help you build resilient and trusted foundations for the next generation of IT operations, because you aren&amp;rsquo;t just preparing for the future — you are automating for it.

The new front door is an API How Red Hat and F5 work together Build faster, stay protected Red Hat Product Security About the author Shane Heroux More like this Blog post Blog post Original podcast Original podcast Keep exploring Browse by channel Automation Artificial intelligence Open hybrid cloud Security Edge computing Infrastructure Applications Virtualization Share You’ve trained the model, packaged it on Red Hat OpenShift AI, and it’s ready to work. The next move is exposing it through an API so people and applications can use it. At that moment, your model stops being an internal experiment and becomes a front-door service. And like any front door, somebody is going to knock … sometimes it’s the right user, sometimes not. Your model is no longer just a project in a lab: it’s a production endpoint. And like any endpoint, it’s a target. How do you ensure that only the right applications and users are interacting with it? How do you protect the sensitive data it might be trained on or the proprietary logic it contains? Every API endpoint is a target. For AI models, the attack surface is bigger than a simple app service. Beyond simple denial-of-service traffic, models can be tricked into leaking data through prompt injection, or probed until sensitive training data shows up. Even when no data leaks, attackers may try to hijack compute cycles or scrape responses in bulk. As deployments spread across clouds, datacenters, and edge sites, these risks multiply.</description></item><item><title>Announcing GPU Droplets accelerated by NVIDIA HGX H100 in the EU</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-10-07-announcing-gpu-droplets-accelerated-by-nvidia-hgx-h100-in-the-eu/</link><pubDate>Tue, 07 Oct 2025 20:57:57 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-10-07-announcing-gpu-droplets-accelerated-by-nvidia-hgx-h100-in-the-eu/</guid><description>Announcing GPU Droplets accelerated by NVIDIA HGX H100 in the EU Accelerating training workloads with NVIDIA HGX H100s and DigitalOcean âWe have two terabytes of RAM on each of the nodes, which we leverage to train larger models.

Enterprises are blending AI capabilities with enterprise data to deliver better outcomes for employees, customers, and partners. But as organizations weave AI deeper into their systems, that data and infrastructure also become more attractive targets for cybercriminals and other adversaries. Generative AI (gen AI), in particular, introduces new risks by significantly expanding an organization’s attack surface. That means enterprises must carefully evaluate potential threats, vulnerabilities, and the risks they bring to business operations. Deploying AI with a strong security posture, in compliance with regulations, and in a way that is more trustworthy requires more than patchwork defenses, it demands a strategic shift. Security can’t be an afterthought—it must be built into the entire AI strategy. AI security and AI safety are related but distinct concepts. Both are necessary to reduce risk, but they address different challenges. AI security focuses on protecting the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of AI systems. The goal is to prevent malicious actors from attacking or manipulating those systems.</description></item><item><title>Red Hat OpenStack VMware Migration toolkit deep-dive</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-10-07-red-hat-openstack-vmware-migration-toolkit-deep-dive/</link><pubDate>Tue, 07 Oct 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-10-07-red-hat-openstack-vmware-migration-toolkit-deep-dive/</guid><description>Red Hat OpenStack VMware Migration toolkit deep-dive Highlights Ansible Integration with Ansible Automation Platform OpenStack APIs and Changed Block Tracking (CBT) for Warm Migration Infrastructure Components in the Migration Process Migration Workflow Overview Red Hat Ansible Automation Platform | Product Trial About the author Pedro Navarro Pérez More like this Blog post Blog post Keep exploring Browse by channel Automation Artificial intelligence Open hybrid cloud Security Edge computing Infrastructure Applications Virtualization Share When an organization currently on VMware evaluates transitioning to a new cloud platform, such as Red Hat OpenStack Services on OpenShift , a key initial concern is typically the effective migration of VMware virtual machine workloads.

Why Care? Why Now The Nirmata Value Looking Ahead Over the past decade, cloud-native technologies and Kubernetes have become the foundation for how enterprises build and run software. At the same time, artificial intelligence (AI) has catapulted from experimentation to mainstream adoption. This convergence is reshaping not only how applications are created but also how they are implemented, secured, and governed. As the creators of Kyverno , the leading open-source policy-as-code engine for Kubernetes, we’ve seen firsthand how organizations use policies to define intent, enforce standards, and manage risk. Kyverno excels at surfacing issues and helping teams understand where their guardrails may be failing. But detection alone isn’t enough. Teams are still left with the burden of figuring out how to remediate issues, apply fixes across environments, and maintain compliance at scale. This is why platform engineering has become both the bottleneck and the enabler of the AI future. Without scalable governance and guardrails, platform engineering slows down innovation. But with AI-driven governance and automated policy enforcement , platform engineering becomes the discipline that unlocks velocity, resilience, and trust—creating the foundation AI needs to thrive. The question is no longer IF we need governance, but how we can establish effective guardrails, controls, and compliance without slowing down innovation. That’s where AI-driven governance comes in.</description></item><item><title>Introducing Headlamp Plugin for Karpenter - Scaling and Visibility</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-10-06-introducing-headlamp-plugin-for-karpenter-scaling-and-visibility/</link><pubDate>Mon, 06 Oct 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-10-06-introducing-headlamp-plugin-for-karpenter-scaling-and-visibility/</guid><description>Introducing Headlamp Plugin for Karpenter - Scaling and Visibility Map view of Karpenter Resources and how they relate to Kubernetes resources Visualization of Karpenter Metrics Scaling decisions Config editor with validation support Real time view of Karpenter resources Dashboard for Pending Pods Karpenter Providers How to use Feedback and Questions Headlamp is an open‑source, extensible Kubernetes SIG UI project designed to let you explore, manage, and debug cluster resources.

However, poorly designed AI solutions can lead to misplaced trust, misinformation, and ethical lapses, as evidenced by several high-profile failures. Air Canada&amp;rsquo;s chatbot once misled a grieving passenger with inaccurate refund advice , resulting in a tribunal ruling that held the airline accountable for the AI&amp;rsquo;s errors and underscoring the legal risks of unchecked automation. Microsoft&amp;rsquo;s Bing AI, dubbed Sydney , veered into threatening and manipulative behavior during conversations, attempting to undermine users&amp;rsquo; personal relationships and highlighting the psychological dangers of unmoderated AI personas. The Zillow Offers home-flipping business was terminated after the AI algorithm unintentionally purchased homes at higher prices than its current estimates of future selling prices, resulting in a $304 million inventory write-down, and a workforce reduction of 2000 employees. Based on the failures mentioned, it&amp;rsquo;s clear that simply deploying AI is not enough. To achieve a positive outcome and avoid costly errors, the deliberate design and implementation of human-AI collaboration is essential. An approach that includes human planning, interaction, and oversight is critical for positive results. AI agents are also a hot topic—semi-autonomous AI agents that can notice “things” happening around them, make choices on their own, and work toward goals without needing constant human help. This means the ways people team up with AI are changing and growing more varied. We need a clear way to organize these teamwork styles, based on factors like how humans and AI connect, and on the different ways AI helps with decisions. With factors like those in mind, we can place people in the right roles, helping to keep things fair, avoid problems like AI interaction degrading over time, and create a human-AI partnership where both sides help each other.</description></item><item><title>Evolving our ServiceNow integration: Sunsetting the Notification Service for more capable alternatives</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-10-03-evolving-our-servicenow-integration-sunsetting-the-notification-service-for-more/</link><pubDate>Fri, 03 Oct 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-10-03-evolving-our-servicenow-integration-sunsetting-the-notification-service-for-more/</guid><description>Evolving our ServiceNow integration: Sunsetting the Notification Service for more capable alternatives From simplicity to capability and flexibility New, more powerful integration options Option A: Script-based integration with Business Rules (pro-code option) Option B: Integration with Flow Designer (low-code option) Option C: Request-based automation with the Ansible spoke (request-driven option) Key deprecation dates What does this mean for you? Red Hat Ansible Automation Platform | Product Trial About the author Steve Fulmer More like this Blog post Blog post Original podcast Original podcast Keep exploring Browse by channel Automation Artificial intelligence Open hybrid cloud Security Edge computing Infrastructure Applications Virtualization Share At Red Hat, our goal is to provide enterprise-grade automation solutions that evolve with your needs. As part of this commitment, we are deprecating the Red Hat ServiceNow Notification Service application from the ServiceNow Store. This isn&amp;rsquo;t a reduction in capability; it&amp;rsquo;s an evolution. We&amp;rsquo;re moving away from a simplified, one-size-fits-all application to more robust and modern integration patterns that offer the capabilities required by enterprise IT environments. The Red Hat ServiceNow Notification Service application was designed for simplicity, providing a straightforward way to send the entire ServiceNow record as a JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) payload to Event-Driven Ansible. In the past, the application was required to integrate ServiceNow with Event-Driven Ansible. While it served as an effective entry point for using ServiceNow with Event-Driven Ansible, our customers&amp;rsquo; automation needs have matured. Today, more control over data, more complex triggering logic, and more targeted, request-driven automation is required. To better serve the advanced requirements of our customers, we are standardizing on 3 different fully supported integration pathways for ServiceNow and Event-Driven Ansible. Customers should use 1 of 3 more capable and flexible integration methods. These options enable customized payloads, enrich event data, and build sophisticated workflows that organizations demand. All of these integration options are fully supported by ServiceNow, taking advantage of standard ServiceNow capabilities.</description></item><item><title>Friday Five — October 3, 2025</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-10-03-friday-five-october-3-2025/</link><pubDate>Fri, 03 Oct 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-10-03-friday-five-october-3-2025/</guid><description>Friday Five — October 3, 2025 Red Hat Summit 2026 call for proposals is now open Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) on AWS Cloud Marketplace trial is now live What you don’t see could cost you: Why open source matters in enterprise AI Hitachi Vantara Collaborates with Red Hat to Accelerate Hybrid Cloud Transformation and Modernize Legacy Virtualization SiliconANGLE - Private AI takes root as enterprises demand open source consistency About the author Red Hat Corporate Communications More like this Blog post Blog post Original podcast Original podcast Keep exploring Browse by channel Automation Artificial intelligence Open hybrid cloud Security Edge computing Infrastructure Applications Virtualization Share Red Hat Summit is coming to Atlanta, Georgia and we&amp;rsquo;re looking for our community of experts—customers, partners, and associates—to share their knowledge and experiences.

This new account layerâwe call it Organizationsâis perfect for teams that need scalable structure without the massive, complex overhead of traditional enterprise cloud providers. Organizations was built to simplify account management for DigitalOcean customers who manage multiple teams and users. Weâve heard from our growing customers, agencies, partners, and enterprises that managing multiple teams, separate bills, and fragmented user access is a pain. With this new organization layer, you can better organize your teamâs access even as you scale up. Before today, every Team on DigitalOcean was treated as its own separate account. If you managed five different clients, five different projects, or five internal departments, that meant five separate bills, five different places to manage user access, and a fragmented view of your overall cloud presence. Our new account layer closes this gap by allowing you to consolidate multiple teams under one Organization, providing the centralized control and simplified operations needed by growing enterprises. By unifying your entire DigitalOcean presence into a single group, so you can streamline operations, gain more financial control, and build a cohesive environment that scales seamlessly.</description></item><item><title>Storage that thinks for itself: Introducing Storage autoscaling, the newest feature for Managed Databases</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-10-02-storage-that-thinks-for-itself-introducing-storage-autoscaling-the-newest-featur/</link><pubDate>Thu, 02 Oct 2025 08:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-10-02-storage-that-thinks-for-itself-introducing-storage-autoscaling-the-newest-featur/</guid><description>Storage that thinks for itself: Introducing Storage autoscaling, the newest feature for Managed Databases How it works: your database, but smarter How Storage autoscaling helps you 1.

As the number of systems grows, configurations drift, maintenance becomes repetitive, and updates can quickly turn into a headache. At Red Hat, we support your standardization journey by providing you with what you need to deliver a robust, coherent, and integrated solution for your standard operating environment. In this post, I explore the key areas you should take into account along your standardization journey, and how these can be simplified using Red Hat technologies, products, and services. Over time, daily activities on systems can lead to configuration drifts, issues with running workloads and a potential exposure to threats. The best way to start a standardization journey is to have a consistent baseline that your whole infrastructure can rely on, whether it&amp;rsquo;s on bare metal, hypervisors, or the cloud. Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) offers two different ways to start building installation images that are hardened, pre-configured with the tools you need, and most of all, that are repeatable over time. Included in RHEL, and also available in the Red Hat Insights service, image builder allows you to define a blueprint of an operating system image. Your image can contain as many customizations as you need, including users, firewall rules, repositories, and which packages to include. You can apply security profiles to harden your image, and much more. Image builder can generate installation media (such as an ISO, cloud provider image, hypervisor image, and so on) that can be deployed on-premises, in the cloud, or at the edge. Based on the open source bootc project , image mode introduces a new way to build and manage RHEL systems at scale.</description></item><item><title>Red Hat and Sylva unify the future for telco cloud</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-10-02-red-hat-and-sylva-unify-the-future-for-telco-cloud/</link><pubDate>Thu, 02 Oct 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-10-02-red-hat-and-sylva-unify-the-future-for-telco-cloud/</guid><description>Red Hat and Sylva unify the future for telco cloud About the author Rich Stephens More like this Blog post Blog post Original podcast Original podcast Browse by channel Automation Artificial intelligence Open hybrid cloud Security Edge computing Infrastructure Applications Virtualization Share The telecommunications service provider landscape continues to be rewritten with the coming of 5G Advanced, edge computing, automation, and AI. But realizing their full potential demands a continued shift in infrastructure for service providers to be more agile and efficient. Cloud-native architectures and open source principles have emerged as the path forward, offering the flexibility and speed needed to differentiate from offering pure connectivity. Yet, a significant challenge of fragmentation persists thanks to complex islands of legacy infrastructure and technical debt that have built up over the years. For service providers, this involves managing multiple stacks and skill sets. For vendors, it means costly, time-consuming certifications against numerous platforms. The industry is looking for ways to reduce operational costs, speed up service rollouts to drive new revenue, and capitalize on the full agility that cloud-native technologies and methodologies promise. Introducing Sylva Sylva is an open source project initiated by five of Europe’s largest service providers, Orange, Deutsche Telekom, Vodafone, Telefónica, and Telecom Italia, along with network providers Ericsson and Nokia, and has expanded to include many more participants. Its objective is to release a cloud software framework tailored for telco and edge requirements and a reference implementation and validation program to implement it. By converging the cloud layer around open source components with Kubernetes at its core, Sylva eliminates fragmentation. It establishes a single, validated foundation upon which network functions can be certified once and run anywhere, reducing complexity and unlocking the operational agility service providers desperately need. This “develop once, deploy anywhere” model is Red Hat’s core proposition and our hybrid cloud platforms align directly with the goals of Sylva.</description></item><item><title>Red Hat Learning Subscription: Expert chat for premium and standard users</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-10-02-red-hat-learning-subscription-expert-chat-for-premium-and-standard-users/</link><pubDate>Thu, 02 Oct 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-10-02-red-hat-learning-subscription-expert-chat-for-premium-and-standard-users/</guid><description>Red Hat Learning Subscription: Expert chat for premium and standard users Red Hat Learning Subscription | Product Trial About the author Mary Margaret Barnes More like this Blog post Blog post Original podcast Keep exploring Browse by channel Automation Artificial intelligence Open hybrid cloud Security Edge computing Infrastructure Applications Virtualization Share What if your self-paced training came with a live, 1-on-1 conversation with a Red Hat expert?

Why do I need Kyverno if Kubernetes already has policies? With the addition of ValidatingAdmissionPolicy and MutatingAdmissionPolicy in Kubernetes, do you still need Kyverno? TL;DR: Yes, you still need Kyverno for applying policies on existing resources, complex logic, reporting, testing, and off-cluster / shift-left use cases! Read on for details: Prior to Kyverno, policy management in Kubernetes was complex and cumbersome. While the need for Policy as Code was clear, initial implementations required learning complex languages and did not implement the full policy as code lifecycle.</description></item><item><title>VMware Cloud Foundation Automation -Infrastructure Resource Policy Overview</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-10-01-vmware-cloud-foundation-automation-infrastructure-resource-policy-overview/</link><pubDate>Wed, 01 Oct 2025 17:41:23 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-10-01-vmware-cloud-foundation-automation-infrastructure-resource-policy-overview/</guid><description>Related Articles VMware Cloud Foundation Automation -Infrastructure Resource Policy Overview Set Your Implementation Up for Success with VCF Jumpstart Workshop VCF Breakroom Chats Episode 60: Infrastructure Modernization, Health, and APIs for Private Cloud With the release of VMware Cloud Foundation 9.0, we introduced a number of new and exciting features and capabilities to help our customers deliver an agile, performant, and secure self-service private cloud. As part of a private cloud strategy, providing a way to consume the underlying infrastructure services and deliver applications quickly all the while managing governance is crucial. With VMware Cloud Foundation (VCF), a number of cloud services are available for consumption, such as VM and Kubernetes Cluster services, along with services for database management, continuous delivery pipelines, service mesh, image registry, and much much more. This blog is an overview of some of the core services like VM and Kubernetes services along with how to apply IaaS resource policies to them. Resource policies help ensure configurations such as cluster sizes are compliant. Security postures such as enforcing a baseline pod security level, and disallowing resources to be deployed, are just a few examples of how to use resource policies. Choice of Consumption Models With VCF, Organization Admins can choose how to isolate users and resources using constructs such as Organizations (tenants), Projects, namespaces, etc. Consumers, such as developers and app teams, also have choice in how they want to consume. The graphic below shows two primary methods: Self-Service Catalog and UI/CLI. Single Platform for Building and Managing Apps VMware Cloud Foundation is a single platform for building and managing applications and services for the entire Organization (tenants). IT teams can run and manage diverse workloads, including AI/ML and cloud native applications. Teams can use a modern interface (UI + code) to facilitate the deployment of services such as databases and VMs.</description></item><item><title>Llama Stack and the case for an open “run-anywhere” contract for agents</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-10-01-llama-stack-and-the-case-for-an-open-run-anywhere-contract-for-agents/</link><pubDate>Wed, 01 Oct 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-10-01-llama-stack-and-the-case-for-an-open-run-anywhere-contract-for-agents/</guid><description>Llama Stack and the case for an open “run-anywhere” contract for agents The 4 layers of Llama Stack 1.

This is the question we get asked most often. It’s a fair one—after all, those frameworks already give developers rich tooling for retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and agents. But we see Llama Stack as more than “another agent framework. ” It’s better understood as four distinct layers: A familiar surface for building agents. Here it overlaps with LangChain, LangFlow, and CrewAI. Developers can author agents using common abstractions.

The upcoming update to the National Digital and AI Strategy in 2025 reflects a continued commitment to innovation, not just for economic competitiveness, but for better, more responsive public services. To sustain this progress and ensure impact across the economy and society, Irish organisations – particularly in the public sector – will need to take a pragmatic, outcome-led approach to AI adoption. One that prioritises strategic digital skills, cross-sector collaboration, and AI solutions that are scalable and energy-efficient. Recent Red Hat research shows that nearly all IT managers in Ireland plan to increase investment in both cloud (93%) and AI (95%) this year. The intent is clear. But the challenge is now delivery: how to turn national ambition into measurable outcome, so that all areas of Irish industry can develop an AI toolbox fit for purpose. This is pressing in sectors like healthcare, agriculture and planning, where digital transformation is essential to improving public services, managing environmental resources and addressing infrastructure demands in a growing population. Ireland’s AI use is growing - its application across enterprises grew from 8% in 2023 to 14% in 2024. Laying the foundations for connected AI One of the biggest barriers to delivering progress with AI is structural. Ireland’s public sector is under pressure to improve the speed and quality of service delivery, often while maintaining or modernising legacy systems. Teams are expected to adopt new technologies, collaborate more effectively and respond to rapidly changing citizen expectations.</description></item><item><title>Optimizing application architectures for AI: From monoliths to intelligent agents (2 of 2 blogs series)</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-09-30-optimizing-application-architectures-for-ai-from-monoliths-to-intelligent-agents/</link><pubDate>Tue, 30 Sep 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-09-30-optimizing-application-architectures-for-ai-from-monoliths-to-intelligent-agents/</guid><description>Optimizing application architectures for AI: From monoliths to intelligent agents (2 of 2 blogs series) Why does current customer support fall short?

Whether it’s a chatbot or a complex application, the principle is the same: if the nervous system falters, everything else does too. As we know, however, a nervous system doesn&amp;rsquo;t operate in isolation. It relies on the rest of the body, with countless other systems working in harmony. Enterprise AI is fundamentally the same. Individual models, isolated infrastructure components, fragmented orchestration, or disconnected applications cannot deliver meaningful value on their own. Real impact only comes when these elements connect to form a cohesive, high-performing whole. There are many paths to AI adoption. Some begin with closed, so-called “black-box” systems: pre-packaged platforms that make it simple to get up and running. They can be a great entry point, but they also come with trade-offs. When you cannot see how a model was trained, it can be difficult to explain its behavior, address bias, or verify accuracy in your context. In fact, a 2025 IBM survey found that 45% of business leaders cite data accuracy or bias as their biggest obstacle to adopting AI.</description></item><item><title>VCF Breakroom Chats Episode 60: Infrastructure Modernization, Health, and APIs for Private Cloud</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-09-29-vcf-breakroom-chats-episode-60-infrastructure-modernization-health-and-apis-for-/</link><pubDate>Mon, 29 Sep 2025 20:39:22 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-09-29-vcf-breakroom-chats-episode-60-infrastructure-modernization-health-and-apis-for-/</guid><description>Related Articles VCF Breakroom Chats Episode 60: Infrastructure Modernization, Health, and APIs for Private Cloud Empowering Platform Engineers with native Kubernetes Multi-Cluster Management in VMware Cloud Foundation VCF Breakroom Chats Episode 61: From VI Admin to Cloud Hero - Building a Multi-Tenant Cloud with VCF 9.0 Are you looking to improve the health visibility and scale of your private cloud deployment?

This groundbreaking release introduces native K8s multi-cluster management capabilities in VCF accessed through the VCF Automation consumption experience. It’s specifically designed to address the complex challenges that platform engineers face when orchestrating K8s workloads across distributed environments. This capability provides platform engineers with control over their K8s environments, while maintaining the simplicity and operational consistency they need. Its new K8s multi-cluster management capabilities complement built-in private cloud services (VM, vSphere Kubernetes Service (VKS) (K8s runtime), Network, Volume, VM Image) that allow engineers to provision VMs and VKS clusters as K8s objects using K8s manifests. Engineers can use the cloud services and Infrastructure as Code to create version-controlled blueprints (e. g. , for provisioning VKS clusters and deploying applications on them) publishable to a self-service catalog for developers. Together the new native K8s multi-cluster management and cloud services allow organizations to run their entire application portfolio and manage the underlying K8s infrastructure on a single, streamlined platform. Platform engineers face an increasingly complex landscape managing K8s infrastructure due to the exponential growth of containerized applications. Traditional approaches can’t accommodate the operational challenges of modern K8s deployments, which often involve numerous clusters and multiple software elements across various environments. This complexity, compounded by K8s dynamic nature, makes maintaining visibility difficult.</description></item><item><title>Hacktoberfest 2025: How to Participate</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-09-29-hacktoberfest-2025-how-to-participate/</link><pubDate>Mon, 29 Sep 2025 07:06:22 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-09-29-hacktoberfest-2025-how-to-participate/</guid><description>Hacktoberfest 2025: How to Participate Hacktoberfest 2025: How to Participate About the author Try DigitalOcean for free Related Articles Hacktoberfest 2025: Celebrate All Things Open Source!

Red Hat OpenShift Virtualization combined with Palo Alto Networks VM-Series software firewalls helps address these complexities where they typically arise. OpenShift Virtualization streamlines the modernization and lifecycle management of VM-based workloads within a Kubernetes-native platform. VM-Series complements this by bringing consistent, application-aware network security to virtualized environments, helping teams enforce policy and maintain visibility even as infrastructure evolves. Additionally, Red Hat OpenShift integrated with Prisma AIRS™ enables customers to deploy AI-powered threat prevention for runtime network protection across containerized workloads running on OpenShift clusters. Many enterprises operate in hybrid environments by necessity, not choice. Existing virtualization investments coexist with containerized applications, and teams are expected to support both with equal reliability. The operational challenge is not only bridging these domains but doing so without fragmenting security policy, tooling, or visibility. Today, workloads migrate between private clouds, public clouds, or across datacenters and have different form factors of the workload including physical, virtual, and containerized. While this provides significant flexibility to the customers, it compounds the issue of enforcing uniform security posture, and migrations become moments of risk. Policy gaps, inconsistent segmentation, or east-west blind spots can create undetected lateral movement paths for threats.</description></item><item><title>Managing Red Hat Device Edge: Tools and strategies</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-09-29-managing-red-hat-device-edge-tools-and-strategies/</link><pubDate>Mon, 29 Sep 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-09-29-managing-red-hat-device-edge-tools-and-strategies/</guid><description>Managing Red Hat Device Edge: Tools and strategies Managing Red Hat Device Edge: Red Hat tools and strategies Package-based Red Hat Device Edge system management: The traditional approach Image-based Red Hat Device Edge system management: The modern approach Conclusion: The right tool for the right job Hatville: miniature city where edge computing comes to life About the author Luis Arizmendi More like this Blog post Blog post Original podcast Original podcast Keep exploring Browse by channel Automation Artificial intelligence Open hybrid cloud Security Edge computing Infrastructure Applications Virtualization Share Aligning system management, automation, and application lifecycle with your edge strategy In part 1 of this two-part blog series, we introduced the decision framework for Red Hat Device Edge , when it makes sense compared to Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) or Red Hat OpenShift , and the unique role of MicroShift in enabling Kubernetes at the edge. In this article, you’ll learn how to manage the system that you’ve chosen for your edge strategy. Once you’ve selected Red Hat Device Edge, the next step is designing a management approach that matches your deployment model, team expertise, and operational requirements. We’ll explore: The trade-offs between package-based and image-based Red Hat Device Edge deployments. How Red Hat Satellite, Red Hat Ansible Automation Platform, and Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management for Kubernetes fit into the picture. The future of large-scale image-based management with Red Hat Edge Manager. Application lifecycle management options for MicroShift in both package-based and image-based environments. By the end of this article, you’ll have a clear understanding of the management strategies available for Red Hat Device Edge and how to align them with your edge computing goals. Red Hat Device Edge is built with RHEL, allowing you to confidently take advantage of familiar management tools. The primary differentiator is MicroShift support, which introduces additional considerations for container orchestration alongside traditional system management. Red Hat provides several products for scale management, but the optimal selection depends on your deployment approach, particularly whether you choose package-based or image-based RHEL deployments (both are supported with Red Hat Device Edge). The choice between using package-based or image-based (bootc) RHEL is a topic of its own and falls outside the scope of this article.</description></item><item><title>Migrating to Red Hat OpenShift Virtualization with NetApp FlexPod</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-09-29-migrating-to-red-hat-openshift-virtualization-with-netapp-flexpod/</link><pubDate>Mon, 29 Sep 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-09-29-migrating-to-red-hat-openshift-virtualization-with-netapp-flexpod/</guid><description>Migrating to Red Hat OpenShift Virtualization with NetApp FlexPod Current challenges A unified platform Why persistent storage is essential Red Hat OpenShift Virtualization and NetApp: The unified foundation FlexPod, a design from NetApp validated by Cisco NetApp: Comprehensive storage solutions for the enterprise Dynamic storage provisioning with NetApp Trident Versatile protocol support and storage drivers Seamless integration with Red Hat OpenShift Service on AWS (ROSA) Facilitating VM migration Data protection and disaster recovery for business continuity Flexible snapshots and backups Key takeaways 15 reasons to adopt Red Hat OpenShift Virtualization About the authors George James Banu Sundhar More like this Blog post Blog post Keep exploring Browse by channel Automation Artificial intelligence Open hybrid cloud Security Edge computing Infrastructure Applications Virtualization Share The path to virtualization started decades ago. Early efforts with mainframes in the 1960s allowed multiple operating systems to run on the same hardware. In the late 1990s, the virtualization of x86 hardware was introduced, and reshaped the way organizations deployed, managed, and scaled IT infrastructure. Applications were no longer bound to a single server. They could be moved at will, and even scaled to meet demand. Entire businesses and careers have been built on what we now know as traditional virtualization. And even as public cloud computing has become more accessible, traditional virtualization continues to evolve and will be with us for some time. Gartner projects that “70% of x86 datacenter workloads will continue to use hypervisor-based virtualization through 2027” Even highly effective traditions must evolve to meet changing needs. Today, organizations face pressures that are forcing them to reassess long-standing virtualization strategies, including: Changes in market pricing: Recent changes to licensing and increased prices has many organizations exploring more cost-effective alternatives. The rise of cloud-native development: Modern application development is moving towards a microservices architecture, where applications are split into small, independent components. Containers are the widely accepted standard for this approach. Many businesses are looking for ways to adopt these modern development practices without abandoning existing infrastructure.</description></item><item><title>Red Hat Device Edge: Decision framework</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-09-29-red-hat-device-edge-decision-framework/</link><pubDate>Mon, 29 Sep 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-09-29-red-hat-device-edge-decision-framework/</guid><description>Red Hat Device Edge: Decision framework What makes Red Hat Device Edge special?

Whether you&amp;rsquo;re planning your first edge deployment or optimizing an existing infrastructure, we’ll help you evaluate where Red Hat Device Edge fits into your strategy. This is a big topic, so we’re breaking it into 2 parts: Part 1 (this post): A decision framework to help you figure out when Red Hat Device Edge makes sense, how it stacks up against RHEL and Red Hat OpenShift, and where MicroShift fits in edge environments. Part 2 : An in-depth look into management strategies for Red Hat Device Edge—from package-based vs. image-based deployments to automation tools and how Red Hat Edge Manager is changing the game. At the end of this series, you’ll have a clear framework for making informed decisions about Red Hat Device Edge adoption and feel prepared to effectively manage it. Red Hat Device Edge might sound like a completely new product, but here&amp;rsquo;s the interesting part: it&amp;rsquo;s actually RHEL with a twist. Red Hat Device Edge binaries are identical to RHEL, but Red Hat Device Edge adds subscription-level differences and support entitlements. In other words, there&amp;rsquo;s no technical difference between Red Hat Device Edge and RHEL; the magic lies in the subscription packaging and pricing strategy designed specifically for edge computing scenarios.</description></item><item><title>Simplify virtualization deployments with the Assisted Installer</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-09-29-simplify-virtualization-deployments-with-the-assisted-installer/</link><pubDate>Mon, 29 Sep 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-09-29-simplify-virtualization-deployments-with-the-assisted-installer/</guid><description>Simplify virtualization deployments with the Assisted Installer What is the Assisted Installer?

Tom Kivlin, Principal Cloud Architect at Vodafone, recently shared insights into their journey, highlighting the challenges overcome and the benefits realized through this strategic approach. He spoke at OpenShift Commons in London earlier this year. Traditional telecommunication service provider environments tend to operate at a slower pace compared to the rapid release cycles of Kubernetes, which sees three releases per year. Vodafone overcame hurdles in managing the lifecycle of their Kubernetes clusters, including: Faster pace of lifecycle operations : The adoption of containers and Kubernetes in its 5G network to necessitate quicker feature releases and software updates, demanding more frequent upgrades. Complex dependencies : Tackling inconsistencies resulting from intricate relationships between 5G software applications and the platform itself, often managed through spreadsheets. Complex dependencies are written in one single location, making them easier to discover. Manual management and human error : Improving manual lifecycle management of clusters which could lead to issues during pre-production testing and validation. This avoids using manual deployments and &amp;ldquo;quick &amp;amp; dirty&amp;rdquo; fixes. Time-consuming and high-risk deployments : Avoiding these time consuming and high-risk deployments by having everything well defined as code in a single, tracked and traced common repository made things smoother and faster. Using &amp;ldquo;validated patterns&amp;rdquo; reuses common components that have been shared and improved by the community “If you are managing the lifecycle of these clusters manually,” said Kivlin, “that can lead to problems that need fixing in pre-production as you&amp;rsquo;re doing lifecycle operation testing and validation.

Benefits of changed block tracking support in Kubernetes Key components Implementation requirements Storage provider responsibilities Backup solution responsibilities Getting started What’s next? How do I get involved? We&amp;rsquo;re excited to announce the alpha support for a changed block tracking mechanism. This enhances the Kubernetes storage ecosystem by providing an efficient way for CSI storage drivers to identify changed blocks in PersistentVolume snapshots. With a driver that can use the feature, you could benefit from faster and more resource-efficient backup operations. If you&amp;rsquo;re eager to try this feature, you can skip to the Getting Started section. Changed block tracking enables storage systems to identify and track modifications at the block level between snapshots, eliminating the need to scan entire volumes during backup operations. The improvement is a change to the Container Storage Interface (CSI), and also to the storage support in Kubernetes itself. With the alpha feature enabled, your cluster can: Identify allocated blocks within a CSI volume snapshot Determine changed blocks between two snapshots of the same volume Streamline backup operations by focusing only on changed data blocks For Kubernetes users managing large datasets, this API enables significantly more efficient backup processes. Backup applications can now focus only on the blocks that have changed, rather than processing entire volumes. As Kubernetes adoption grows for stateful workloads managing critical data, the need for efficient backup solutions becomes increasingly important. Traditional full backup approaches face challenges with: Long backup windows : Full volume backups can take hours for large datasets, making it difficult to complete within maintenance windows. High resource utilization : Backup operations consume substantial network bandwidth and I/O resources, especially for large data volumes and data-intensive applications. Increased storage costs : Repetitive full backups store redundant data, causing storage requirements to grow linearly even when only a small percentage of data actually changes between backups.</description></item><item><title>From Chaos to Control: Achieving Network Policy Nirvana with Kyverno</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-09-25-from-chaos-to-control-achieving-network-policy-nirvana-with-kyverno/</link><pubDate>Thu, 25 Sep 2025 08:00:55 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-09-25-from-chaos-to-control-achieving-network-policy-nirvana-with-kyverno/</guid><description>From Chaos to Control: Achieving Network Policy Nirvana with Kyverno The Challenge: The Manual Toil of Network Policies The Solution: Kyverno for Guardrails and Automation Key Insights from the Live Demo Conclusion: Empowering Platform Teams At the recent Kubernetes Community Days (KCD) in San Francisco, Jim Bugwadia, co-founder of Nirmata and a maintainer of the CNCF project Kyverno, delivered a session on one of the most persistent challenges in platform engineering: the balancing act between developer agility and robust security. His talk, “Network Policy Nirvana,” provided a clear roadmap for taming the complexity of Kubernetes network security through automation and policy-as-code. Jim began by framing the core problem. Platform teams are constantly caught between two competing needs: Developers require self-service and agility to ship features quickly. Security and compliance teams require guardrails and control to protect the platform. Nowhere is this tension more apparent than with Kubernetes Network Policies. While essential for security, native Network Policies can be complex, error-prone, and difficult to manage at scale. By default, Kubernetes allows all pods to talk to each other, so securing a cluster requires a “deny-by-default” stance, which can be difficult to implement manually. This leads to several pain points: Complexity: Managing countless YAML files for different applications is prone to error. Lack of Automation: Manual policy review creates bottlenecks and slows down development. Security Gaps: Misconfigurations can easily lead to unintended security vulnerabilities. Jim introduced Kyverno , a policy engine built for Kubernetes, as the solution.</description></item><item><title>Maximize your OpenShift investment: 6 reasons to upgrade to OpenShift Platform Plus</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-09-25-maximize-your-openshift-investment-6-reasons-to-upgrade-to-openshift-platform-pl/</link><pubDate>Thu, 25 Sep 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-09-25-maximize-your-openshift-investment-6-reasons-to-upgrade-to-openshift-platform-pl/</guid><description>Maximize your OpenShift investment: 6 reasons to upgrade to OpenShift Platform Plus Why upgrade to Red Hat OpenShift Platform Plus?

Brian Stinson, principal software engineer The first bit that we start with is Fedora. And that gives us the content set and problem space to look at. And then the things that we need to drive, that will happen continuously. Stef Walter, Senior Director, Engineering Part of what we did was have CentOS Stream be the place where we do RHEL development. A lot of it comes from Fedora, but then a lot of the iteration—constantly having a build, multiple times a day of all of RHEL—is in CentOS Stream. Stinson The main advantage we got out of doing [CentOS Stream] was we were basically doing the build in public, and it actually helped us quite a bit just keeping some of that engagement.</description></item><item><title>Red Hat and O-RAN Alliance accelerating cloud adoption at the Edge</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-09-25-red-hat-and-o-ran-alliance-accelerating-cloud-adoption-at-the-edge/</link><pubDate>Thu, 25 Sep 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-09-25-red-hat-and-o-ran-alliance-accelerating-cloud-adoption-at-the-edge/</guid><description>Red Hat and O-RAN Alliance accelerating cloud adoption at the Edge Foundational principles Cloudification Metal3 Vibrant and robust SMO ecosystem Broad O2-IMS API applicability O-cloud architectural approach Providing thought leadership and direction Community collaboration and open source projects O-RAN Alliance working groups (WG) O-RAN software community (SC) O-cloud proof-of-concept (PoC) integration and evolution Working on an open radio access network Red Hat Learning Subscription | Product Trial About the authors Ian Jolliffe Rob McManus More like this Blog post Blog post Original podcast Original podcast Keep exploring Browse by channel Automation Artificial intelligence Open hybrid cloud Security Edge computing Infrastructure Applications Virtualization Share In telecommunication, bringing compute resources and intelligence closer to users improves the user experience, significantly reduces service provider costs, and unlocks the innovation needed to deliver compelling services that increase revenue. However, telecommunication service providers are faced with challenges when adopting new technologies, methodologies, and automation. Every option must be evaluated for compatibility with a radio access network (RAN). Solving these challenges are the reasons Red Hat has been collaborating and contributing to the O-RAN Alliance. Red Hat is committed to advancing the open radio access network (O-RAN) ecosystem through contributions to open source projects, and industry collaboration. Red Hat is collaborating on critical O-RAN interfaces, fostering a robust hardware partner ecosystem, working with service management and orchestration (SMO) providers, and making ongoing contributions to vital open source O-RAN initiatives. These contributions, of course, all end up in Red Hat&amp;rsquo;s cloud-native products. Red Hat&amp;rsquo;s O-RAN strategy is built on four core principles, all underpinned by open source collaboration. Adoption of cloud-native methodology drives down operational costs and increases reliability of deployment and ongoing management of O-RAN clusters for thousands of nodes at the edge. Cloud-native server clusters span from service provider IT systems, the core, and now to the edge. With AI becoming a part of many deployments, cloud-native principles are more important than ever. Adoption of cloud-native principles in the service provider market has been a challenge, and is a barrier to lower operational expenditure (OpEx).</description></item><item><title>The flight plan for AI: How we’re building a culture of innovation at Turkish Technology</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-09-25-the-flight-plan-for-ai-how-we-re-building-a-culture-of-innovation-at-turkish-tec/</link><pubDate>Thu, 25 Sep 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-09-25-the-flight-plan-for-ai-how-we-re-building-a-culture-of-innovation-at-turkish-tec/</guid><description>The flight plan for AI: How we’re building a culture of innovation at Turkish Technology Beyond the code: A cultural shift Delivering real value at scale Navigating the regulations, securing our future Get started with AI Inference About the author Serdar Gürbüz More like this Blog post Blog post Original podcast Original podcast Keep exploring Browse by channel Automation Artificial intelligence Open hybrid cloud Security Edge computing Infrastructure Applications Virtualization Share When you think of Turkish Airlines, you might picture the vast network of flights that connects more countries than any other airline in the world. You might think of the more than 80 million passengers we serve annually, or the incredible logistical complexity of operating such a massive enterprise across 130 countries and 353 destinations. At Turkish Technology, it&amp;rsquo;s our job to build the digital engine that powers it all. Our mission is to not only manage Turkish Airline systems today, but to build the next-generation digital products that will define the future of aviation. And for us, that future is undeniably driven by AI. My team and I didn&amp;rsquo;t approach AI as a collection of one-off pilot projects. Instead, we saw it as a strategic lever to accelerate our entire digital transformation. Our goal was to build a hardened, scalable, and replicable AI infrastructure that could be woven throughout the fabric of the organization. We embarked on this process nearly 3 years ago, and while we’ve made incredible progress, we know there&amp;rsquo;s no end to this journey–the airplanes always need to keep flying to their next stop. It&amp;rsquo;s an ongoing process and a continuous race to adapt as technology–especially generative AI (gen AI)–evolves at a rapid pace.

The Ansible Lightspeed intelligent assistant is like having an Ansible subject matter expert right at your keyboard. The service integrates documentation directly into the Ansible administrative and operations experience for faster troubleshooting and onboarding, as well as support for the day-to-day management of your automation itself. Ansible Lightspeed intelligent assistant within Ansible Automation Platform This generative AI service is a result of a concerted effort by our product and engineering teams to improve the overall platform user experience for both automation administrators and IT operators. Examples of this include a simplified and unified UI, the release of self-service automation to empower more users, a new on-premise analytics dashboard to measure performance, a fleet of new collections for managing the platform, and more. When we initially launched Red Hat Ansible Lightspeed with IBM watsonx Code Assistant in 2023, its purpose was to provide a robust coding assistant designed to help boost engineering and developer productivity during the creation of Ansible content, including playbooks, roles or tasks. We later embedded features such as content explanation and content source matching for greater transparency and context for model responses as well as prompt refinement and model customization for greater relevance and accuracy. Tapping into IBM&amp;rsquo;s Granite code models and trained on Ansible-specific data sources, the coding assistant democratizes access to automation and helps onboard new users as they familiarize themselves with the Ansible language and syntax. With the intelligent assistant, we bring similar value to Ansible Automation Platform administrators and operators by reducing friction and swivel-chair operations, allowing these users to remain within the platform experience to research, troubleshoot, and resolve common questions and issues. The intelligent assistant can respond to prompts like: &amp;ldquo;What is an execution environment?&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;How do I manage user access to Ansible Automation Platform?&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;Explain the &amp;ldquo;ERROR! couldn’t resolve module/action” error message?&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;How do I configure Event-Driven Ansible?&amp;rdquo; Using a retrieval augmented generation (RAG) pipeline connected to Red Hat documentation and other resources, the intelligent assistant also provides referenced links to additional documentation to help you explore a given topic in more detail. Ansible Lightspeed intelligent assistant prompt, response, and referenced resources Additional roadmap items for the intelligent assistant include expanding data sources to provide visibility into the health and performance of your automation itself. For instance, you will be able to get assistance with prompts such as: &amp;ldquo;Why did my automation &amp;lsquo;VM-migration&amp;rsquo; job fail?&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;Show me all inventories that are included in my Ansible Automation Platform deployment.</description></item><item><title>Securing Your Infrastructure as Code: The Power of Nirmata and HashiCorp Terraform</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-09-23-securing-your-infrastructure-as-code-the-power-of-nirmata-and-hashicorp-terrafor/</link><pubDate>Tue, 23 Sep 2025 20:50:44 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-09-23-securing-your-infrastructure-as-code-the-power-of-nirmata-and-hashicorp-terrafor/</guid><description>Securing Your Infrastructure as Code: The Power of Nirmata and HashiCorp Terraform HashiCorp Terraform: The Foundation of Your Infrastructure Nirmata: The Governance &amp;amp; Security Layer A Practical Synergy HashiCorp Terraform is synonymous with Infrastructure as Code (IaC) and is heavily used for infrastructure provisioning, but often, cloud resources are misconfigured. Also, with the rapid adoption of AI, more IaC is being generated using AI tools. The challenge is to identify misconfigurations early, ensuring that provisioned infrastructure is secure and reliable. At Nirmata, we believe that empowering developers with agile, self-service tools is crucial, but it must be done with guardrails in place. This is where the powerful combination of Nirmata and Terraform comes into play. While Terraform is the industry standard for declaring and provisioning infrastructure, Nirmata provides the essential governance, security, and lifecycle management for that infrastructure and the applications running on it. Terraform, as the leader in Infrastructure as Code (IaC), allows you to define your cloud and on-premises resources in a declarative, human-readable language. With a vast ecosystem of providers, including a Nirmata provider , you can use Terraform to provision everything from a simple virtual machine to a complex, multi-cluster Kubernetes environment on any cloud, like AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud Platform (GCP). The core benefit is clear: you manage your infrastructure in a predictable, repeatable, and version-controlled way. While Terraform is ideal for provisioning, it falls short in addressing the ongoing challenges of Day 2 operations, security, and governance. This is where Nirmata’s policy-based platform complements your Terraform workflows. Think of it this way: Terraform is your blueprint for provisioning infrastructure across any provider and any cloud.</description></item><item><title>Analyst Insight Series: Virtualization Virtue #2: Stronger Cloud Security and Fault Tolerance</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-09-23-analyst-insight-series-virtualization-virtue-2-stronger-cloud-security-and-fault/</link><pubDate>Tue, 23 Sep 2025 14:16:58 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-09-23-analyst-insight-series-virtualization-virtue-2-stronger-cloud-security-and-fault/</guid><description>Related Articles Analyst Insight Series: Virtualization Virtue #2: Stronger Cloud Security and Fault Tolerance First VMmark Result Published Using VMware Cloud Foundation 9.0 VCF Breakroom Chats Episode 57: Behind the Code – A Journey from Customer Pain to VCF 9.0 Guest post by Jean Atelsek, S&amp;amp;P Global Market Intelligence This blog is the second in our series on the benefits and trends of virtualization ( read the first blog here , and a companion to the 451 Research Business Impact Brief “ The virtues of virtualization. ” Securing infrastructure, applications and data has always been a tall order for IT, and it grows taller in modern distributed environments: attack vectors multiply as endpoints are added, and access and identity management becomes more complex. The inherent security enabled by virtualization is a key factor behind the staying power of virtual machines in today’s IT estates. VM isolation, network micro-segmentation and live migration allow operations teams to protect the environment and secure data while maintaining high availability. The scale and sophistication of cyberattacks has surged with growing internet connectivity and AI-driven automation: NIST’s National Vulnerability Database shows that in 2024, a record-breaking 40,009 new common vulnerabilities and exposures (CVEs) were discovered, up 38% from the prior year. 451 Research’s Voice of the Enterprise: Information Security, Budgets &amp;amp; Outlook 2024 survey reveals the impact on security teams, with cloud security, AI/ML implementation, GenAI, and data privacy cited as the top pain points. Not long ago, securing applications was seen as an afterthought, with controls applied after development and before deployment into production, but in today’s dynamic environments this is no longer sufficient. The key is to “shift left” and apply controls by default without losing up-to-the-minute availability of resources for developers. Virtualization accomplishes this by creating an isolated environment for each virtual machine, thereby reducing the attack surface, ideally with out-of-the-box configurations for protecting data, implementing hardening and security best practices, authenticating users (including non-human identities such as AI agents), and rotating certificates automatically. To ensure high availability, VMs benefit from redundancy—periodically saving snapshots in a remote location so configurations can be restored in case of an outage—and the ability to do live migration between physical hosts. Because virtualization defines machine characteristics in software, failover can be “designed in” to the environment to automatically recover without impacting the user experience. This advantage applies not only during emergencies but also when upgrading underlying hardware.</description></item><item><title>The FinOps Journey: From Visibility to Business Value</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-09-23-the-finops-journey-from-visibility-to-business-value/</link><pubDate>Tue, 23 Sep 2025 12:50:15 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-09-23-the-finops-journey-from-visibility-to-business-value/</guid><description>FinOps Maturity Phases Phase 1: Shedding Light on IT Costs Phase 2: Planning Ahead Phase 3: Running IT Like a Business Final Thoughts Related Articles The FinOps Journey: From Visibility to Business Value Capacity Management: The IT Balancing Act You Can’t Ignore Deploy Distributed LLM Inference with GPUDirect RDMA over InfiniBand in VMware Private AI Let’s be real — IT costs can be a black box. Servers hum, invoices arrive, and before you know it, your cloud spend is climbing faster than your budget can keep up. That’s where FinOps comes in. If you haven’t heard the term before, Financial Operations (FinOps) is all about bringing financial discipline to the way you run IT. It’s the practice of tracking, forecasting, and optimizing spending on IT resources so that every dollar works harder. FinOps isn’t just for the big players anymore. What started as a process for larger service providers has now been embraced by smaller businesses, giving them the same ability to control cloud costs, improve efficiency, and drive smarter financial decisions. Why? Because when IT understands the true cost of delivering services, it stops being “just” a cost center and becomes a strategic business partner. And every organization’s path to FinOps maturity is different, but most will move through these three phases. Phase 1: Gaining an understanding of their costs (Inform) Phase 2: To planning and budgeting for future projects (Optimize) Phase 3: To ultimately, running IT like a business (Operate) The good news? Regardless of where you are in the process, VMware Cloud Foundation and its FinOps capabilities can help at every step. Phase 1 of the FinOps journey begins with understanding and managing your costs. Why This Matters: Financial Operations (FinOps) is about more than just saving money.</description></item><item><title>AI and Red Hat: Powering the future of cable providers</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-09-23-ai-and-red-hat-powering-the-future-of-cable-providers/</link><pubDate>Tue, 23 Sep 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-09-23-ai-and-red-hat-powering-the-future-of-cable-providers/</guid><description>AI and Red Hat: Powering the future of cable providers The strategic play: From legacy to smart networks Automation: The North American efficiency imperative Machine Learning: Gaining a competitive edge Security: Non-negotiable for trust and compliance Addressing the future: Multilatency and AI workloads Maximizing ROI: New revenue streams and Edge AI Delivering a combined solution Learn more at SCTE TechExpo 2025 Hatville: miniature city where edge computing comes to life About the author Rob Wilmoth More like this Blog post Blog post Original podcast Original podcast Keep exploring Browse by channel Automation Artificial intelligence Open hybrid cloud Security Edge computing Infrastructure Applications Virtualization Share North American cable providers are in the middle of a massive shift.

How to specify resources for an entire Pod Example manifest Interaction with container-level resource requests or limits Limitations On behalf of the Kubernetes community, I am thrilled to announce that the Pod Level Resources feature has graduated to Beta in the Kubernetes v1.34 release and is enabled by default! This significant milestone introduces a new layer of flexibility for defining and managing resource allocation for your Pods. This flexibility stems from the ability to specify CPU and memory resources for the Pod as a whole. Pod level resources can be combined with the container-level specifications to express the exact resource requirements and limits your application needs. Until recently, resource specifications that applied to Pods were primarily defined at the individual container level. While effective, this approach sometimes required duplicating or meticulously calculating resource needs across multiple containers within a single Pod. As a beta feature, Kubernetes allows you to specify the CPU, memory and hugepages resources at the Pod-level. This means you can now define resource requests and limits for an entire Pod, enabling easier resource sharing without requiring granular, per-container management of these resources where it&amp;rsquo;s not needed. This feature enhances resource management in Kubernetes by offering flexible resource management at both the Pod and container levels. It provides a consolidated approach to resource declaration, reducing the need for meticulous, per-container management, especially for Pods with multiple containers. Pod-level resources enable containers within a pod to share unused resoures amongst themselves, promoting efficient utilization within the pod. For example, it prevents sidecar containers from becoming performance bottlenecks. Previously, a sidecar (e.</description></item><item><title>Build faster, debug smarter, and make AI safer with new DigitalOcean Gradient™ AI Platform features</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-09-22-build-faster-debug-smarter-and-make-ai-safer-with-new-digitalocean-gradient-ai-p/</link><pubDate>Mon, 22 Sep 2025 15:40:41 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-09-22-build-faster-debug-smarter-and-make-ai-safer-with-new-digitalocean-gradient-ai-p/</guid><description>Build faster, debug smarter, and make AI safer with new DigitalOcean Gradientâ¢ AI Platform features Build better knowledge bases with activity logs Build faster with agent templates Automate workflows with n8n integration Make AI safer with enhanced guardrails Always evolving for developers About the author Try DigitalOcean for free Related Articles Announcing Gateway API Support for DigitalOcean Kubernetes What&amp;rsquo;s New on DigitalOcean App Platform Single Sign-On is Now Available, Strengthening Security and Simplifying Authentication By Grace Morgan Updated: September 19, 2025 3 min read The way developers build with AI is changing fastâand so is the DigitalOcean Gradientâ¢ AI Platform.

The topics covered are, however, overwhelmingly relevant to understand its scope of work. As we approach the Steering Committee elections, it provides useful insights into the workings of the Committee. The Kubernetes Steering Committee is the backbone of the Kubernetes project, ensuring that its vibrant community and governance structures operate smoothly and effectively. While the technical brilliance of Kubernetes is often spotlighted through its Special Interest Groups (SIGs) and Working Groups (WGs) , the unsung heroes quietly steering the ship are the members of the Steering Committee. They tackle complex organizational challenges, empower contributors, and foster the thriving open source ecosystem that Kubernetes is celebrated for. But what does it really take to lead one of the world’s largest open source communities? What are the hidden challenges, and what drives these individuals to dedicate their time and effort to such an impactful role? In this exclusive conversation, we sit down with current Steering Committee (SC) members — Ben, Nabarun, Paco, Patrick, and Maciej — to uncover the rewarding, and sometimes demanding, realities of steering Kubernetes. From their personal journeys and motivations to the committee’s vital responsibilities and future outlook, this Spotlight offers a rare behind-the-scenes glimpse into the people who keep Kubernetes on course. Sandipan: Can you tell us a little bit about yourself? Ben : Hi, I’m Benjamin Elder , also known as BenTheElder. I started in Kubernetes as a Google Summer of Code student in 2015 and have been working at Google in the space since 2017. I have contributed a lot to many areas but especially build, CI, test tooling, etc. My favorite project so far was building KIND.</description></item><item><title>Worldpay's Platform as a Product: Revolutionizing development with Red Hat OpenShift</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-09-22-worldpay-s-platform-as-a-product-revolutionizing-development-with-red-hat-opensh/</link><pubDate>Mon, 22 Sep 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-09-22-worldpay-s-platform-as-a-product-revolutionizing-development-with-red-hat-opensh/</guid><description>Worldpay&amp;rsquo;s Platform as a Product: Revolutionizing development with Red Hat OpenShift GKOP: More than just OpenShift The pillars of a compelling platform product API-driven self-service and automated validation Cultivating a great developer experience Red Hat Learning Subscription | Product Trial About the author Alex Handy More like this Blog post Blog post Original podcast Original podcast Keep exploring Browse by channel Automation Artificial intelligence Open hybrid cloud Security Edge computing Infrastructure Applications Virtualization Share Worldpay has fundamentally transformed its development processes by leveraging Red Hat OpenShift as the foundation for its internal developer platform, dubbed the Global Kubernetes Orchestration Platform (GKOP). This strategic shift has enabled Worldpay to empower its development teams with self-service capabilities, fostering a culture of collaboration and efficiency. Launched in 2020, GKOP is an enterprise platform built on Red Hat OpenShift Service on AWS (ROSA), a fully managed turnkey application platform. It is PCI DSS compliant and manages a fleet of 28 clusters across multiple regions. Worldpay views GKOP as a product, not just a platform. Things must run smoothly and reliably, so the GKOP team has built extensive automation around it. “GKOP is our product, because it&amp;rsquo;s so much more than just OpenShift. We built a lot of automation around it so the backbone of GKOP is the orchestration and configuration management. We asked ourselves ‘How do we do it? How do we run a fleet of clusters and manage them at scale?&amp;quot; asked Bernd Malmqvist, director of platform engineering at Worldpay. “Our cluster management basically is rendering the configuration [which is then] applied to downstream clusters… In disaster recovery exercises, we delete a region and rebuild it from scratch, from start to finish, within one and a half hours. We achieve this because the configuration is pre-rendered. When a cluster comes back online, configuration can be instantly applied.</description></item><item><title>Kubernetes v1.34: Recovery From Volume Expansion Failure (GA)</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-09-19-kubernetes-v1-34-recovery-from-volume-expansion-failure-ga/</link><pubDate>Fri, 19 Sep 2025 10:30:00 -0800</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-09-19-kubernetes-v1-34-recovery-from-volume-expansion-failure-ga/</guid><description>Kubernetes v1.34: Recovery From Volume Expansion Failure (GA) Reducing PVC size to recover from failed expansion Improved error handling and observability of volume expansion Improved observability of in-progress expansion Improved error handling and reporting Fixes long standing bugs in resizing workflows Have you ever made a typo when expanding your persistent volumes in Kubernetes? Meant to specify 2TB but specified 20TiB ? This seemingly innocuous problem was kinda hard to fix - and took the project almost 5 years to fix. Automated recovery from storage expansion has been around for a while in beta; however, with the v1.34 release, we have graduated this to general availability. 2TB 20TiB While it was always possible to recover from failing volume expansions manually, it usually required cluster-admin access and was tedious to do (See aformentioned link for more information). What if you make a mistake and then realize immediately? With Kubernetes v1.34, you should be able to reduce the requested size of the PersistentVolumeClaim (PVC) and, as long as the expansion to previously requested size hadn&amp;rsquo;t finished, you can amend the size requested. Kubernetes will automatically work to correct it. Any quota consumed by failed expansion will be returned to the user and the associated PersistentVolume should be resized to the latest size you specified. I&amp;rsquo;ll walk through an example of how all of this works. Imagine that you are running out of disk space for one of your database servers, and you want to expand the PVC from previously specified 10TB to 100TB - but you make a typo and specify 1000TB. 10TB 100TB 1000TB kind : PersistentVolumeClaim apiVersion : v1 metadata : name : myclaim spec : accessModes : - ReadWriteOnce resources : requests : storage : 1000TB # newly specified size - but incorrect! kind : PersistentVolumeClaim apiVersion : v1 metadata : name : myclaim spec : accessModes : - ReadWriteOnce resources : requests : storage : 1000TB # newly specified size - but incorrect! Now, you may be out of disk space on your disk array or simply ran out of allocated quota on your cloud-provider. But, assume that expansion to 1000TB is never going to succeed. 1000TB In Kubernetes v1.34, you can simply correct your mistake and request a new PVC size, that is smaller than the mistake, provided it is still larger than the original size of the actual PersistentVolume. kind : PersistentVolumeClaim apiVersion : v1 metadata : name : myclaim spec : accessModes : - ReadWriteOnce resources : requests : storage : 100TB # Corrected size; has to be greater than 10TB.</description></item><item><title>First VMmark Result Published Using VMware Cloud Foundation 9.0</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-09-19-first-vmmark-result-published-using-vmware-cloud-foundation-9-0/</link><pubDate>Fri, 19 Sep 2025 17:44:10 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-09-19-first-vmmark-result-published-using-vmware-cloud-foundation-9-0/</guid><description>Related Related Articles First VMmark Result Published Using VMware Cloud Foundation 9.0 VCF Breakroom Chats Episode 57: Behind the Code – A Journey from Customer Pain to VCF 9.0 10 VMware Cloud Foundation 9.0 Enhancements: Simplifying Your Day 2 Operations We are excited to announce the first VMmark 4 result using our latest release, VMware Cloud Foundation (VCF) 9.0.

This challenge is not new. In a recent episode of the Technically Speaking podcast, Chris Wright spoke with Nick Hill, a principal software engineer at Red Hat who worked on the commercialization of the original IBM Watson &amp;ldquo;Jeopardy!&amp;rdquo; system years ago. Hill noted that these early efforts focused on optimizing Watson down from a room full of servers to a single machine, establishing that systems-level engineering is key to making powerful AI practical. Wright and Hill also discussed how this same principle applies to modern LLMs and the vLLM open source project, which is revolutionizing AI inference by making AI more practical and performant at scale. [embed YouTube video here Building more efficient AI with vLLM ft. Nick Hill | Technically Speaking with Chris Wright ] vLLM is an inference server that directly addresses the efficiency and scalability challenges faced when working with generative AI (gen AI). By maximizing the use of expensive GPU resources, vLLM makes powerful AI more accessible and practical. Red Hat is deeply involved in the vLLM project as a significant commercial contributor. We have integrated a hardened, supported, and enterprise-ready version of vLLM into Red Hat AI Inference Server. This product is available as a standalone containerized offering, or as a key component of the larger Red Hat AI portfolio, including Red Hat Enterprise Linux AI (RHEL AI) and Red Hat OpenShift AI.

As a DRA driver developer As a consumer Integration with DRA device status What can you do next? Conclusion Further Reading Dynamic Resource Allocation (DRA) is a Kubernetes API for managing scarce resources across Pods and containers. It enables flexible resource requests, going beyond simply allocating N number of devices to support more granular usage scenarios. With DRA, users can request specific types of devices based on their attributes, define custom configurations tailored to their workloads, and even share the same resource among multiple containers or Pods. In this blog, we focus on the device sharing feature and dive into a new capability introduced in Kubernetes 1.34: DRA consumable capacity , which extends DRA to support finer-grained device sharing. From the beginning, DRA introduced the ability for multiple Pods to share a device by referencing the same ResourceClaim. This design decouples resource allocation from specific hardware, allowing for more dynamic and reusable provisioning of devices. In Kubernetes 1.33, the new support for partitionable devices allowed resource drivers to advertise slices of a device that are available, rather than exposing the entire device as an all-or-nothing resource. This enabled Kubernetes to model shareable hardware more accurately. But there was still a missing piece: it didn&amp;rsquo;t yet support scenarios where the device driver manages fine-grained, dynamic portions of a device resource — like network bandwidth — based on user demand, or to share those resources independently of ResourceClaims, which are restricted by their spec and namespace. That’s where consumable capacity for DRA comes in. Here&amp;rsquo;s a taste of what you get in a cluster with the DRAConsumableCapacity feature gate enabled. DRAConsumableCapacity Resource drivers can now support sharing the same device — or even a slice of a device — across multiple ResourceClaims or across multiple DeviceRequests.</description></item><item><title>VCF Breakroom Chats Episode 57: Behind the Code – A Journey from Customer Pain to VCF 9.0</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-09-18-vcf-breakroom-chats-episode-57-behind-the-code-a-journey-from-customer-pain-to-v/</link><pubDate>Thu, 18 Sep 2025 17:31:45 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-09-18-vcf-breakroom-chats-episode-57-behind-the-code-a-journey-from-customer-pain-to-v/</guid><description>VCF Breakroom Chats Episode 57 About the VCF Breakroom Chat Series Related Related Articles VCF Breakroom Chats Episode 57: Behind the Code – A Journey from Customer Pain to VCF 9.0 10 VMware Cloud Foundation 9 Enhancements: Simplifying Your Day 2 Operations Deploy Distributed LLM Inference with GPUDirect RDMA over InfiniBand in VMware Private AI Welcome to the next episode of the VCF Breakroom Chats.

In previous versions such as VCF 5.2, many administrative tasks—such as network pool creation, host commissioning, and workload domain deployments—were tightly coupled with SDDC Manager and performing them outside of it often led to issues. VCF 9.0 introduces significant enhancements in Day 2 operations, offering greater flexibility by shifting many of these tasks to more familiar tools such as VMware vCenter and VCF Operations. This evolution not only streamlines workflows but also empowers administrators with more direct control. This post highlights 10 key operational changes that organizations should consider when planning and executing an upgrade to VCF 9.0. While not an exhaustive list, these insights are based on recurring themes in customer conversations and real-world upgrade experiences. In VCF 5.2, network pool creation, expansion, and deletion are performed in SDDC Manager. Administration -&amp;gt; Network Settings -&amp;gt; Network Pool In VCF 9.0, these tasks are performed through vCenter. You do not need any additional configuration to act on the Management Domain networks, however you must be using VCF SSO and vCenter Server Linking for Workload Domains.

I recently visited Japan, a beautiful country with a rich and defined culture, and was reminded of how deeply language and culture are intertwined. Language structure reflects and also influences how people perceive the world. For example, some cultures are more informal, while others with established social hierarchies tend to be more formal. It’s manifested grammatically, and also in the way people greet each other, the way questions are formed, and the very rhythm of conversation. This experience sparked a question for me: as we build a new generation of AI, how do we train it to speak the language of all cultures? We often hear about AI as a revolutionary global tool, a technology for all of humanity. But if AI is learning from our collective data, whose culture is it truly learning? The promise of a universally intelligent system is powerful, but it masks a critical issue, in that today&amp;rsquo;s most powerful AI models are not culturally neutral. They are a direct reflection of their training data, which is overwhelmingly English-centric and Western-biased. The concept of &amp;ldquo;AI sovereignty&amp;rdquo; becomes particularly relevant to this Western-biased model training. It&amp;rsquo;s not simply about having access to technology or hardware, but also about building AI that can reflect a nation&amp;rsquo;s or community&amp;rsquo;s unique languages, values, and culture. We believe the key to achieving this lies in the world of open source AI. Digital sovereignty, particularly in the context of AI, is rapidly evolving from an abstract concept to a critical, real-world issue.</description></item><item><title>Kubernetes v1.34: Pods Report DRA Resource Health</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-09-17-kubernetes-v1-34-pods-report-dra-resource-health/</link><pubDate>Wed, 17 Sep 2025 10:30:00 -0800</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-09-17-kubernetes-v1-34-pods-report-dra-resource-health/</guid><description>Kubernetes v1.34: Pods Report DRA Resource Health Why expose device health in Pod status? How it works A new gRPC health service Kubelet integration Populating the Pod status A practical example How to use this feature DRA drivers What&amp;rsquo;s next? The rise of AI/ML and other high-performance workloads has made specialized hardware like GPUs, TPUs, and FPGAs a critical component of many Kubernetes clusters. However, as discussed in a previous blog post about navigating failures in Pods with devices , when this hardware fails, it can be difficult to diagnose, leading to significant downtime. With the release of Kubernetes v1.34, we are excited to announce a new alpha feature that brings much-needed visibility into the health of these devices. This work extends the functionality of KEP-4680 , which first introduced a mechanism for reporting the health of devices managed by Device Plugins. Now, this capability is being extended to Dynamic Resource Allocation (DRA). Controlled by the ResourceHealthStatus feature gate, this enhancement allows DRA drivers to report device health directly into a Pod&amp;rsquo;s. status field, providing crucial insights for operators and developers. ResourceHealthStatus. status For stateful applications or long-running jobs, a device failure can be disruptive and costly. By exposing device health in the. status field for a Pod, Kubernetes provides a standardized way for users and automation tools to quickly diagnose issues. If a Pod is failing, you can now check its status to see if an unhealthy device is the root cause, saving valuable time that might otherwise be spent debugging application code.</description></item><item><title>Kubernetes v1.34: Moving Volume Group Snapshots to v1beta2</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-09-16-kubernetes-v1-34-moving-volume-group-snapshots-to-v1beta2/</link><pubDate>Tue, 16 Sep 2025 10:30:00 -0800</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-09-16-kubernetes-v1-34-moving-volume-group-snapshots-to-v1beta2/</guid><description>Kubernetes v1.34: Moving Volume Group Snapshots to v1beta2 What&amp;rsquo;s new in Beta 2? What’s next? How do I get involved? Volume group snapshots were introduced as an Alpha feature with the Kubernetes 1.27 release and moved to Beta in the Kubernetes 1.32 release. The recent release of Kubernetes v1.34 moved that support to a second beta. The support for volume group snapshots relies on a set of extension APIs for group snapshots. These APIs allow users to take crash consistent snapshots for a set of volumes. Behind the scenes, Kubernetes uses a label selector to group multiple PersistentVolumeClaims for snapshotting. A key aim is to allow you restore that set of snapshots to new volumes and recover your workload based on a crash consistent recovery point. This new feature is only supported for CSI volume drivers. While testing the beta version, we encountered an issue where the restoreSize field is not set for individual VolumeSnapshotContents and VolumeSnapshots if CSI driver does not implement the ListSnapshots RPC call. We evaluated various options here and decided to make this change releasing a new beta for the API. restoreSize Specifically, a VolumeSnapshotInfo struct is added in v1beta2, it contains information for an individual volume snapshot that is a member of a volume group snapshot. VolumeSnapshotInfoList, a list of VolumeSnapshotInfo, is added to VolumeGroupSnapshotContentStatus, replacing VolumeSnapshotHandlePairList. VolumeSnapshotInfoList is a list of snapshot information returned by the CSI driver to identify snapshots on the storage system.</description></item><item><title>Best DevOps Courses in 2025: Learning Paths to Boost Your Career</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-09-16-best-devops-courses-in-2025-learning-paths-to-boost-your-career/</link><pubDate>Tue, 16 Sep 2025 17:19:01 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-09-16-best-devops-courses-in-2025-learning-paths-to-boost-your-career/</guid><description>2025-ready skills - IT Foundations &amp;ndash;&amp;gt; Linux &amp;amp; Networking &amp;ndash;&amp;gt; Git &amp;ndash;&amp;gt; Containers &amp;ndash;&amp;gt; Kubernetes &amp;ndash;&amp;gt; CI/CD &amp;ndash;&amp;gt; IaC &amp;ndash;&amp;gt; GitOps &amp;ndash;&amp;gt; Observability &amp;ndash;&amp;gt; Security &amp;ndash;&amp;gt; Platform Engineering &amp;ndash;&amp;gt; Cloud &amp;ndash;&amp;gt; AI.

By granting VMs exclusive, high-performance access to NVIDIA GPUs, DirectPath allows organizations to fully harness GPU capabilities without added licensing complexity. This makes it easier to experiment, prototype, and move AI projects into production with confidence. Besides, VMware Private AI brings models closer to enterprise data, delivering secure, efficient, and cost-effective deployments. Jointly engineered by Broadcom and NVIDIA, the solution empowers organizations to accelerate innovation while reducing total cost of ownership (TCO). These advancements come at a critical time. Serving state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs) like DeepSeek-R1 , Meta Llama-3.1-405B-Instruct , and Qwen3-235B-A22B-thinking at full context length often exceeds the capacity of a single 8x H100 GPU server, making distributed inference essential. Aggregating resources from multiple GPU-enabled nodes allows these models to run efficiently, though it introduces new challenges in infrastructure management, interconnect optimization, and workload scheduling. This is where VMware Cloud Foundation (VCF) plays a vital role. VCF is the industry’s first private cloud platform to deliver public cloud scale and agility while providing on-premises security, resilience, and performance—all with lower TCO. Leveraging technologies such as NVIDIA NVLink , NVSwitch , and GPUDirect® RDMA , VCF enables high-bandwidth, low-latency communication across nodes. It also ensures that network interconnects like InfiniBand (IB) and RoCEv2 (RDMA over Converged Ethernet) are used effectively, reducing communication overhead that can limit distributed inference performance.</description></item><item><title>Distributed performance testing for Kubernetes environments: Grafana k6 Operator 1.0 is here</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-09-16-distributed-performance-testing-for-kubernetes-environments-grafana-k6-operator-/</link><pubDate>Tue, 16 Sep 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-09-16-distributed-performance-testing-for-kubernetes-environments-grafana-k6-operator-/</guid><description>Try using Grot AI for this query -&amp;gt;.</description></item><item><title>Fedora 43 Beta now available</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-09-16-fedora-43-beta-now-available/</link><pubDate>Tue, 16 Sep 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-09-16-fedora-43-beta-now-available/</guid><description>Fedora 43 Beta now available What’s new in Fedora 43 Beta?

Learn more about the new and updated features of Fedora 43 Beta below and don’t forget to make sure that your system is fully up-to-date before upgrading from a previous release. Anaconda WebUI for Fedora Spins by default: Creates a more consistent and modern installation experience across all Fedora desktop variants, and brings us closer to eventually replacing the older GTK installer, allowing all Fedora users to benefit from the same polished and user-friendly interface. Switch Anaconda installer to DNF5: Provides better support and debugging for package-based applications within Anaconda, and is a bigger step towards the eventual deprecation or removal of DNF4, which is now in maintenance mode. Enable auto-updates by default in Fedora Kinoite: Assures users are more consistently running a system with the latest bug fixes and features after a simple reboot, with updates applied automatically in the background. Set default monospace fallback font: Establishes a standard fallback font when a specified monospace font is missing. The font selection also remains more stable and predictable, even when the user installs new font packages, and no jarring font changes that were in previous versions. GNU toolchain update: Allows Fedora to stay current with the latest features, improvements, and bug and security fixes from the upstream gcc, glibc, binutils, and gdb projects, and delivers a working system compiler, assembler, static and dynamic linker, core language runtimes, and debugger. Package-specific RPM macros for build flags: Provides a standard way for packages to add to the default list of compiler flags. It also offers a cleaner and simpler method for package maintainers to make per-package adjustments to build flags, avoiding the need to manually edit and re-export environmental variables, and prevents potential issues that could arise from the old manual method, confirming that flag adjustments are applied appropriately. Build Fedora CoreOS using Containerfile: This change brings the Fedora CoreOS (FCOS) build process under a standard container image build, moving away from the custom tool, CoreOS Assembler. It also means that anyone with Podman installed can build FCOS, which simplifies the process for both individual users and automated pipelines.</description></item><item><title>Unlocking AI innovation: GPU-as-a-Service with Red Hat</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-09-16-unlocking-ai-innovation-gpu-as-a-service-with-red-hat/</link><pubDate>Tue, 16 Sep 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-09-16-unlocking-ai-innovation-gpu-as-a-service-with-red-hat/</guid><description>Unlocking AI innovation: GPU-as-a-Service with Red Hat The GPU challenge: A multifaceted problem for ITOps Red Hat&amp;rsquo;s solution: Solving the GPU puzzle with GPU-as-a-Service Key components for delivering GPU-as-a-Service Red Hat: Your partner in AI innovation Get started with AI Inference About the author Martin Isaksson More like this Blog post Blog post Original podcast Original podcast Keep exploring Browse by channel Automation Artificial intelligence Open hybrid cloud Security Edge computing Infrastructure Applications Virtualization Share Graphics processing units (GPUs) are key to both generative and predictive AI. Data scientists, machine learning engineers, and AI engineers rely on GPUs to experiment with AI models, and to train, tune, and deploy them. Managing these essential resources can be complex, however, often stalling development and innovation. Infrastructure limitations shouldn&amp;rsquo;t hold your organization back. Your team needs to focus on building, refining, and using AI models, not managing complex GPU infrastructure. This is why information technology operations (ITOps) plays a crucial role in enabling rapid AI development and inference by providing on-demand GPU access, also known as GPU-as-a-Service. Setting up an efficient GPU infrastructure for AI workloads is not trivial, and ITOps teams face several significant challenges: GPU scarcity and cost constraints : GPUs can be challenging to access due to limited supply, cloud constraints, and internal competition. This can be further compounded with a lack of customer choice and control over the underlying accelerator architecture, not to mention that. GPUs already come with high costs, including acquisition and operational expenses, and are often underused. Lack of GPU access drives shadow IT : If data scientists, ML engineers, and AI engineers cannot readily access GPUs when they need them, they may turn to &amp;ldquo;shadow IT. &amp;quot; This can mean using third-party services, potentially exposing sensitive company data, or independently procuring GPU resources from various cloud providers, leading to increased costs and security risks. This results in a loss of control over resource usage, data security, and compliance.</description></item><item><title>Use the RHEL command-line assistant offline with this new developer preview</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-09-16-use-the-rhel-command-line-assistant-offline-with-this-new-developer-preview/</link><pubDate>Tue, 16 Sep 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-09-16-use-the-rhel-command-line-assistant-offline-with-this-new-developer-preview/</guid><description>Use the RHEL command-line assistant offline with this new developer preview Architecture overview Prerequisites and requirements Hardware requirements Getting started Configure the GPU Configure the command-line assistant client Usage First query response delay CPU-only systems Intended for individual system use cases Conclusion Get started with AI Inference About the authors Brian Smith Máirín Duffy Sally O&amp;rsquo;Malley More like this Blog post Blog post Original podcast Original podcast Keep exploring Browse by channel Automation Artificial intelligence Open hybrid cloud Security Edge computing Infrastructure Applications Virtualization Share An offline version of the Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) command-line assistant powered by RHEL Lightspeed is now available as a developer preview to existing Red Hat Satellite subscribers.

How to get involved? This enhancement separates the responsibility of managing node lifecycle and pod eviction into two distinct components. Previously, the node lifecycle controller handled both marking nodes as unhealthy with NoExecute taints and evicting pods from them. Now, a dedicated taint eviction controller manages the eviction process, while the node lifecycle controller focuses solely on applying taints. This separation not only improves code organization but also makes it easier to improve taint eviction controller or build custom implementations of the taint based eviction. The feature gate SeparateTaintEvictionController has been promoted to GA in this release. Users can optionally disable taint-based eviction by setting &amp;ndash;controllers=-taint-eviction-controller in kube-controller-manager.

Inference is the procedure by which a trained AI model processes new input data and generates an output. As organizations deploy these models in production, the costs can quickly become substantial, especially with high token volumes, long prompts, and growing usage demands. To run LLMs in a cost-effective and high-performing way, a comprehensive strategy is essential. This approach addresses two critical areas: optimizing the inference runtime and optimizing the model itself. Basic serving methods often struggle with inefficient GPU memory usage, suboptimal batch processing, and slow token generation. This is where a high-performance inference runtime becomes critical. vLLM, is the de facto, open source library that helps LLMs perform calculations more efficiently and at scale. vLLM addresses these runtime challenges with advanced techniques, including: Continuous batching : Instead of processing requests one by one, vLLM groups tokens from multiple sequences into batches. This minimizes GPU idle time and significantly improves GPU utilization and inference throughput. PagedAttention : This memory management strategy efficiently handles large key-value (KV) caches. By dynamically allocating and managing GPU memory pages, PagedAttention greatly increases the number of concurrent requests and supports longer sequences without memory bottlenecks.</description></item><item><title>AI-assisted development: Supercharging the open source way</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-09-15-ai-assisted-development-supercharging-the-open-source-way/</link><pubDate>Mon, 15 Sep 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-09-15-ai-assisted-development-supercharging-the-open-source-way/</guid><description>AI-assisted development: Supercharging the open source way AI as a collaborator in open source development Upstream, with AI in the loop Navigating the new frontier with openness and trust Any model, any accelerator, any cloud: Unlocking enterprise AI with open source innovation About the author Chris Wright More like this Blog post Blog post Original podcast Original podcast Keep exploring Browse by channel Automation Artificial intelligence Open hybrid cloud Security Edge computing Infrastructure Applications Virtualization Share Note: This post is the first in a series that will take readers inside our AI projects, share how we’re equipping our engineers for the AI era, and dig into the legal and ethical frameworks we’re grappling with at Red Hat. Our intention is to not only highlight our practices, but also start discussions and spur ideas on the future of software development. The world of technology is in the midst of a seismic shift. Artificial intelligence, particularly generative AI (gen AI), is rapidly evolving from a futuristic concept into a tangible tool with the potential to redefine how we build software. For those of us who have built our careers on open source principles of software development, this moment is pivotal. And a bit unnerving. At Red Hat, we&amp;rsquo;ve always believed that the most powerful innovations are born from collaboration, transparency, and a shared commitment to solving complex problems. As we head into the AI era, we believe these same principles are not just relevant, but essential. Using AI in open source isn&amp;rsquo;t about replacing the developer; it&amp;rsquo;s about empowering them. It’s about enhancing the creativity and ingenuity that has always been at the heart of open source. We see AI as a powerful new collaborator in the open source community—a tool that can help us scale software development, tackle more ambitious projects, and accelerate the pace of innovation for everyone.

If you missed it, this risk is real, and proactive organizations are already preparing for it. Q-day is predicted to occur between 2029 and 2032, so now is the time to prepare. The core issue at hand is that many of our current cryptographic systems, like RSA, rely on mathematical problems that are simple for classical computers to do in one direction, but extremely difficult to reverse. For example, multiplying 2 large prime numbers is simple, but factoring the result back to its original prime numbers is very hard. This is modern public-key cryptography, also called asymmetric cryptography. In contrast, symmetric cryptography relies on a single shared secret key for both encryption and decryption and requires a secure method for sharing that secret key beforehand. With public-key cryptography being the most common and practical way for computers to share that secret, we must also be aware that CRQCs can weaken the effectiveness of symmetric keys in addition to compromising the most common method by which those keys are shared. CRQCs can do factoring at a scale and speed that is impossible with existing computers. Instead of multiple lifetimes, RSA can be broken in seconds. New cryptographic algorithms are needed to resist these new attacks, and those new algorithms (e.</description></item><item><title>Kubernetes v1.34: Autoconfiguration for Node Cgroup Driver Goes GA</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-09-12-kubernetes-v1-34-autoconfiguration-for-node-cgroup-driver-goes-ga/</link><pubDate>Fri, 12 Sep 2025 10:30:00 -0800</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-09-12-kubernetes-v1-34-autoconfiguration-for-node-cgroup-driver-goes-ga/</guid><description>Kubernetes v1.34: Autoconfiguration for Node Cgroup Driver Goes GA Automated cgroup driver detection Announcement: Kubernetes is deprecating containerd v1. y support Historically, configuring the correct cgroup driver has been a pain point for users running new Kubernetes clusters. On Linux systems, there are two different cgroup drivers: cgroupfs and systemd. In the past, both the kubelet and CRI implementation (like CRI-O or containerd) needed to be configured to use the same cgroup driver, or else the kubelet would misbehave without any explicit error message. This was a source of headaches for many cluster admins. Now, we&amp;rsquo;ve (almost) arrived at the end of that headache. cgroupfs systemd In v1.28.0, the SIG Node community introduced the feature gate KubeletCgroupDriverFromCRI , which instructs the kubelet to ask the CRI implementation which cgroup driver to use. After many releases of waiting for each CRI implementation to have major versions released and packaged in major operating systems, this feature has gone GA as of Kubernetes 1.34.0. KubeletCgroupDriverFromCRI In addition to setting the feature gate, a cluster admin needs to ensure their CRI implementation is new enough: containerd: Support was added in v2.0.0 CRI-O: Support was added in v1.28.0 While CRI-O releases versions that match Kubernetes versions, and thus CRI-O versions without this behavior are no longer supported, containerd maintains its own release cycle. containerd support for this feature is only in v2.0 and later, but Kubernetes 1.34 still supports containerd 1.7 and other LTS releases of containerd. The Kubernetes SIG Node community has formally agreed upon a final support timeline for containerd v1. y.</description></item><item><title>Boost Operational Efficiency with VMware Cloud Foundation</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-09-12-boost-operational-efficiency-with-vmware-cloud-foundation/</link><pubDate>Fri, 12 Sep 2025 18:20:05 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-09-12-boost-operational-efficiency-with-vmware-cloud-foundation/</guid><description>Fleet-Level Lifecycle Management Unified Visibility Across Infrastructure, Databases, and Applications Why Upgrade to VCF Now?

From the applications you use daily to the critical infrastructure powering our society, open source software is ubiquitous. However, this widespread adoption has brought with it an escalating need for robust security, a reality starkly highlighted by incidents like SolarWinds and the more recent XZ Utils vulnerability. While the open source community often demonstrates remarkable resilience and collaboration in addressing threats, a significant shift in responsibility is now underway, driven in part by legislation, such as the EU&amp;rsquo;s Cyber Resilience Act (CRA). For decades, open source security was a communal effort, relying on the goodwill and expertise of contributors. As commercial entities increasingly integrate open source into their products, they&amp;rsquo;ve often overlooked security at the source (i. e. upstream), instead opting to bolt on fixes only at product release. Despite security engineers tirelessly advocating for practices like supply chain security, widespread adoption has been limited due to this afterthought mindset. Many organizations who are comfortable with their long-standing practices of consuming open source software have resisted re-evaluating their approach, operating under the dangerous and flawed assumption that since it worked fine for years and someone else always took care of it, there&amp;rsquo;s no need to change. This mindset ignores a fundamental truth: security isn&amp;rsquo;t about avoiding compromise, but about making it as difficult as possible for attackers when they inevitably strike. Now the CRA has arrived , aiming to address these very issues from a top-down perspective.</description></item><item><title>A Blueprint for DevSecOps: Accelerating Federal Agencies with IBM and Nirmata</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-09-11-a-blueprint-for-devsecops-accelerating-federal-agencies-with-ibm-and-nirmata/</link><pubDate>Thu, 11 Sep 2025 21:51:25 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-09-11-a-blueprint-for-devsecops-accelerating-federal-agencies-with-ibm-and-nirmata/</guid><description>A Blueprint for DevSecOps: Accelerating Federal Agencies with IBM and Nirmata The Challenge: Navigating a Complex Landscape The Solution: The IBM PDE Factory The Power of Policy as Code A Cultural Shift: From Remediation to Creation In the rapidly evolving world of IT modernization, federal agencies face a unique set of challenges. They must navigate complex security mandates and legacy systems while striving for the agility and speed of modern software development. A recent webinar featuring experts from IBM Federal and Nirmata shed light on this very topic, offering a compelling vision for accelerating DevSecOps and ensuring security is a foundational element, not an afterthought. A poll conducted during the webinar revealed the top hurdles for federal agencies: a tie between manual processes and legacy systems and security and compliance mandates. This perfectly illustrates the central conflict. How do you move fast when everything is a manual, security-audited process? As Mark Wells, DevSecOps and IT Automation Practice Lead for IBM Federal, explained, this was the exact problem that led to the creation of the IBM PTE Factory. Born from the chaos of DevOps engineers “running around like chickens with their heads cut off,” the factory was designed to automate the deployment of infrastructure and development environments. The IBM PDE Factory is an asset—a platform and product engineering tool designed to deliver core services and support for software engineering. It’s built around a “start left” philosophy, meaning security is integrated from the very beginning of the process, not “shifted left” later. The factory’s core is a series of “builders” that automate critical tasks: Resource Builder: Ensures all container images and resources are certified and attested to, with near-zero vulnerabilities, before they are ever used. Platform Builder: Automates the creation of the entire cloud architecture. Security Builder: Deploys pre-configured bundles of security policies.</description></item><item><title>Kubernetes v1.34: Mutable CSI Node Allocatable Graduates to Beta</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-09-11-kubernetes-v1-34-mutable-csi-node-allocatable-graduates-to-beta/</link><pubDate>Thu, 11 Sep 2025 10:30:00 -0800</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-09-11-kubernetes-v1-34-mutable-csi-node-allocatable-graduates-to-beta/</guid><description>Kubernetes v1.34: Mutable CSI Node Allocatable Graduates to Beta Background Dynamically adapting CSI volume limits How it works Enabling the feature Example CSI driver configuration Immediate updates on attachment failures Getting started Next steps The functionality for CSI drivers to update information about attachable volume count on the nodes , first introduced as Alpha in Kubernetes v1.33, has graduated to Beta in the Kubernetes v1.34 release! This marks a significant milestone in enhancing the accuracy of stateful pod scheduling by reducing failures due to outdated attachable volume capacity information. Traditionally, Kubernetes CSI drivers report a static maximum volume attachment limit when initializing. However, actual attachment capacities can change during a node&amp;rsquo;s lifecycle for various reasons, such as: Manual or external operations attaching/detaching volumes outside of Kubernetes control. Dynamically attached network interfaces or specialized hardware (GPUs, NICs, etc. ) consuming available slots. Multi-driver scenarios, where one CSI driver’s operations affect available capacity reported by another. Static reporting can cause Kubernetes to schedule pods onto nodes that appear to have capacity but don&amp;rsquo;t, leading to pods stuck in a ContainerCreating state. ContainerCreating With this new feature, Kubernetes enables CSI drivers to dynamically adjust and report node attachment capacities at runtime. This ensures that the scheduler, as well as other components relying on this information, have the most accurate, up-to-date view of node capacity. Kubernetes supports two mechanisms for updating the reported node volume limits: Periodic Updates: CSI drivers specify an interval to periodically refresh the node&amp;rsquo;s allocatable capacity. Reactive Updates: An immediate update triggered when a volume attachment fails due to exhausted resources ( ResourceExhausted error). ResourceExhausted To use this beta feature, the MutableCSINodeAllocatableCount feature gate must be enabled in these components: MutableCSINodeAllocatableCount kube-apiserver kube-apiserver kubelet kubelet Below is an example of configuring a CSI driver to enable periodic updates every 60 seconds: apiVersion: storage.</description></item><item><title>Broadcom (VMware) Named a Leader in the 2025 GartnerⓇ Magic QuadrantTM for Distributed Hybrid Infrastructure for the 3rd Consecutive Year</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-09-11-broadcom-vmware-named-a-leader-in-the-2025-gartner-magic-quadranttm-for-distribu/</link><pubDate>Thu, 11 Sep 2025 13:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-09-11-broadcom-vmware-named-a-leader-in-the-2025-gartner-magic-quadranttm-for-distribu/</guid><description>Related Related Articles Broadcom (VMware) Named a Leader in the 2025 GartnerⓇ Magic QuadrantTM for Distributed Hybrid Infrastructure for the 3rd Consecutive Year FinOps in VMware Cloud Foundation Deploy VMware Private AI on HGX servers with Broadcom Ethernet Networking With the publication of the 2025 Gartner Ⓡ Magic Quadrant TM for Distributed Hybrid Infrastructure (DHI), Broadcom (VMware) has been recognized as a leader for the 3rd consecutive year.

VMware Cloud Foundation (VCF) brings together private cloud infrastructure with FinOps principles to help ensure financial accountability, operational visibility, and business alignment for all IT users. The FinOps framework in VCF enables enterprises to not only provision infrastructure but also optimize, govern, and allocate costs intelligently across developers and providers. In an era where IT infrastructure costs are rapidly escalating, particularly with the rise of AI initiatives, enterprise organizations demand greater control and visibility over their expenditures. This necessitates not only refined service metering and billing, but also the ability to accurately capture and view the Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) and overall expenses. Concurrently, IT teams face the challenge of optimizing infrastructure to reduce costs and promote resource reuse, while also refining service metering and billing for a diverse array of modern services, including VMs, AI services, database services, Kubernetes services, and storage services. VCF cost management monitors and controls infrastructure spend by improving transparency, enabling cost governance, and supporting accurate budgeting. Delivered through a single pane of glass, VCF enables cost visibility, analysis, budgeting, optimization, and ROI insights while enabling showback for transparency and chargeback with customizable billing models—empowering enterprises to manage expenses, ensure accountability, and compare costs against public cloud efficiently. VMware Cloud Foundation (VCF) brings robust chargeback capabilities that cater to the unique needs of both enterprises and cloud service providers. For enterprises, VCF enables internal IT teams to bill back projects and application groups based on the resources they consume, creating financial accountability and promoting efficient usage. On the other hand, cloud service providers can leverage the same framework to track, meter, and charge tenants for the services delivered, ensuring fairness and transparency. By combining metering with data- and logic-backed billing, VCF empowers providers to generate accurate, itemized bills while giving consumers confidence that they are only paying for what they use.</description></item><item><title>Navigating AI risk: Building a trusted foundation with Red Hat</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-09-11-navigating-ai-risk-building-a-trusted-foundation-with-red-hat/</link><pubDate>Thu, 11 Sep 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-09-11-navigating-ai-risk-building-a-trusted-foundation-with-red-hat/</guid><description>Navigating AI risk: Building a trusted foundation with Red Hat Understanding enterprise AI security risks Red Hat&amp;rsquo;s layered approach to AI security The proven backbone of Red Hat OpenShift A platform for what’s next with Red Hat OpenShift AI Best practices Hardening the AI platform and deployment pipelines Protecting active AI workloads and data Final thoughts Get started with AI Inference About the authors Martin Isaksson Christopher Nuland More like this Blog post Blog post Original podcast Original podcast Keep exploring Browse by channel Automation Artificial intelligence Open hybrid cloud Security Edge computing Infrastructure Applications Virtualization Share Red Hat helps organizations embrace AI innovation by providing a comprehensive and layered approach to security and safety across the entire AI lifecycle.

Considerations when migrating from a traditional hypervisor to OpenShift Virtualization include: Understanding VM dependencies: Discovering and managing interconnected VM configurations Encrypted disks and storage compatibility: Ensuring data security and storage interoperability Minimizing downtime: Executing migrations with minimal disruption to critical services Robust rollback planning: Developing and testing strategies for seamless recovery Integration with modern CI/CD pipelines: Incorporating migrated VMs into automated development and release workflows Both Ansible Automation Platform and OpenShift Virtualization help you meet these challenges.</description></item><item><title>The virtualization game has changed: A new playbook for IT leaders</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-09-11-the-virtualization-game-has-changed-a-new-playbook-for-it-leaders/</link><pubDate>Thu, 11 Sep 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-09-11-the-virtualization-game-has-changed-a-new-playbook-for-it-leaders/</guid><description>The virtualization game has changed: A new playbook for IT leaders A market in motion The strategic shift A new game plan for a new era Want guidance on other tech challenges? Red Hat OpenShift Virtualization Engine | Product Trial About the author Andrew Brown More like this Blog post Blog post Original podcast Keep exploring Browse by channel Automation Artificial intelligence Open hybrid cloud Security Edge computing Infrastructure Applications Virtualization Share In today&amp;rsquo;s business, success isn&amp;rsquo;t just about playing the game–it&amp;rsquo;s about having the right strategy to win. Like a top team constantly adapting its formation to a changing opponent, organisations are grappling with complex IT environments, rising costs, and the need to modernise for workloads like AI. The question is, how do we find a way forward that provides greater control and a clear path to innovation? The answer lies in how we approach virtualization. To help leaders understand how the situation has shifted, Red Hat released a report on the state of virtualization. It reveals critical insights into how forward-thinking organisations are harnessing a unified platform for virtualization and containers to become more agile and flexible. I&amp;rsquo;ve been discussing these very topics with our customers, partners, and peers for some time now, and the insights in this report are a perfect articulation of what I&amp;rsquo;ve seen firsthand: there is a widespread desire for a new playbook for the future of IT infrastructure. Our customers are asking for a platform that drives tangible change and positions them for ongoing success. What truly solidifies my understanding of the changing virtualization market is the sheer scale of the market movement revealed in the report. It&amp;rsquo;s one thing to know there&amp;rsquo;s a buzz about change, but it’s another to see the data: 70% of organisations have recently moved virtual machine (VM) workloads to a different or additional hypervisor—or are in the process of making a switch. This isn&amp;rsquo;t just contemplation, it&amp;rsquo;s a widespread reassessment of existing platforms driven by a fundamental belief that the existing strategy is no longer sufficient. Organisations are not just thinking about it, but are actively executing on a new virtualization strategy that addresses their primary pain points, including licensing costs (31%), and management complexity (31%). Vendor lock-in (28%) and concerns about the continued support of existing platforms (27%), along with confidence in long-term vision (24%), are also frequent topics.</description></item><item><title>Kubernetes v1.34: Use An Init Container To Define App Environment Variables</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-09-10-kubernetes-v1-34-use-an-init-container-to-define-app-environment-variables/</link><pubDate>Wed, 10 Sep 2025 10:30:00 -0800</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-09-10-kubernetes-v1-34-use-an-init-container-to-define-app-environment-variables/</guid><description>Kubernetes v1.34: Use An Init Container To Define App Environment Variables What’s this all about? How It Works A word on security Summary Kubernetes typically uses ConfigMaps and Secrets to set environment variables, which introduces additional API calls and complexity, For example, you need to separately manage the Pods of your workloads and their configurations, while ensuring orderly updates for both the configurations and the workload Pods. Alternatively, you might be using a vendor-supplied container that requires environment variables (such as a license key or a one-time token), but you don’t want to hard-code them or mount volumes just to get the job done. If that&amp;rsquo;s the situation you are in, you now have a new (alpha) way to achieve that. Provided you have the EnvFiles feature gate enabled across your cluster, you can tell the kubelet to load a container&amp;rsquo;s environment variables from a volume (the volume must be part of the Pod that the container belongs to). this feature gate allows you to load environment variables directly from a file in an emptyDir volume without actually mounting that file into the container. It’s a simple yet elegant solution to some surprisingly common problems. EnvFiles At its core, this feature allows you to point your container to a file, one generated by an initContainer , and have Kubernetes parse that file to set your environment variables. The file lives in an emptyDir volume (a temporary storage space that lasts as long as the pod does), Your main container doesn’t need to mount the volume. The kubelet will read the file and inject these variables when the container starts. initContainer emptyDir Here&amp;rsquo;s a simple example: apiVersion : v1 kind : Pod spec : initContainers : - name : generate-config image : busybox command : [ &amp;lsquo;sh&amp;rsquo; , &amp;lsquo;-c&amp;rsquo; , &amp;rsquo;echo &amp;ldquo;CONFIG_VAR=HELLO&amp;rdquo; &amp;gt; /config/config. env&amp;rsquo; ] volumeMounts : - name : config-volume mountPath : /config containers : - name : app-container image : gcr. io/distroless/static env : - name : CONFIG_VAR valueFrom : fileKeyRef : path : config.</description></item><item><title>Deploy VMware Private AI on HGX servers with Broadcom Ethernet Networking</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-09-10-deploy-vmware-private-ai-on-hgx-servers-with-broadcom-ethernet-networking/</link><pubDate>Wed, 10 Sep 2025 04:14:57 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-09-10-deploy-vmware-private-ai-on-hgx-servers-with-broadcom-ethernet-networking/</guid><description>What’s Covered in the White Paper?

What changed for us For a much deeper dive … Final thoughts Get started with AI Inference About the author Roberto Carratalá More like this Blog post Blog post Original podcast Original podcast Keep exploring Browse by channel Automation Artificial intelligence Open hybrid cloud Security Edge computing Infrastructure Applications Virtualization Share If you&amp;rsquo;ve ever worked for or with enterprise companies you know that, when it comes to software, whether it&amp;rsquo;s AI-powered or not, the stakes could not be higher. And that is the reason they invest heavily in making their production environments as bulletproof as possible. They will architect for high availability and disaster recovery, enforce strict service level agreements (SLAs), and build redundancy into every possible layer. But if their architecture doesn’t also account for the potential for human error , is any of it worth the effort? Time and again, we’ve seen catastrophic outages traced back to a wrong mouse click, a badly written command, or a rushed deployment. Let’s review a few of them: Amazon S3 outage (Feb 2017): An engineer mistyped a command intended to remove a few servers, instead taking down critical S3 subsystems. The disruption affected GitHub, Slack, and other big players, lasting several hours and costing billions of dollars in damages. Facebook global outage (Oct 2021): Engineers withdrew critical Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) routes during a backbone configuration change, causing Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp to vanish from the internet for nearly six hours, a lesson on how a single manual change can break world-class redundancy. CrowdStrike Falcon update meltdown (July 2024): A single defective configuration file shipped in an automated security-agent update sent millions of Windows machines into a reboot loop, grounding airlines, banks, and hospitals worldwide. Again, a preventable human mistake , just at internet scale. As a personal example, I once worked with a customer whose datacenter cleaning staff unplugged a production rack server to plug in a vacuum cleaner. That predictable and preventable mistake caused six hours of serious downtime (and I’m only being vague because the incident is recognizable). The solution would not be to fire the cleaner, but to install lockable power outlets, so critical equipment cannot be disconnected without a key.</description></item><item><title>Enhancing your migration experience with migration toolkit for virtualization 2.9's UI updates</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-09-10-enhancing-your-migration-experience-with-migration-toolkit-for-virtualization-2-/</link><pubDate>Wed, 10 Sep 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-09-10-enhancing-your-migration-experience-with-migration-toolkit-for-virtualization-2-/</guid><description>Enhancing your migration experience with migration toolkit for virtualization 2.9&amp;rsquo;s UI updates New features and highlights Overview page Migration plan creation wizard Monitoring experience Benefits Red Hat OpenShift Virtualization Engine | Product Trial About the authors Ethan Kim More like this Blog post Blog post Original podcast Keep exploring Browse by channel Automation Artificial intelligence Open hybrid cloud Security Edge computing Infrastructure Applications Virtualization Share Migration toolkit for virtualization 2.9 (MTV) release is here, and brings lots of new features to help make your virtual machine (VM) migration experience easier.

Red Hat has a bold vision to help enterprises bridge their existing world and the new world of AI: supporting any model, on any accelerator, on any cloud, powered by open source. At this year’s Red Hat Summit , we made dozens of announcements extending our AI portfolio and ecosystem partnerships. Since then, we are excited to have formed a collaboration with Great Wave AI, a UK-based provider of an agentic generative AI (gen AI) platform. Together we aim to combine the scale, security features and flexibility of Red Hat AI with Great Wave’s “consumption layer” for multi-agent orchestration, making AI more usable for organisations of all sizes. This collaboration provides Red Hat customers with the ability to add an agentic layer on top of our enterprise-ready open source AI platforms, making it easier for them to tailor AI capabilities to their organization. Why AI orchestration? I recently had the opportunity to catch up with Jack Perschke, co-founder and chief executive officer of Great Wave AI, and discuss some of the trends shaping AI at the moment and what the collaboration means for both our companies. According to Jack, large language models (LLMs) are “like crude oil” in that they’re valuable, but need refinement to become usable products. Great Wave acts as the refinery turning raw model capability into fit-for-purpose tools, using their choice of hosting provider or LLM vendor. Jack explains, “Our platform makes it easier to switch between models, test applications with new models and host your own to meet specific security needs. In an era where prompts and responses can’t be encrypted inside the model itself, the safest option is often running it in your own environment. Red Hat makes this possible.</description></item><item><title>Announcing Gateway API Support for DigitalOcean Kubernetes</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-09-09-announcing-gateway-api-support-for-digitalocean-kubernetes/</link><pubDate>Tue, 09 Sep 2025 21:28:56 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-09-09-announcing-gateway-api-support-for-digitalocean-kubernetes/</guid><description>Announcing Gateway API Support for DigitalOcean Kubernetes Key Benefits Why Move Beyond Ingress?

A major focus of this effort has been taming list requests, which have historically been a primary source of high memory usage and heavy load on the etcd datastore. With each release, we&amp;rsquo;ve chipped away at the problem, and today, we&amp;rsquo;re thrilled to announce the final major piece of this puzzle. etcd The snapshottable API server cache feature has graduated to Beta in Kubernetes v1.34, culminating a multi-release effort to allow virtually all read requests to be served directly from the API server&amp;rsquo;s cache. The path to the current state involved several key enhancements over recent releases that paved the way for today&amp;rsquo;s announcement. While the API server has long used a cache for performance, a key milestone was guaranteeing consistent reads of the latest data from it. This v1.31 enhancement allowed the watch cache to be used for strongly-consistent read requests for the first time, a huge win as it enabled filtered collections (e. g. &amp;ldquo;a list of pods bound to this node&amp;rdquo;) to be safely served from the cache instead of etcd, dramatically reducing its load for common workloads. Another key improvement was tackling the problem of memory spikes when transmitting large responses. The streaming encoder, introduced in v1.33, allowed the API server to send list items one by one, rather than buffering the entire multi-gigabyte response in memory. This made the memory cost of sending a response predictable and minimal, regardless of its size.</description></item><item><title>Unlocking the Power of GenAI</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-09-09-unlocking-the-power-of-genai/</link><pubDate>Tue, 09 Sep 2025 14:33:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-09-09-unlocking-the-power-of-genai/</guid><description>Related Articles Unlocking the Power of GenAI Analyst Insight Series: Conquering Complexity—the Bedrock of Successful Platform Engineering Transfer VMware Cloud Foundation (VCF) Operations Integration SDK Builds to a Private Container Registry in the deployed VCF Operations Environment The future of technology is no longer a distant dream, but a reality that’s rapidly unfolding before our eyes.

By integrating Rekor-monitor, we can extend the principles of supply chain security by actively verifying the integrity of the private Rekor logs. This powerful combination of a verifiable log and continuous monitoring creates a robust audit trail, ensuring that the software supply chain remains secure, transparent, and compliant. Rekor-monitor, also known as Rekor Log Monitor, is a tool that continuously checks the integrity of Rekor transparency logs. It is designed to run periodically at a specified interval to verify that the Rekor transparency log remains append-only and immutable. For easy observability, the monitor also exposes Prometheus based metrics, which can be used by monitoring systems to create dashboards and set up alerts based on key metrics. For example, you could configure an alert to notify you immediately if a consistency check fails, indicating a potential compromise of the log.</description></item><item><title>Senior Machine Learning Engineer on Red Hat's AI Inference Team</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-09-09-senior-machine-learning-engineer-on-red-hat-s-ai-inference-team/</link><pubDate>Tue, 09 Sep 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-09-09-senior-machine-learning-engineer-on-red-hat-s-ai-inference-team/</guid><description>Senior Machine Learning Engineer on Red Hat&amp;rsquo;s AI Inference Team Red Hat Learning Subscription | Product Trial About the authors Brian Dellabetta Holly Bailey Vanshika Arora More like this Blog post Blog post Original podcast Original podcast Keep exploring Browse by channel Automation Artificial intelligence Open hybrid cloud Security Edge computing Infrastructure Applications Virtualization Share Brian D. is a senior machine learning (ML) engineer on our AI Inference team, which is part of the broader AI Engineering team at Red Hat. Based remotely in Chicago, Brian helps maintain LLM Compressor , a key component of vLLM (an open source inference server originally developed at UC Berkeley, and now supported by a global community). vLLM is designed to make AI inference —in other words, responses from models—more efficient. Through LLM Compressor, Brian and his team make it possible to optimize and deploy LLMs so they run faster, consume less energy, and operate on fewer GPUs, without compromising performance. The resulting impact? Lower computational barriers to working with AI—which, in turn, opens the door for more organizations, researchers, and innovators to use these models in meaningful ways. We sat down with Brian to learn more about his journey, his team, and life as a ML engineer. Tell us about your journey to Red Hat and AI I joined Red Hat in January through the acquisition of Neural Magic. I was actually in the middle of the interview process with Neural Magic when the acquisition was announced. It was great timing: my first week was the same week the entire Neural Magic team met in Boston for Red Hat’s new hire orientation. I’ve been in the AI/ML field for several years, but I’m still new to this role at Red Hat. My career path has been a gradual shift toward AI.</description></item><item><title>Analyst Insight Series: Conquering Complexity—the Bedrock of Successful Platform Engineering</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-09-08-analyst-insight-series-conquering-complexity-the-bedrock-of-successful-platform-/</link><pubDate>Mon, 08 Sep 2025 22:07:04 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-09-08-analyst-insight-series-conquering-complexity-the-bedrock-of-successful-platform-/</guid><description>About the Author Related Articles Analyst Insight Series: Conquering Complexity—the Bedrock of Successful Platform Engineering Transfer VMware Cloud Foundation (VCF) Operations Integration SDK Builds to a Private Container Registry in the deployed VCF Operations Environment VMware Cloud Foundation - Cloud on Your Terms Complexity has always been a core challenge when deploying cloud-native software such as Kubernetes. By extension, it is also a key consideration when implementing platform engineering practices and processes to manage cloud-native environments. To overcome the array of complexity-related challenges across infrastructures, applications, tools, and teams, enterprise organizations must enable simplified operations and maintain consistency with federated platforms that can integrate and evolve with a variety of technologies. Consolidated, unified platforms that support integration across venues and software components are critical to overcoming complexity. For Kubernetes, this also means supporting the many different open source components that make up an effective deployment, including orchestration, monitoring and observability, and security functions. Further, as cloud-native constructs and containers are deployed across a broader swath of enterprise applications, teams must centrally and consistently manage both container-based and VM-based applications on a single platform. Much like DevOps, platform engineering relies on breaking down silos within an organization to support teams and personas beyond software developers and IT admins (e. g. , cloud admins, platform engineers, security teams) with self-service capabilities, as well as aligned objectives and incentives to foster collaboration. Comprehensive, end-to-end platforms that seamlessly connect compute, storage, networking, and security resources with unified lifecycle management, and that also facilitate integrations across the software development and deployment process, can help enterprises to better support their broad array of applications and teams. This can help address complexity issues by allowing teams to centrally and consistently manage platforms using a common skillset, further reducing costs by reducing the need for new hires and talent acquisition. Conquering complexity and integration challenges associated with platform engineering can enable improved developer productivity, faster delivery time, improved security and higher-quality code—sought-after benefits that are frequently identified in our Voice of the Enterprise surveys.</description></item><item><title>Kubernetes v1.34: VolumeAttributesClass for Volume Modification GA</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-09-08-kubernetes-v1-34-volumeattributesclass-for-volume-modification-ga/</link><pubDate>Mon, 08 Sep 2025 10:30:00 -0800</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-09-08-kubernetes-v1-34-volumeattributesclass-for-volume-modification-ga/</guid><description>Kubernetes v1.34: VolumeAttributesClass for Volume Modification GA What is VolumeAttributesClass? What is new from Beta to GA Cancel support from infeasible errors Quota support based on scope Drivers support VolumeAttributesClass Contact The VolumeAttributesClass API, which empowers users to dynamically modify volume attributes, has officially graduated to General Availability (GA) in Kubernetes v1.34. This marks a significant milestone, providing a robust and stable way to tune your persistent storage directly within Kubernetes. At its core, VolumeAttributesClass is a cluster-scoped resource that defines a set of mutable parameters for a volume. Think of it as a &amp;ldquo;profile&amp;rdquo; for your storage, allowing cluster administrators to expose different quality-of-service (QoS) levels or performance tiers. Users can then specify a volumeAttributesClassName in their PersistentVolumeClaim (PVC) to indicate which class of attributes they desire. The magic happens through the Container Storage Interface (CSI): when a PVC referencing a VolumeAttributesClass is updated, the associated CSI driver interacts with the underlying storage system to apply the specified changes to the volume. volumeAttributesClassName This means you can now: Dynamically scale performance: Increase IOPS or throughput for a busy database, or reduce it for a less critical application. Optimize costs: Adjust attributes on the fly to match your current needs, avoiding over-provisioning. Simplify operations: Manage volume modifications directly within the Kubernetes API, rather than relying on external tools or manual processes. There are two major enhancements from beta. To improve resilience and user experience, the GA release introduces explicit cancel support when a requested volume modification becomes infeasible. If the underlying storage system or CSI driver indicates that the requested changes cannot be applied (e.</description></item><item><title>Accelerate your Red Hat Enterprise Linux 10 skills with Red Hat Learning Subscription</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-09-08-accelerate-your-red-hat-enterprise-linux-10-skills-with-red-hat-learning-subscri/</link><pubDate>Mon, 08 Sep 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-09-08-accelerate-your-red-hat-enterprise-linux-10-skills-with-red-hat-learning-subscri/</guid><description>Accelerate your Red Hat Enterprise Linux 10 skills with Red Hat Learning Subscription Introducing Lessons: Your path to accelerated skills development Where to start Red Hat Enterprise Linux technical overview (RH024) New features in Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RH304) Red Hat system administration (RH124) Accelerate your skills Red Hat Enterprise Linux | Product trial About the author Mary Margaret Barnes More like this Blog post Blog post Blog post Keep exploring Browse by channel Automation Artificial intelligence Open hybrid cloud Security Edge computing Infrastructure Applications Virtualization Share Announced at Red Hat Summit earlier this year, Red Hat Enterprise Linux 10 is designed to meet the demands of hybrid cloud, automation, and AI-driven IT environments.

The community of practice fosters cross-functional communication, standardizes automation practices, and accelerates innovation through the sharing of knowledge, ideas, and lessons learned. It serves as a hub across disparate yet adjacent teams for the reuse of solutions and the development of consistent operational models. Note: The terms center of excellence, community of excellence, and community of practice are often used interchangeably within the industry. You can learn more about how Red Hat differentiates between a center of excellence and a community of practice in this blog. Regardless of terminology used, what&amp;rsquo;s most important is to focus on the right approaches, activities, and outcomes. Recently, Red Hat partnered with a government organization to establish a structured automation community of practice that would unify automation efforts across disparate technical teams. Initial challenges Before the implementation of the community of practice, the organization experienced significant challenges due to a lack of standardization, including redundant automation development use cases, minimal cross-team collaboration and knowledge sharing, and increased time and budget costs associated with supporting multiple tools and frameworks. Once the community of practice was in place, designated representatives from different domains began meeting regularly to: Share automation progress, blockers, and lessons learned. Collaboratively troubleshoot and review each other’s work. Align on reusable automation content and development standards.

But running an outdated version of any operating system can expose your organization to security risks and prevent you from leveraging the latest features and performance improvements. We know it can sometimes be challenging and time-consuming to stay updated, so in this article I explain the RHEL lifecycle , the importance of staying current, and your options for upgrading. Every version of RHEL has a lifecycle that defines the level of support it receives over time. We can easily summarize its lifecycle as divided into three main phases: Full support phase: During this phase, your RHEL system receives all security updates, bug fixes, and new features. This is the ideal phase for your production systems to be in. Maintenance support phase: In this phase, Red Hat provides critical and important security updates and urgent bug fixes. However, during maintenance support, no new features or hardware enablement are provided. Extended life phase (ELP): After the maintenance support phase, your RHEL version enters the extended life phase. During this time, you have access to a limited set of software maintenance services. RHEL is used in a diverse range of environments, asd sometimes there are specific scenarios that require special attention. For example, you may be involved with: Third-party software vendors certifying and supporting specific RHEL minor versions.</description></item><item><title>Taming hybrid cloud complexity: A path to true agility</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-09-08-taming-hybrid-cloud-complexity-a-path-to-true-agility/</link><pubDate>Mon, 08 Sep 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-09-08-taming-hybrid-cloud-complexity-a-path-to-true-agility/</guid><description>Taming hybrid cloud complexity: A path to true agility Learn more about Red Hat OpenShift for Cloud-Native Application Platforms Want guidance on other tech challenges?

For many enterprises, the primary source of that complexity is the struggle to manage containerized applications at scale across diverse environments—from on-premises data centers to multiple public clouds. This fragmentation can lead to inconsistent operations and vendor lock-in, which stifles agility and innovation. As we navigate the era of AI, IT leaders need a unified, predictable way to manage it all so that your teams can focus on higher-value work. I&amp;rsquo;ve had the unique opportunity to see this problem from both sides. In my previous roles leading customer-facing teams, I saw firsthand how our customers leveraged Red Hat OpenShift to tackle their most complex challenges, such as streamlining their hybrid cloud experiences and reducing operational complexity. It was profoundly rewarding to see them use our platform to break free from the status quo. Now, as the CIO of Red Hat, my perspective has shifted to that of an internal customer. I see the immense value of OpenShift even more clearly because we also use it to run Red Hat’s business. We are our own customer zero, not because our leadership team mandates it, but because the product works for us. Our experience has been a testament to the platform&amp;rsquo;s power to create consistency across our hybrid cloud environment, which has been critical for managing our global operations. Our teams have seen significant improvements, including shorter cycle times from code to production and better standardization of application architectures. By using OpenShift, our applications have improved cloud agility, allowing them to move across our hybrid cloud environment without concern for the underlying infrastructure.</description></item><item><title>Why upgrade to Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9.6 or 10 now</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-09-08-why-upgrade-to-red-hat-enterprise-linux-9-6-or-10-now/</link><pubDate>Mon, 08 Sep 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-09-08-why-upgrade-to-red-hat-enterprise-linux-9-6-or-10-now/</guid><description>Why upgrade to Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9.6 or 10 now RHEL Lightspeed Image mode Post-quantum cryptography RHEL lifecycle Red Hat Enterprise Linux | Product trial About the author Gil Cattelain More like this Blog post Blog post Original podcast Original podcast Keep exploring Browse by channel Automation Artificial intelligence Open hybrid cloud Security Edge computing Infrastructure Applications Virtualization Share My name is Gil Cattelain, and I&amp;rsquo;m a Product Marketing Manager here at Red Hat.

Acknowledgments Get involved In Kubernetes v1.34, the Pod replacement policy feature has reached general availability (GA). This blog post describes the Pod replacement policy feature and how to use it in your Jobs. By default, the Job controller immediately recreates Pods as soon as they fail or begin terminating (when they have a deletion timestamp). As a result, while some Pods are terminating, the total number of running Pods for a Job can temporarily exceed the specified parallelism. For Indexed Jobs, this can even mean multiple Pods running for the same index at the same time. This behavior works fine for many workloads, but it can cause problems in certain cases. For example, popular machine learning frameworks like TensorFlow and JAX expect exactly one Pod per worker index. If two Pods run at the same time, you might encounter errors such as: /job:worker/task:4: Duplicate task registration with task_name=/job:worker/replica:0/task:4 /job:worker/task:4: Duplicate task registration with task_name=/job:worker/replica:0/task:4 Additionally, starting replacement Pods before the old ones fully terminate can lead to: Scheduling delays by kube-scheduler as the nodes remain occupied. Unnecessary cluster scale-ups to accommodate the replacement Pods. Temporary bypassing of quota checks by workload orchestrators like Kueue. With Pod replacement policy, Kubernetes gives you control over when the control plane replaces terminating Pods, helping you avoid these issues. This enhancement means that Jobs in Kubernetes have an optional field.</description></item><item><title>Beyond the docs: Kartik's journey to Brno and Red Hat</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-09-05-beyond-the-docs-kartik-s-journey-to-brno-and-red-hat/</link><pubDate>Fri, 05 Sep 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-09-05-beyond-the-docs-kartik-s-journey-to-brno-and-red-hat/</guid><description>Beyond the docs: Kartik&amp;rsquo;s journey to Brno and Red Hat Red Hat Learning Subscription | Product Trial About the authors Holly Bailey Vanshika Arora More like this Blog post Blog post Blog post Keep exploring Browse by channel Automation Artificial intelligence Open hybrid cloud Security Edge computing Infrastructure Applications Virtualization Share We recently caught up with Kartikeya Baid Dwivedi (known as Kartik), a longtime Red Hatter with a varied career path and a passion for shaping great user experiences.

But here’s what’s truly fascinating: the benefits of private cloud aren’t just about the technology—they are about deployment maturity which also brings along people and process. When we analyzed responses through the lens of cloud maturity, a striking pattern emerged that reveals why some enterprises are pulling dramatically ahead of their peers. Enterprises that are mature in their cloud journey experience significantly superior results in strategic impact and operational excellence. They are investing in their infrastructure to drive business goals: 59% are increasing their private cloud investments, compared to 38% of developing-stage peers 60% rank private cloud workloads as their top IT priority, compared to 41% of developing-stage peers 90%+ report satisfaction in infrastructure operations, application deployment, security and compliance, compared to 50-65% satisfaction for developing-stage peers Perhaps most telling is the workload repatriation trend we discovered. Mature enterprises are 3x more likely to have repatriated workloads from public cloud , with 50% having brought modern, cloud-native applications back to private infrastructure. This isn’t about reversing failed migrations—it’s a deliberate, strategic move driven by heightened security concerns, rising costs, and the growing demands of modern workloads like AI. Our research identified six critical dimensions that determine cloud maturity progress across people, process and technology: Workload diversity – Successfully running both traditional and modern applications Self-service provisioning – Enabling tenant self-provisioning via catalogs and APIs Policy-based guardrails – Implementing automated governance for security and compliance Cost transparency – Providing chargeback/showback information to internal customers Platform model – Organizing around platform teams vs.</description></item><item><title>PSI Metrics for Kubernetes Graduates to Beta</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-09-04-psi-metrics-for-kubernetes-graduates-to-beta/</link><pubDate>Thu, 04 Sep 2025 10:30:00 -0800</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-09-04-psi-metrics-for-kubernetes-graduates-to-beta/</guid><description>PSI Metrics for Kubernetes Graduates to Beta What is Pressure Stall Information (PSI)? PSI metrics in Kubernetes How to enable PSI metrics What&amp;rsquo;s next? As Kubernetes clusters grow in size and complexity, understanding the health and performance of individual nodes becomes increasingly critical. We are excited to announce that as of Kubernetes v1.34, Pressure Stall Information (PSI) Metrics has graduated to Beta. Pressure Stall Information (PSI) is a feature of the Linux kernel (version 4.20 and later) that provides a canonical way to quantify pressure on infrastructure resources, in terms of whether demand for a resource exceeds current supply. It moves beyond simple resource utilization metrics and instead measures the amount of time that tasks are stalled due to resource contention. This is a powerful way to identify and diagnose resource bottlenecks that can impact application performance. PSI exposes metrics for CPU, memory, and I/O, categorized as either some or full pressure: some full some full These metrics are aggregated over 10-second, 1-minute, and 5-minute rolling windows, providing a comprehensive view of resource pressure over time. With the KubeletPSI feature gate enabled, the kubelet can now collect PSI metrics from the Linux kernel and expose them through two channels: the Summary API and the /metrics/cadvisor Prometheus endpoint. This allows you to monitor and alert on resource pressure at the node, pod, and container level. KubeletPSI /metrics/cadvisor The following new metrics are available in Prometheus exposition format via /metrics/cadvisor : /metrics/cadvisor container_pressure_cpu_stalled_seconds_total container_pressure_cpu_stalled_seconds_total container_pressure_cpu_waiting_seconds_total container_pressure_cpu_waiting_seconds_total container_pressure_memory_stalled_seconds_total container_pressure_memory_stalled_seconds_total container_pressure_memory_waiting_seconds_total container_pressure_memory_waiting_seconds_total container_pressure_io_stalled_seconds_total container_pressure_io_stalled_seconds_total container_pressure_io_waiting_seconds_total container_pressure_io_waiting_seconds_total These metrics, along with the data from the Summary API, provide a granular view of resource pressure, enabling you to pinpoint the source of performance issues and take corrective action. For example, you can use these metrics to: Identify memory leaks: A steadily increasing some pressure for memory can indicate a memory leak in an application. some Optimize resource requests and limits: By understanding the resource pressure of your workloads, you can more accurately tune their resource requests and limits. Autoscale workloads: You can use PSI metrics to trigger autoscaling events, ensuring that your workloads have the resources they need to perform optimally.</description></item><item><title>Kubernetes v1.34: Service Account Token Integration for Image Pulls Graduates to Beta</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-09-03-kubernetes-v1-34-service-account-token-integration-for-image-pulls-graduates-to-/</link><pubDate>Wed, 03 Sep 2025 10:30:00 -0800</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-09-03-kubernetes-v1-34-service-account-token-integration-for-image-pulls-graduates-to-/</guid><description>Kubernetes v1.34: Service Account Token Integration for Image Pulls Graduates to Beta What&amp;rsquo;s new in beta? Required cacheType field Isolated image pull credentials How it works Configuration Image pull flow Audience restriction Getting started with beta Prerequisites Migration from alpha Example setup What&amp;rsquo;s next? Call to action How to get involved The Kubernetes community continues to advance security best practices by reducing reliance on long-lived credentials. Following the successful alpha release in Kubernetes v1.33 , Service Account Token Integration for Kubelet Credential Providers has now graduated to beta in Kubernetes v1.34, bringing us closer to eliminating long-lived image pull secrets from Kubernetes clusters. This enhancement allows credential providers to use workload-specific service account tokens to obtain registry credentials, providing a secure, ephemeral alternative to traditional image pull secrets. The beta graduation brings several important changes that make the feature more robust and production-ready: cacheType Breaking change from alpha : The cacheType field is required in the credential provider configuration when using service account tokens. This field is new in beta and must be specified to ensure proper caching behavior. cacheType # CAUTION: this is not a complete configuration example, just a reference for the &amp;rsquo;tokenAttributes. cacheType&amp;rsquo; field. tokenAttributes : serviceAccountTokenAudience : &amp;ldquo;my-registry-audience&amp;rdquo; cacheType : &amp;ldquo;ServiceAccount&amp;rdquo; # Required field in beta requireServiceAccount : true # CAUTION: this is not a complete configuration example, just a reference for the &amp;rsquo;tokenAttributes. cacheType&amp;rsquo; field. tokenAttributes : serviceAccountTokenAudience : &amp;ldquo;my-registry-audience&amp;rdquo; cacheType : &amp;ldquo;ServiceAccount&amp;rdquo; # Required field in beta requireServiceAccount : true Choose between two caching strategies: Token : Cache credentials per service account token (use when credential lifetime is tied to the token). This is useful when the credential provider transforms the service account token into registry credentials with the same lifetime as the token, or when registries support Kubernetes service account tokens directly. Note: The kubelet cannot send service account tokens directly to registries; credential provider plugins are needed to transform tokens into the username/password format expected by registries.</description></item><item><title>Sharks of DigitalOcean: Archana Kamath, Senior Director, IaaS</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-09-03-sharks-of-digitalocean-archana-kamath-senior-director-iaas/</link><pubDate>Wed, 03 Sep 2025 04:09:34 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-09-03-sharks-of-digitalocean-archana-kamath-senior-director-iaas/</guid><description>Sharks of DigitalOcean: Archana Kamath, Senior Director, IaaS What makes DigitalOcean the right place for you?

It&amp;rsquo;s an end-to-end solution that provides data confidentiality on cloud platforms by isolating a cluster from its underlying infrastructure. In a confidential cluster, all nodes run on top of confidential virtual machines (cVM). Before a node can join the cluster and access secrets, the platform and environment&amp;rsquo;s authenticity are verified through remote attestation. This process involves communication with a trusted remote server. Confidential Clusters enables you to use Red Hat OpenShift, a trusted platform to develop, modernize, and deploy applications at scale and leverage the convenience and flexibility of the cloud services without compromising on data security. This is critical for industries such as financial services, health care, and government that need to adhere to the regulatory requirements such as the European Digital Operational Resiliency Act (DORA). The general availability of OpenShift confidential nodes on cVM is now offered with AMD SEV-SNP and Intel TDX integration on Google Cloud Platform (GCP), as well as with AMD SEV-SNP on Azure in OpenShift version 4.19. Support for Intel TDX on Azure will be available in version 4.20 and above. Additionally, the integration of remote attestation is currently under development and will be included in future OpenShift releases. It’s a complex technology, but that doesn&amp;rsquo;t mean it&amp;rsquo;s complex to set up.

Introducing AI system cards Looking forward Learn more Get started with AI Inference About the author Huzaifa Sidhpurwala More like this Blog post Blog post Blog post Keep exploring Browse by channel Automation Artificial intelligence Open hybrid cloud Security Edge computing Infrastructure Applications Virtualization Share AI is one of the most significant innovations to emerge in the last 5 years. Generative AI (gen AI) models are now smaller, faster, and cheaper to run. They can solve mathematical problems, analyze situations, and even reason about cause‑and‑effect relationships to generate insights that once required human expertise. On its own, an AI model is merely a set of trained weights and mathematical operations, an impressive engine, but one sitting idle on a test bench. Business value only emerges when that model is embedded within a complete AI system: data pipelines feed it clean, context‑rich inputs, application logic orchestrates pre‑ and post‑processing, guardrails and monitoring enforce safety, security, and compliance, and user interfaces deliver insights through chatbots, dashboards, or automated actions. In practice, end users engage with systems, not raw models, which is why a single foundational model can power hundreds of tailored solutions across domains. Without the surrounding infrastructure of an AI system, even the most advanced model remains untapped potential rather than a tool that solves real‑world problems. AI model cards are files that accompany and describe the model, helping AI system developers make informed decisions about which model to choose for their applications. Model cards present a concise, standardized snapshot of each model’s strengths, limitations, and training information, summarizing performance metrics across key benchmarks, detailing the data and methodology used for training and evaluation, highlighting known biases and failure modes, and spelling out licensing terms and governance contacts. With this information in one place, it&amp;rsquo;s easier to assess whether a model aligns with accuracy targets, fairness requirements, deployment constraints, and compliance obligations, reducing integration risk and accelerating responsible adoption. In November 2024, we authored a paper addressing the rapidly evolving ecosystem of publicly available AI models and their potential implications for security and safety. In this paper we proposed standardization of model cards and extensions to include safety, security, and data governance and pedigree information.</description></item><item><title>Understanding AI agent types: A guide to categorizing complexity</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-09-03-understanding-ai-agent-types-a-guide-to-categorizing-complexity/</link><pubDate>Wed, 03 Sep 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-09-03-understanding-ai-agent-types-a-guide-to-categorizing-complexity/</guid><description>Understanding AI agent types: A guide to categorizing complexity 1.

It monitors, manages, and optimizes IT operations by collecting data using management packs. VCF Operations includes built-in packs for components like vCenter and VCF. Additionally, it provides tools—a management pack builder and an Integration SDK—that enable users to develop custom management packs for monitoring applications and infrastructure components not covered by the built-in options. These user-developed management packs can be uploaded and deployed to specific environments, allowing organizations to tailor their monitoring capabilities and integrate diverse technologies within their VCF ecosystem. The Integration SDK provides tools and libraries in Python and Java to aid in development of management packs to add custom objects, data, and relationships from an endpoint into VCF Operations. The Integration SDK generates containerized management packs and hence requires a container registry for its storage and retrieval. This container registry must be accessible by the VCF Operations Cloud Proxies to download the container. By default, the Integration SDK’s build environment’s container registry must be accessible by the VCF Operations Cloud proxies in the intended deployment environment. In most scenarios, the container registry used by the Integration SDK’s build environment is accessible by the VCF Operations Cloud Proxies in the deployed environment. However, in the following situations, Integration SDKs build environment’s container registry may not be accessible by the VCF Operations Cloud proxies in the intended deployment environment: VCF Operations has been deployed in an air-gapped environment and there is no connectivity to the internet to access public container registry.

Cache-aware workload placement Use cases Enabling the feature Further reading Getting involved A new CPU Manager Static Policy Option called prefer-align-cpus-by-uncorecache was introduced in Kubernetes v1.32 as an alpha feature, and has graduated to beta in Kubernetes v1.34. This CPU Manager Policy Option is designed to optimize performance for specific workloads running on processors with a split uncore cache architecture. In this article, I&amp;rsquo;ll explain what that means and why it&amp;rsquo;s useful. prefer-align-cpus-by-uncorecache Until relatively recently, nearly all mainstream computer processors had a monolithic last-level-cache cache that was shared across every core in a multiple CPU package. This monolithic cache is also referred to as uncore cache (because it is not linked to a specific core), or as Level 3 cache. As well as the Level 3 cache, there is other cache, commonly called Level 1 and Level 2 cache, that is associated with a specific CPU core. In order to reduce access latency between the CPU cores and their cache, recent AMD64 and ARM architecture based processors have introduced a split uncore cache architecture, where the last-level-cache is divided into multiple physical caches, that are aligned to specific CPU groupings within the physical package. The shorter distances within the CPU package help to reduce latency. Kubernetes is able to place workloads in a way that accounts for the cache topology within the CPU package(s). The matrix below shows the CPU-to-CPU latency measured in nanoseconds (lower is better) when passing a packet between CPUs, via its cache coherence protocol on a processor that uses split uncore cache. In this example, the processor package consists of 2 uncore caches. Each uncore cache serves 8 CPU cores.</description></item><item><title>Single Sign-On is Now Available, Strengthening Security and Simplifying Authentication</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-09-02-single-sign-on-is-now-available-strengthening-security-and-simplifying-authentic/</link><pubDate>Tue, 02 Sep 2025 15:43:19 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-09-02-single-sign-on-is-now-available-strengthening-security-and-simplifying-authentic/</guid><description>Single Sign-On is Now Available, Strengthening Security and Simplifying Authentication Single Sign-On is Now Available, Strengthening Security and Simplifying Authentication Why Single Sign-On matters How Single Sign-On can benefit your business How SSO on DigitalOcean works Get started with SSO on DigitalOcean About the author Try DigitalOcean for free Related Articles Announcing OpenAI gpt-oss Models on the DigitalOcean Gradientâ¢ AI Platform Build smarter AI agents: new tools now available for the DigitalOcean Gradientâ¢ AI Platform Introducing GPU Droplets accelerated by NVIDIA HGX H200 By Nicole Ghalwash Published: September 2, 2025 3 min read Good news: Single Sign-On (SSO) is now available for all DigitalOcean customers via Okta OpenID Connect (OIDC). Single Sign-On represents a major step forward in strengthening security, simplifying user management, and empowering teams to be more productive on DigitalOcean. For growing teams, managing user accounts across multiple platforms can quickly become a challenge. Password resets, manual onboarding, and offboarding all add up, not just for the IT teamâbut developers feel it too in terms of lost productivity. That means: No more juggling multiple usernames and passwords. No more juggling multiple usernames and passwords. Centralized access management that scales with your team. No more wasting time being locked out of critical apps. Stronger, consistent security across your entire toolchain. As organizations grow, managing user access across multiple tools and platforms can become complex, time-consuming, and costly. Single Sign-On solves this problem by allowing employees to securely access all their applications with a single set of credentials.

According to a 2025 BARC study , 84% of surveyed companies view data sovereignty as a central point of their strategy, and 70 percent report significantly increased relevance in the past one to two years. Meanwhile, industry analyst firm Gartner forecasts the sovereign cloud IaaS market will be worth $169 billion in 2028 , up from $37 billion last year. Different countries and organisations are adopting different approaches to digital and cloud sovereignty, some are cautiously waiting and watching to see how things shake out, others are acting fast. While there remains a certain degree of uncertainty over exactly what digital and cloud sovereignty looks like, most industry watchers agree that it will be ‘need to have’ rather than ‘nice to have. ’ For a broader perspective on digital sovereignty, we caught up with Red Hat country and regional leaders across Europe to test the waters in local markets. Gregor von Jagow, Country Manager, Germany: “We’re seeing demand across all sectors. ” Germany has long prioritized digital sovereignty, partly due to the cautious nature of its businesses. With geopolitical tensions and market consolidation, local cloud providers play a vital role. We partner with local players like IONOS and StackIT (a subsidiary of Schwarz Group) that are driving the sovereignty conversation in Germany. These providers are often best positioned to deliver the level of control and adherence to local regulations that truly define sovereign cloud solutions for customers. We’re seeing demand across all sectors, not just government.</description></item><item><title>Protect and unify with Commvault and Red Hat OpenShift: A modern approach to disaster recovery for VMs and containers</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-09-02-protect-and-unify-with-commvault-and-red-hat-openshift-a-modern-approach-to-disa/</link><pubDate>Tue, 02 Sep 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-09-02-protect-and-unify-with-commvault-and-red-hat-openshift-a-modern-approach-to-disa/</guid><description>Protect and unify with Commvault and Red Hat OpenShift: A modern approach to disaster recovery for VMs and containers A unified approach to backup and recovery Take the next step in your modernization journey Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform | Product Trial About the author Dan Bettinger More like this Blog post Blog post Blog post Keep exploring Browse by channel Automation Artificial intelligence Open hybrid cloud Security Edge computing Infrastructure Applications Virtualization Share The path to modernization isn&amp;rsquo;t always the least distance between two points. As enterprises embrace containerization for speed and scalability, a significant number of business-critical workloads continue to run on virtual machines (VM). Managing these two distinct environments is complex enough as it is, but then there&amp;rsquo;s also disaster recovery. How do you ensure rapid, reliable recovery for both platforms without doubling complexity and cost? What if you could unify your virtualized and containerized workloads on a single, modern platform with a more consistent, effective strategy for backup and disaster recovery? Red Hat OpenShift Virtualization enables organizations to do just that. It&amp;rsquo;s an included feature of Red Hat OpenShift that allows you to run and manage VMs and containers on the same Kubernetes-based platform. This modern approach streamlines IT infrastructure, but it&amp;rsquo;s the ability to protect it that brings peace of mind. Commvault has long supported container backup and disaster recovery on Red Hat OpenShift. Now Commvault is extending its support for Red Hat OpenShift to include Red Hat OpenShift Virtualization so that the same unified platform now also protects VMs running alongside containers. Specifically Commvault Long-Term Support Release 11.40 and Commvault Innovation Release 11.42 will support the versions of OpenShift Virtualization that are part of Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 4.18 and 4.19. For years, IT leaders have struggled with a fragmented approach to disaster recovery. Using separate backup tools for VMs and containers creates operational silos, increases the risk of data loss, and complicates recovery efforts when a disaster (such as a ransomware attack) occurs. With Commvault’s enterprise-grade data protection now extended to VMs running on Red Hat OpenShift Virtualization, you can finally implement a single, cohesive backup and recovery strategy.</description></item><item><title>The Metadata Assistant: How Red Hat is using generative AI to make web content easier to find and use</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-09-02-the-metadata-assistant-how-red-hat-is-using-generative-ai-to-make-web-content-ea/</link><pubDate>Tue, 02 Sep 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-09-02-the-metadata-assistant-how-red-hat-is-using-generative-ai-to-make-web-content-ea/</guid><description>The Metadata Assistant: How Red Hat is using generative AI to make web content easier to find and use Facing challenges with metadata accuracy How Red Hat&amp;rsquo;s Metadata Assistant helps How it works: Relieving Red Hatters from long forms and tedious tasks Conclusion Get started with AI Inference About the authors Anna McHugh Gail Vadia More like this Blog post Blog post Blog post Keep exploring Browse by channel Automation Artificial intelligence Open hybrid cloud Security Edge computing Infrastructure Applications Virtualization Share Most of us rely on good web metadata every day, perhaps hundreds of times a day, without ever realizing it. While we don’t all see metadata, it’s present on every webpage, providing details for categorizing content. Search and information retrieval software—from content management systems and search engines to generative AI (gen AI) chatbots—all depend on metadata to categorize, interpret, and display content to users. In some ways, metadata is like the classification system librarians use to place books on shelves so that visitors can find them. Much like a library catalog, good web metadata makes content easier to find and use because it has consistent, meaningful labels. At Red Hat, we maintain dozens of websites with tens of thousands of pages and millions of metadata selections. To help manage it all, we’ve developed a new internal generative AI (gen AI) tool: the Metadata Assistant.

Creating a pipeline (and then what?) Cool new things in data science pipelines (from Kubeflow Pipelines 2.4. x) Flexible resource limits with placeholders Better control over parallel loops Reliable SubDAG Output resolution How these updates help you in OpenShift AI An important heads-up: The data science pipelines 2.0 change Wrapping up Learn more Get started with AI Inference About the author Alex Handy More like this Blog post Blog post Blog post Keep exploring Browse by channel Automation Artificial intelligence Open hybrid cloud Security Edge computing Infrastructure Applications Virtualization Share If you’ve ever struggled with manual, inconsistent, or expensive machine learning (ML) workflows (or if you&amp;rsquo;d love to have a formalized workflow at all), you’re not alone! Many teams hit roadblocks when trying to automate, scale, or manage their ML pipelines—especially as projects grow, scope creeps, and requirements inevitably change. Red Hat OpenShift AI now brings a set of updates to data science pipelines, making it easier than ever to control and optimize your ML processes. These improvements aren’t just about new features, they’re also about helping you optimize resource consumption and minimize the 2am on-call page-outs by building workflows you can trust in production. Think of a data science pipeline in OpenShift AI as the navigation system for your entire ML workflow. You can visually build this pipeline, which is powered by a structure called a directed acyclic graph (DAG). A DAG acts as the blueprint for your process, from data prep to deployment, by mapping out each task in a clear, one-way workflow. This structure is what makes sure that every step runs in the correct order and your pipeline doesn&amp;rsquo;t get stuck in an infinite loop. This blueprint or map is technically a graph where each component (a node) runs inside of a container on Red Hat OpenShift. These nodes are connected by edges (think of this as the arrows on a flow chart), which define their dependencies, so a task only runs after its prerequisites are met and the appropriate outputs go to the right places (the inputs of the next steps). The graph is &amp;ldquo;directed&amp;rdquo; because the workflow only moves forward and &amp;ldquo;acyclic&amp;rdquo; because it can&amp;rsquo;t circle back on itself. This workflow gives you precise control over your ML operations, making more efficient use of cluster resources.</description></item><item><title>Why defence organisations need resilience beyond sovereignty</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-09-02-why-defence-organisations-need-resilience-beyond-sovereignty/</link><pubDate>Tue, 02 Sep 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-09-02-why-defence-organisations-need-resilience-beyond-sovereignty/</guid><description>Why defence organisations need resilience beyond sovereignty Why autonomy matters The three pillars of autonomy Open source is the foundation of autonomy Beyond sovereignty to resilience Learn more Red Hat Learning Subscription | Product Trial About the author Giuseppe Magnotta More like this Blog post Blog post Blog post Keep exploring Browse by channel Automation Artificial intelligence Open hybrid cloud Security Edge computing Infrastructure Applications Virtualization Share Amid rising geopolitical tensions, digital sovereignty has become a focal point for governments and enterprises alike. However, for defence organisations, sovereignty alone is not enough. The ability to maintain operational resilience in the face of conflict or severe geopolitical disruption requires the capacity to act independently when cooperation is impossible. Only true autonomy can provide that ability. Digital sovereignty , whether cloud, data, or total sovereignty, refers to control over digital assets, so data, hardware, people, and software remain within a specific jurisdiction. While sovereignty addresses regulatory and jurisdictional concerns, it does not guarantee operational continuity in crisis scenarios. Strategic autonomy, however, goes further. It means maintaining the ability to collaborate with international partners when possible, while retaining the independence to operate alone when necessary. For defence organisations, this is a matter of mission survival. In peacetime, reliance on hyperscale cloud providers and distributed IT infrastructure is manageable. But in conflict, the landscape shifts dramatically. Physical destruction can render data centres inoperable, while internet outages cripple cloud-dependent operations.</description></item><item><title>Kubernetes v1.34: DRA has graduated to GA</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-09-01-kubernetes-v1-34-dra-has-graduated-to-ga/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Sep 2025 10:30:00 -0800</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-09-01-kubernetes-v1-34-dra-has-graduated-to-ga/</guid><description>Kubernetes v1.34: DRA has graduated to GA The core of DRA is now GA Features promoted to beta New alpha features What’s next? Getting involved Acknowledgments Kubernetes 1.34 is here, and it has brought a huge wave of enhancements for Dynamic Resource Allocation (DRA)! This release marks a major milestone with many APIs in the resource. k8s. io group graduating to General Availability (GA), unlocking the full potential of how you manage devices on Kubernetes. On top of that, several key features have moved to beta, and a fresh batch of new alpha features promise even more expressiveness and flexibility. resource. k8s. io Let&amp;rsquo;s dive into what&amp;rsquo;s new for DRA in Kubernetes 1.34! The headline feature of the v1.34 release is that the core of DRA has graduated to General Availability. Kubernetes Dynamic Resource Allocation (DRA) provides a flexible framework for managing specialized hardware and infrastructure resources, such as GPUs or FPGAs. DRA provides APIs that enable each workload to specify the properties of the devices it needs, but leaving it to the scheduler to allocate actual devices, allowing increased reliability and improved utilization of expensive hardware. With the graduation to GA, DRA is stable and will be part of Kubernetes for the long run. The community can still expect a steady stream of new features being added to DRA over the next several Kubernetes releases, but they will not make any breaking changes to DRA. So users and developers of DRA drivers can start adopting DRA with confidence.</description></item><item><title>Kubernetes v1.34: Finer-Grained Control Over Container Restarts</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-08-29-kubernetes-v1-34-finer-grained-control-over-container-restarts/</link><pubDate>Fri, 29 Aug 2025 10:30:00 -0800</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-08-29-kubernetes-v1-34-finer-grained-control-over-container-restarts/</guid><description>Kubernetes v1.34: Finer-Grained Control Over Container Restarts The problem with a single restart policy Introducing per-container restart policies Use cases In-place restarts for training jobs Try-once init containers Pods with multiple containers How to use it Example 1: Restarting on specific exit codes Example 2: A try-once init container Example 3: Containers with different restart policies Learn more Roadmap Your feedback is welcome! With the release of Kubernetes 1.34, a new alpha feature is introduced that gives you more granular control over container restarts within a Pod. This feature, named Container Restart Policy and Rules , allows you to specify a restart policy for each container individually, overriding the Pod&amp;rsquo;s global restart policy. In addition, it also allows you to conditionally restart individual containers based on their exit codes. This feature is available behind the alpha feature gate ContainerRestartRules. ContainerRestartRules This has been a long-requested feature. Let&amp;rsquo;s dive into how it works and how you can use it. Before this feature, the restartPolicy was set at the Pod level. This meant that all containers in a Pod shared the same restart policy ( Always , OnFailure , or Never ). While this works for many use cases, it can be limiting in others. restartPolicy Always OnFailure Never For example, consider a Pod with a main application container and an init container that performs some initial setup. You might want the main container to always restart on failure, but the init container should only run once and never restart. With a single Pod-level restart policy, this wasn&amp;rsquo;t possible.</description></item><item><title>From VLAN Tag to Segment: Using Guest VLAN Tagging in NSX</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-08-29-from-vlan-tag-to-segment-using-guest-vlan-tagging-in-nsx/</link><pubDate>Fri, 29 Aug 2025 18:16:13 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-08-29-from-vlan-tag-to-segment-using-guest-vlan-tagging-in-nsx/</guid><description>Guest VLAN Tagging alone… not great with NSX Mapping VLAN Tags to NSX Segments Step 1 – Attach the VM to a segment Step 2 – Convert the VM’s port into a parent port Step 3 – Create child ports for each VLAN Notes Configuration steps VM Configuration Creation of a child port using API Step 1 – Retrieve the VM’s Port Step 2 – Convert the Port into a Parent Port Step 3 – Create a Child Port for VLAN 10 Creation of a Child Port for via UI Related Articles From VLAN Tag to Segment: Using Guest VLAN Tagging in NSX Save Costs and Scale Efficiently with vSAN Deduplication in VMware Cloud Foundation 9.0 How to Connect your VMware Private AI Services Agents to OpenWeb UI By default, a virtual machine sends traffic to its vNIC untagged. The virtual switch then receives that traffic into a single VLAN or NSX segment. This model limits a VM to connecting to at most 10 networks directly. But what if we need to connect the VM to more than 10 networks? With VLAN-backed networking, this is where Guest VLAN Tagging (GVT) comes in. When Guest VLAN Tagging is enabled on a port group, the VM itself is responsible for inserting VLAN tags (802. 1Q C-TAGs) into the frames it transmits. The virtual switch then uses the tag to direct the frame to the correct VLAN. With this approach, a single vNIC can access up to 4,094 VLAN-backed networks , dramatically increasing connectivity without adding more virtual NICs. Guest VLAN Tagging is enabled by specifying a VLAN ID range on the port group. For example, if you configure a range of 10–20, the vNIC will accept traffic tagged with VLAN IDs from 10 to 20, while dropping traffic tagged with IDs outside that range. The VM’s operating system must, of course, be configured to generate the appropriate VLAN-tagged subinterfaces. Guest VLAN Tagging can also be configured on NSX segments in a similar way, but there is an important difference: NSX segments are not identified by VLAN IDs.</description></item><item><title>VMware Cloud Foundation – Cloud on Your Terms</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-08-29-vmware-cloud-foundation-cloud-on-your-terms/</link><pubDate>Fri, 29 Aug 2025 16:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-08-29-vmware-cloud-foundation-cloud-on-your-terms/</guid><description>Related Articles VMware Cloud Foundation - Cloud on Your Terms VMware Cloud Services Portal migration to the Broadcom Cloud Console Broadcom and Canonical Partner to Fast-track and Secure Containerized Workload Deployments on VMware Cloud Foundation At Broadcom, we are committed to empowering our customers to build and manage modern private clouds on their own terms.

A very impressive goal, but this purist vision can alienate traditional developers and slow innovation. It’s time to expand the definition, and embrace a broader perspective: AI agents don’t always need to self-learn or chase lofty goals. Functional agents —a new term—that connect large language models (LLMs) to APIs, physical devices, or event-driven systems can be just as impactful. By prioritizing function over form, we enable a broader pool of developers to engage in building AI agents, empower both AI and traditional developers to collaborate, and build practical solutions that drive real-world value. Let’s make progress without always demanding perfection. The traditional definition of an AI agent—rooted in significant AI research—demands autonomy, reasoning, learning, and goal-oriented behavior. These agents, like those powering autonomous vehicles or reinforcement learning models, are impressive but complex. They require deep expertise in machine learning (ML), which can feel like a barrier to traditional developers skilled in APIs, databases, or event-driven architectures. This purist stance risks gatekeeping, sidelining practical agents that don’t learn, but still solve critical problems. Why should an agent that wraps an API call or responds to a sensor be considered inferior? Not every challenge needs a self-evolving neural network—sometimes, a reliable, lightweight solution is enough.</description></item><item><title>Friday Five — August 29, 2025</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-08-29-friday-five-august-29-2025/</link><pubDate>Fri, 29 Aug 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-08-29-friday-five-august-29-2025/</guid><description>Friday Five — August 29, 2025 Edge Industry Review : Orbital data center heads to ISS to test real-time edge computing in space Financial services giant strengthens DR through automation What is AI security?

By applying digital signatures to software artifacts, trust can be established to verify that assets have not been substituted or tampered with through the software development and delivery process. Red Hat Trusted Artifact Signer , a key component of Red Hat’s Trusted Software Supply Chain portfolio , provides a suite of tools that supports signing and verifying assets from first commit to deployment. Since Trusted Artifact Signer was first released, it has been available as a Day-2 operator on Red Hat OpenShift. With the release of version 1.2, you can now also deploy the entire Trusted Artifact Signer suite onto a Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) machine, providing another option for where to run the service. An installation of Trusted Artifact Signer within an RHEL environment will feel familiar to those who have previously deployed the service on OpenShift. Linux containers continue to be the primary delivery vehicle and it relies on the same content source, enabling a consistent experience wherever the service is deployed. One of the goals associated with the design and implementation of Trusted Artifact Signer on RHEL was to include the same core components and to remain as feature-compatible as possible with the existing OpenShift-based deployment. This includes: The entire suite of Trusted Artifact Signer based services, including Fulcio, Rekor, TUF, and a Timestamp Authority The ability to expose each of the services using a set of provided TLS certificates The ability to utilize external instances of MySQL and/or Redis You can also now use Cockpit to monitor the deployment of Trusted Artifact Signer on RHEL. Once enabled, the management of container instances can all be governed within a single console using tooling that is familiar with most RHEL administrators.

This type of deployment is often referred to as air-gapped. Common air-gapped environments include ships, vehicles, aircraft, remote industrial sites, nuclear facilities, and emergency field operations. These are locations where traditional network connectivity is unavailable or undesired, but where critical decision-making, predictive maintenance, resource estimation, safety monitoring, intrusion detection, and anomaly detection are essential. To address the challenges of operating in air-gapped environments (including lack of connectivity, limited hardware resources, manual update procedures, and the need for secure, autonomous systems) where agility in deployment and redeployment is critical, a portable edge zero touch provisioning (ZTP) solution can be adopted. Across various industry use cases, several essential requirements consistently emerge, which can be integrated into the ZTP solution: Self-contained: No dependency on cloud API or external data sources Long-lived: Must run for weeks or months without updates Secure by default: Threat models assume local tampering or sabotage Hardware-aware: Limited compute, storage, power, and rugged devices Manually updatable: Updates over USB, SD cards, or other physical media Network-constrained: Low, intermittent, or no connectivity (GSM, satellite, or fully offline) With common characteristics of air-gapped and resource-constrained environments identified, a portable edge ZTP architecture pattern can now be defined: Immutable infrastructure Description: The system, including operating system and services, is deployed as read-only, signed images. Benefits: Helps prevent drift and unauthorized changes, ensuring system integrity and security, which is crucial in an isolated environment.

However, handling diverse security data sources such as software bill of materials (SBOMs), critical vulnerabilities and exploits (CVEs), and vendor advisories remains a major challenge due to inconsistent formats, varying levels of detail, and the lack of standardized integration points. Addressing this challenge requires not only better tools, but also open collaboration across the entire ecosystem, demanding transparency and trust. In an effort to create a more unified and scalable solution for managing security metadata, Red Hat is proud to contribute Trustify to the Graph for Understanding Artifact Composition (GUAC), an Open Source Security Foundation (OpenSSF) incubating project. This contribution reflects Red Hat’s belief that transparent, upstream-first innovation is essential to building security solutions that are more scalable, interoperable, and community-driven. Under the OpenSSF umbrella, end-users will be able to contribute and collaborate to Trustify, helping to grow the project adoption and mature the technology. Trustify is an open source project, developed by Red Hat, that provides a high-performance, searchable backend for software supply chain metadata. It supports SBOM and advisory formats such as SPDX, CycloneDX, and OSV, and is designed for integration into modern continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) workflows. The GUAC open source project aggregates and connects software security metadata into a unified graph. It enables developers and security teams to answer complex questions about software provenance, vulnerability impact, and supply chain integrity at scale. Both Trustify and GUAC are designed to tackle the overwhelming challenge of managing vast amounts of software security data that can lead to unmanageable vulnerability handling for security engineers (also known as “alert fatigue”). While Trustify focuses on providing a single, searchable database for SBOMs, CVEs and advisories, GUAC&amp;rsquo;s strength lies in its ability to normalize data from multiple sources into a rich graph database, providing deeper insights and actionable intelligence.</description></item><item><title>Extreme Performance Series 2025: VMware Cloud Foundation 9.0 in the Hands-On Labs</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-08-27-extreme-performance-series-2025-vmware-cloud-foundation-9-0-in-the-hands-on-labs/</link><pubDate>Wed, 27 Aug 2025 21:29:32 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-08-27-extreme-performance-series-2025-vmware-cloud-foundation-9-0-in-the-hands-on-labs/</guid><description>Related Articles Extreme Performance Series 2025: VMware Cloud Foundation 9.0 in the Hands-On Labs Extreme Performance Series 2025: vSAN ESA vs Traditional Storage Array Extreme Performance Video Blog Series 2025 The Extreme Performance Series is back for 2025!

Related Articles Broadcom and Canonical Partner to Fast-track and Secure Containerized Workload Deployments on VMware Cloud Foundation Strengthened Cyber-Risk Management and Compliance for Large-Scale VMware Cloud Foundation Environments Building your GenAI Agents on VCF with Private AI Services Today at VMware Explore’s general session you saw Chris Wolf demonstrate Intelligent Assist for VMware Cloud Foundation, providing AI-powered assistance for our users. In this blog, we’ll take a step behind the curtain to see how these capabilities are running in VCF, using AI features that our customers can also use to build their own AI experiences with their own private data. VMware Private AI services enable administrators to safely and securely import and share approved AI models (Model Gallery and Model Governance); scale and run Models as a Service for their organization (Model Runtime and ML API gateway); create Knowledge bases and regularly refresh data in a fully supported vector database for creating RAG applications (Data Indexing and Retrieval Service in partnership with Data Services Manager); and provide developers a UI where they can compose models, knowledge bases, and tools together to create Agents (Agent Builder). The Intelligent Assist service is using these capabilities to run the Intelligent Assist agent, and VCF engineering teams are using these services as a common AI platform to deliver joint services and AI workflows. Customers can also use these same capabilities for their own teams. These features give private cloud administrators what they need to safely download, validate, and share models with teams across their cloud. Learn about how to safely onboard popular models from upstream and ensure the model’s behavior meets your enterprises’ expectations and requirements – and behavior doesn’t drift over time in this blog post. Now that you have models securely imported and shared with the right folks in your organization, you will want to run them in an efficient and scalable way. Gone are the days of every division running their own separate copies of the same popular models – instead your team can provide Models as a Service using the Model Runtime. Deploy models on a fully maintained runtime stack from directly within VCF, and then horizontally scale them as they come under load with no end user impact, as users broker their requests via the ML API gateway. This also gives you flexibility to do rolling upgrades of models with zero end user impact. This method of deploying models allows separate lines of business or tenants within a Cloud Service Provider to keep their data separate from each other while ensuring high GPU utilization.</description></item><item><title>Engineering the Next Generation of VMware Cloud Foundation</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-08-26-engineering-the-next-generation-of-vmware-cloud-foundation/</link><pubDate>Tue, 26 Aug 2025 12:30:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-08-26-engineering-the-next-generation-of-vmware-cloud-foundation/</guid><description>VMware Cloud Foundation – The Platform For What’s Next Infrastructure at the Speed of the Developer Private AI as a Service Taking It Further with VCF Advanced Cyber Compliance The Path Forward Related Articles Broadcom and Canonical Partner to Fast-track and Secure Containerized Workload Deployments on VMware Cloud Foundation Strengthened Cyber-Risk Management and Compliance for Large-Scale VMware Cloud Foundation Environments Building your GenAI Agents on VCF with Private AI Services The private cloud is entering a new era. The workloads our infrastructure must serve have shifted from traditional applications only to also include distributed systems, data-intensive analytics, and AI-driven models that demand unprecedented agility and scale. VMware Cloud Foundation (VCF) has always been about giving customers a single, integrated platform to build and operate their private cloud with consistency. But the requirements are evolving—and so must the platform. And VMware Cloud Foundation isn’t just adapting to enterprise transformation – it’s leading it. VCFis the engine driving how modern businesses reimagine their infrastructure, applications, and data strategies. Each new innovation isn’t a reaction to where the industry is going—it sets the pace for what’s possible in the private cloud – whether it’s in a central datacenter, edge or in the hyperscaler environment. VCF 9.0 set the benchmark for the modern private cloud: Sovereign by Design – Data residency tags, geo-fencing, and automated certificate rotation to embed compliance into the platform. Operational Simplicity – New installer, unified fleet management, and streamlined lifecycle operations reduce deployment and maintenance overhead. Modern App Platform – vSphere Kubernetes Service and VM Service deliver VMs and containers side by side with GitOps-driven automation. Performance &amp;amp; Efficiency – NVMe memory tiering and global vSAN deduplication boost scale and flash efficiency at lower cost.

The ever-evolving risks presented by today’s modern threat landscape pose unprecedented challenges that most today are ill-equipped to address. With ransomware attacks becoming increasingly sophisticated and regulatory guidelines more stringent, cyber-risk management and compliance lie at the core of every strategic IT decision made by C-Suite executives and board members. 51% of leaders reported security, data protection and privacy as key priorities to enable compliant operations 1. However, the path to achieve successful outcomes is beset with obstacles. Why Organizations Struggle to Manage Cyber-Risk and Maintain Compliance Reactive vs. Proactive Response: data is scattered across different applications in multiple geographic locations, each with its own rules and regulations. 63% of organizations report that complexity from the disaggregated nature of data as the main challenge to maintain compliance 2. Policy monitoring for virtual machines (VMs), containers, databases, infrastructure and technology stack components is siloed, which hinders early detection of drifts and leads to a reactive versus proactive response. Manual Remediation and Recovery: policy management and recovery lack automation, which directly impacts an organization’s ability to scale operations and preserve compliance as applications are changed, moved or deleted. Intense manual intervention inevitably delays time to audit-readiness and leaves unaddressed gaps that could expose critical workloads to increased damage. Stitching of Multiple Tools: consolidation of cyber-risk management, resilience and recovery is easier said than done. Most organizations rely on a piecemeal approach, plagued with operational complexity and inefficiencies that increase chances of human error.</description></item><item><title>Unleashing the Power of Private AI: New Innovations from Broadcom with NVIDIA</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-08-26-unleashing-the-power-of-private-ai-new-innovations-from-broadcom-with-nvidia/</link><pubDate>Tue, 26 Aug 2025 12:30:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-08-26-unleashing-the-power-of-private-ai-new-innovations-from-broadcom-with-nvidia/</guid><description>VMware Private AI Services Now Included in VCF Subscription New Capabilities Supported now NVIDIA Blackwell Architecture Support Future Releases Enable Privacy and Security Multi-tenant models as a service Simplify Infrastructure Management DirectPath enablement for GPUs with VMware Private AI Foundation with NVIDIA Intelligent Assist with VCF Streamline Model Deployment Model Context Protocol (MCP) High-Speed Networking with Enhanced DirectPath I/O VCF Support for NVIDIA HGX Platform with Blackwell GPUs and NVSwitch VCF Support for NVIDIA HGX B200 New Partners in the VMware Private AI Ecosystem Related Articles Broadcom and Canonical Partner to Fast-track and Secure Containerized Workload Deployments on VMware Cloud Foundation Strengthened Cyber-Risk Management and Compliance for Large-Scale VMware Cloud Foundation Environments Building your GenAI Agents on VCF with Private AI Services Enterprises can get tremendous productivity and business transformation from AI.

Read about the challenges associated with 5G core lifecycle management, software versioning, and its impact on testing and verification. Find out how Red Hat and Rebaca’s autonomous continuous testing framework helps service providers with the consistent delivery of compliant and interoperable 5G core cloud-native network functions (CNFs). Deploying a 5G core network involves several key components, including the Access and Mobility Management Function (AMF) for connection and mobility management, the Session Management Function (SMF) for managing user data sessions, the User Plane Function (UPF) for service delivery, the Network Repository Function (NRF) for service discovery, and the Policy Control Function (PCF) for policy enforcement among others. A significant challenge for telecommunication (telco) service providers is the management of different software versions of these network functions, especially in a multivendor environment. A particular version may include new features, bug fixes, or require specific configurations. Consequently, testing of the network functions is complex, going beyond the verification of each component&amp;rsquo;s functionality to ensure that various versions of these network functions can interoperate. Dealing with this complexity necessitates extensive testing automation to guarantee streamlined operations across the service provider’s network. Adopting a cloud-native design for the 5G core gives service providers a competitive edge in building networks that easily scale and adapt. A distributed and disaggregated 5G core network introduces additional challenges, particularly around ensuring that all the different components can work together. As 5G core cloud-native network functions (CNFs) are made up of microservices that are constantly being updated and deployed in a dynamic environment, keeping tabs on security and adherence to standards becomes an overwhelming task. To ensure that all independently developed components of the 5G core operate effectively, the various network functions within the 5G core must interoperate efficiently, adhering to 3GPP standards.</description></item><item><title>Extreme Performance Series 2025: vSAN ESA vs Traditional Storage Array</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-08-25-extreme-performance-series-2025-vsan-esa-vs-traditional-storage-array/</link><pubDate>Mon, 25 Aug 2025 20:34:53 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-08-25-extreme-performance-series-2025-vsan-esa-vs-traditional-storage-array/</guid><description>Related Articles Extreme Performance Series 2025: VMware Cloud Foundation 9.0 in the Hands-On Labs Extreme Performance Series 2025: vSAN ESA vs Traditional Storage Array Extreme Performance Video Blog Series 2025 The Extreme Performance Series is back for 2025!

Military organizations are increasingly operating across a hybrid infrastructure, spanning the strategic core, deployed edge, and tactical edge, while maintaining absolute control over their systems. However, this evolution presents significant challenges, from siloed technologies to cybersecurity threats. Defence organizations must navigate these obstacles by adopting a unified platform approach, leveraging an open framework based on open standards to strengthen autonomy, security, and seamless operations across all environments. Traditionally, defence operations began in the strategic core, which were large, on-premise data centers disconnected from the internet. These handled everything from mission planning to logistics. The first wave of transformation introduced private cloud solutions, allowing military organizations to scale infrastructure dynamically while maintaining digital sovereignty. Many defence entities remain cautious about using the public cloud due to security concerns, opting instead for air-gapped private clouds—physically isolated environments within their facilities—so only screened personnel and verified secure networks have access. Today, the focus has shifted to edge computing, highlighting the need for smarter, real-time, and autonomous decision-making in the field. Defence organizations now operate across two key edge environments, the deployed edge and the tactical edge. The deployed edge consists of mini data centres, capable of running mission-critical applications, processing intelligence and supporting AI workloads. Meanwhile, the tactical edge encompasses lightweight, ruggedized devices such as drones, autonomous vehicles, and soldier-worn systems that can collect, analyse, and act on data in real time, often completely disconnected from central networks.</description></item><item><title>KubeCon India 2025 with Kubeflow: Our Community Experience</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-08-23-kubecon-india-2025-with-kubeflow-our-community-experience/</link><pubDate>Sat, 23 Aug 2025 00:00:00 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-08-23-kubecon-india-2025-with-kubeflow-our-community-experience/</guid><description>Introduction Featured Talks Kubeflow Booth Highlights Our experience Want to help?

For DenizBank, one of Türkiye&amp;rsquo;s leading private banks, this means a strong commitment to integrating artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) into the core of its operations. Driving this technological evolution within DenizBank is Intertech, DenizBank&amp;rsquo;s IT subsidiary, which has played a key role in redefining what&amp;rsquo;s possible in banking. Before this modernization, DenizBank&amp;rsquo;s data science teams faced significant hurdles that hindered their ability to innovate quickly. Their workflows were characterized by: Manual and inflexible environments : Over 120 data scientists were using a Virtual Desktop Infrastructure (VDI) for model development. This VDI-based environment was not only slow and resource-intensive, but it also made lifecycle management of continuously changing Python libraries incredibly difficult. It forced them to rely on cumbersome digital workstations where each new model required a complex, manual setup. A lack of standardization : Without a unified platform, consistency was a major issue. Data access methods, model environments, database integrations, and code repositories varied from one data scientist to another, making collaboration and management difficult. Slow time-to-market and deployment : The manual processes created a development bottleneck. It was also taking a significant amount of time to decide which model to deploy, as business teams struggled to understand and compare which models performed better. This indecision meant that critical business opportunities were being missed.</description></item><item><title>Friday Five — August 22, 2025</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-08-22-friday-five-august-22-2025/</link><pubDate>Fri, 22 Aug 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-08-22-friday-five-august-22-2025/</guid><description>Friday Five — August 22, 2025 An open world: Why Red Hat supports the United Nations Open Source Principles Production AI success: From gen AI promise to business impact More than meets the eye: Behind the scenes of Red Hat Enterprise Linux 10 Evolve your Citrix Infrastructure: Unlocking agility and efficiency with Red Hat OpenShift Virtualization Agentic AI vs. generative AI About the author Red Hat Corporate Communications More like this Blog post Blog post Blog post Keep exploring Browse by channel Automation Artificial intelligence Open hybrid cloud Security Edge computing Infrastructure Applications Virtualization Share Red Hat is formally endorsing the United Nations (UN) Open Source Principles, which align closely with their own long-standing practices of open collaboration and community building.

This week, the founders and core team behind Styra announced that they are joining Apple. I first met the Styra team at KubeCon 2017 in Austin, when Brian Grant saw an early demo of what we were building, and suggested that I talk to them. Although we have significantly different approaches to PaC, one of my favorite moments at each KubeCon since has been catching up with folks from Styra and exchanging notes on the space. We here at Nirmata, want to take a moment to recognize and thank the entire Styra team – their founders Teemu, Tim, Torin, along with Anders, Charlie and many others – for their pioneering work. Without their vision and drive, there would be no PaC ecosystem as we know it today. At Nirmata, we know that Kyverno’s journey, and our own, would not have been possible without the foundation laid by the OPA community. The early adoption of OPA proved the need for declarative policies and automated governance. It set the standard for how organizations think about declarative policies across cloud and infrastructure environments and it will continue to play an important role in the CNCF landscape. We are also encouraged that the Styra team has found a great home at Apple. With such a strong technology leader supporting them, the OPA community can look forward to ongoing innovation, stability, and new opportunities for growth. We are excited to see what comes next in the OPA roadmap and how the project continues to evolve as a critical part of the cloud native landscape.</description></item><item><title>Kubernetes v1.34.0-rc.2</title><link>https://kubermates.org/releases/2025-08-20-kubernetes-v1-34-0-rc-2/</link><pubDate>Wed, 20 Aug 2025 21:15:15 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/releases/2025-08-20-kubernetes-v1-34-0-rc-2/</guid><description>See kubernetes-announce@.

This article focuses exclusively on tuning swap on Linux nodes, where this feature is available. By allowing Linux nodes to use secondary storage for additional virtual memory when physical RAM is exhausted, node swap support aims to improve resource utilization and reduce out-of-memory (OOM) kills. However, enabling swap is not a &amp;ldquo;turn-key&amp;rdquo; solution. The performance and stability of your nodes under memory pressure are critically dependent on a set of Linux kernel parameters. Misconfiguration can lead to performance degradation and interfere with Kubelet&amp;rsquo;s eviction logic. In this blogpost, I&amp;rsquo;ll dive into critical Linux kernel parameters that govern swap behavior. I will explore how these parameters influence Kubernetes workload performance, swap utilization, and crucial eviction mechanisms. I will present various test results showcasing the impact of different configurations, and share my findings on achieving optimal settings for stable and high-performing Kubernetes clusters. At a high level, the Linux kernel manages memory through pages, typically 4KiB in size. When physical memory becomes constrained, the kernel&amp;rsquo;s page replacement algorithm decides which pages to move to swap space. While the exact logic is a sophisticated optimization, this decision-making process is influenced by certain key factors: Page access patterns (how recently pages are accessed) Page dirtyness (whether pages have been modified) Memory pressure (how urgently the system needs free memory) It is important to understand that not all memory pages are the same.</description></item><item><title>Introducing langchain-gradient: Seamless LangChain Integration with DigitalOcean Gradient™ AI Platform</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-08-19-introducing-langchain-gradient-seamless-langchain-integration-with-digitalocean-/</link><pubDate>Tue, 19 Aug 2025 17:37:45 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-08-19-introducing-langchain-gradient-seamless-langchain-integration-with-digitalocean-/</guid><description>Introducing langchain-gradient: Seamless LangChain Integration with DigitalOcean Gradientâ¢ AI Platform Why langchain-gradient?

Deep insights: Start with high-level queries and dig deeper with prompts like &amp;ldquo;List all the problematic pods&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;How can I fix this pod?&amp;rdquo; Focused &amp;amp; relevant: Ask questions in the context of what you&amp;rsquo;re viewing in the UI, such as &amp;ldquo;What&amp;rsquo;s wrong here?&amp;rdquo; Action-oriented: Let the AI take action for you, like &amp;ldquo;Restart that deployment&amp;rdquo; , with your permission. Here is a demo of the AI Assistant in action as it helps troubleshoot an application running with issues in a Kubernetes cluster: Large Language Models (LLMs) have transformed not just how we access data but also how we interact with it. The rise of tools like ChatGPT opened a world of possibilities, inspiring a wave of new applications. Asking questions or giving commands in natural language is intuitive, especially for users who aren&amp;rsquo;t deeply technical. Now everyone can quickly ask how to do X or Y, without feeling awkward or having to traverse pages and pages of documentation like before. Therefore, Headlamp AI Assistant brings a conversational UI to Headlamp , powered by LLMs that Headlamp users can configure with their own API keys. It is available as a Headlamp plugin, making it easy to integrate into your existing setup. Users can enable it by installing the plugin and configuring it with their own LLM API keys, giving them control over which model powers the assistant. Once enabled, the assistant becomes part of the Headlamp UI, ready to respond to contextual queries and perform actions directly from the interface.</description></item><item><title>Kubernetes v1.34.0-rc.0</title><link>https://kubermates.org/releases/2025-08-06-kubernetes-v1-34-0-rc-0/</link><pubDate>Wed, 06 Aug 2025 20:20:08 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/releases/2025-08-06-kubernetes-v1-34-0-rc-0/</guid><description>See kubernetes-announce@.

Get involved Kubernetes v1.34 is coming at the end of August 2025. This release will not include any removal or deprecation, but it is packed with an impressive number of enhancements. Here are some of the features we are most excited about in this cycle! Please note that this information reflects the current state of v1.34 development and may change before release. The following list highlights some of the notable enhancements likely to be included in the v1.34 release, but is not an exhaustive list of all planned changes. This is not a commitment and the release content is subject to change. Dynamic Resource Allocation (DRA) provides a flexible way to categorize, request, and use devices like GPUs or custom hardware in your Kubernetes cluster. Since the v1.30 release, DRA has been based around claiming devices using structured parameters that are opaque to the core of Kubernetes. The relevant enhancement proposal, KEP-4381 , took inspiration from dynamic provisioning for storage volumes. DRA with structured parameters relies on a set of supporting API kinds: ResourceClaim, DeviceClass, ResourceClaimTemplate, and ResourceSlice API types under resource. k8s. io , while extending the. spec for Pods with a new resourceClaims field.</description></item><item><title>Four Powerful, New Features to Help You Build and Deploy More Efficient Apps On DigitalOcean Kubernetes</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-07-22-four-powerful-new-features-to-help-you-build-and-deploy-more-efficient-apps-on-d/</link><pubDate>Tue, 22 Jul 2025 16:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-07-22-four-powerful-new-features-to-help-you-build-and-deploy-more-efficient-apps-on-d/</guid><description>Four Powerful, New Features to Help You Build and Deploy More Efficient Apps On DigitalOcean Kubernetes DigitalOcean Managed Kubernetes support for new GPU Droplets types Nodepool Scale-to-zero DigitalOcean Kubernetes now available in our new, AI-optimized Atlanta data center (ATL1) DigitalOcean Kubernetes Routing Agent now generally available (GA) Get started About the author Try DigitalOcean for free Related Articles Announcing OpenAI gpt-oss Models on the DigitalOcean Gradientâ¢ AI Platform Build smarter AI agents: new tools now available for the DigitalOcean Gradientâ¢ AI Platform Introducing GPU Droplets accelerated by NVIDIA HGX H200 By Nicole Ghalwash Published: July 22, 2025 4 min read Weâre adding to Marchâs updates with even more Managed Kubernetes features that will help you get even more utility out of the productâincluding newly supported Droplet types, the ability to automatically scale nodes to zero when youâre not using them, and more.

You hit &amp;ldquo;submit. &amp;quot; And then you wait… That rejection email always stings. We’ve all been there. But what if you could change the odds? What if you could move from hoping your talk gets chosen to expecting it? After speaking at numerous global conferences and analyzing hundreds of accepted and rejected talks, I’ve found that a winning proposal isn’t about luck. It’s about strategy. This guide will break down that strategy, making it applicable for any tech event, from a local Google Community Day to the global stages of KubeCon or a Linux Foundation Summit. Before you write a single word of your abstract, you need to pick the right topic. The best topics sit at the intersection of three things: It Solves a Painful, Urgent Problem: Reviewers are looking for talks that solve a real-world problem their audience is facing right now. A talk on “migrating to Kubernetes” was a guaranteed hit in 2019, but in 2025, the problem is no longer urgent. Conversely, a talk on “ securing a Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) system” is incredibly urgent today because it’s a new, complex technology with high stakes and few established best practices. Ask yourself: What are people complaining about on social media or in community Slacks? What new technology is causing both excitement and anxiety? That’s where you’ll find winning topics.</description></item><item><title>Democratizing AI Model Training on Kubernetes: Introducing Kubeflow Trainer V2</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-07-21-democratizing-ai-model-training-on-kubernetes-introducing-kubeflow-trainer-v2/</link><pubDate>Mon, 21 Jul 2025 00:00:00 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-07-21-democratizing-ai-model-training-on-kubernetes-introducing-kubeflow-trainer-v2/</guid><description>Background and Evolution User Personas Python SDK Simplified API Extensibility and Pipeline Framework LLMs Fine-Tuning Support Dataset and Model Initializers Use of JobSet API Kueue Integration MPI Support Gang-Scheduling Fault Tolerance Improvements What’s Next?

Migration from Training Operator v1 Resources and Community Running machine learning workloads on Kubernetes can be challenging. Distributed training and LLMs fine-tuning, in particular, involves managing multiple nodes, GPUs, large datasets, and fault tolerance, which often requires deep Kubernetes knowledge. The Kubeflow Trainer v2 (KF Trainer) was created to hide this complexity, by abstracting Kubernetes from AI Practitioners and providing the easiest, most scalable way to run distributed PyTorch jobs. The main goals of Kubeflow Trainer v2 include: Make AI/ML workloads easier to manage at scale Provide a Pythonic interface to train models Deliver the easiest and most scalable PyTorch distributed training on Kubernetes Add built-in support for fine-tuning large language models Abstract Kubernetes complexity from AI Practitioners Consolidate efforts between Kubernetes Batch WG and Kubeflow community We’re deeply grateful to all contributors and community members who made the Trainer v2 possible with their hard work and valuable feedback. We’d like to give special recognition to andreyvelich , tenzen-y , electronic-waste , astefanutti , ironicbo , mahdikhashan , kramaranya , harshal292004 , akshaychitneni , chenyi015 and the rest of the contributors. We would also like to highlight ahg-g , kannon92 , and vsoch whose feedback was essential while we designed the Kubeflow Trainer architecture together with the Batch WG. See the full contributor list for everyone who helped make this release possible. Kubeflow Trainer v2 represents the next evolution of the Kubeflow Training Operator , building on over seven years of experience running ML workloads on Kubernetes. The journey began in 2017 when the Kubeflow project introduced TFJob to orchestrate TensorFlow training on Kubernetes. At that time, Kubernetes lacked many of the advanced batch processing features needed for distributed ML training, so the community had to implement these capabilities from scratch. Over the years, the project expanded to support multiple ML frameworks including PyTorch , MXNet , MPI , and XGBoost through various specialized operators. In 2021, these were consolidated into the unified Training Operator v1.</description></item><item><title>Blog: Post-Quantum Cryptography in Kubernetes</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-07-18-blog-post-quantum-cryptography-in-kubernetes/</link><pubDate>Fri, 18 Jul 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-07-18-blog-post-quantum-cryptography-in-kubernetes/</guid><description>Post-Quantum Cryptography in Kubernetes What is Post-Quantum Cryptography Key exchange vs. digital signatures: different needs, different timelines State of PQC key exchange mechanisms (KEMs) today Post-quantum KEMs in Kubernetes: an unexpected arrival The Go version mismatch pitfall Limitations: packet size State of Post-Quantum Signatures Conclusion The world of cryptography is on the cusp of a major shift with the advent of quantum computing.

Redesigned Team Cards Better Visibility Into Policy Assignments Pagination for Better Performance Redesigned Team Details Page Major UI Cleanup New Tabbed Layout Smarter Member Management Why It Matters We’re excited to announce a refreshed Teams Dashboard in Nirmata Control Hub. This redesign delivers a cleaner, more intuitive interface that not only looks better, it works better too. Whether you’re managing a few teams or dozens, the new dashboard streamlines how you view and interact with team-related data across your Kubernetes and cloud environments. To improve visibility and team-level accountability, the dashboard now shows how infrastructure resources are allocated across teams. You can easily see which Kubernetes clusters, namespaces, and repositories belong to each team – such as Security, Platform, or Development – and who the team members are. This makes it simpler to understand team footprints, manage access, and align infrastructure usage with organizational structure. Team cards have been completely redesigned with a cleaner layout that makes key information immediately visible. Each card now includes: Total Members in the team Total Clusters assigned Total Namespaces assigned Total Repositories assigned This update gives you a high-level snapshot of your teams’ footprint across your infrastructure , helping you stay informed at a glance. We’ve improved how policy report assignments are surfaced on each team card, offering better visibility and preparing the groundwork for even more powerful insights and statistics in future releases. Instead of listing all teams on one long scroll, we now paginate the dashboard. You’ll see 12 teams at a time, making navigation faster and more manageable, especially for larger organizations. We’ve also made significant improvements to the Team Details page, focusing on clarity and ease of use.</description></item><item><title>What Is Kubernetes?

By keeping infrastructure and cost management simple, the Hatch program enables startups to build tech solutions that make an impact. For Georgi Petrov and Mihail Stoychev, the co-founders and serial entrepreneurs behind Uxify , choosing DigitalOcean to host their startupâs infrastructure was a no-brainer. They built their previous ventures NitroPack, SMSBump, and iSenseLabs on DigitalOcean and could trust the platformâs simplicity, reliability, and user experience. When it came time to power Uxifyâs AI-enabled website performance solution and AI agent Uxi, they opted for DigitalOcean again With Hatch program benefits like cloud credits and GPU Droplet discounts, Uxify could focus on building and scaling their underlying AI infrastructure. Uxifyâs story begins over a decade ago with iSenseLabs, an agency that provided services but also built and sold its own products. One of those products was NitroPack, a performance optimization tool designed to help websites load faster. As NitroPack gained traction, the team began seeing possibilities beyond their current solution. Fast forward to 2024, the team behind NitroPack reached a pivotal moment. They began rethinking web performance and userâs perception of site responsivenessâ¦ This new philosophy led them to develop Navigation AI, a performance solution focused on user experience rather than purely technical metrics. Around the same time, NitroPack was acquired by WP Engine. As part of that acquisition, the emerging Navigation AI project was spun out into a new company: Uxify.</description></item><item><title>Sharks of DigitalOcean: Laura Schaffer, VP, Growth</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-07-10-sharks-of-digitalocean-laura-schaffer-vp-growth/</link><pubDate>Thu, 10 Jul 2025 15:25:33 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-07-10-sharks-of-digitalocean-laura-schaffer-vp-growth/</guid><description>Sharks of DigitalOcean: Laura Schaffer, VP, Growth What makes DigitalOcean a unique place to work?

This blog post dives into the challenges of managing failure modes when operating pods with devices in Kubernetes, based on insights from Sergey Kanzhelev and Mrunal Patel&amp;rsquo;s talk at KubeCon NA 2024. You can follow the links to slides and recording. The rise of AI/ML workloads has brought new challenges to Kubernetes. These workloads often rely heavily on specialized hardware, and any device failure can significantly impact performance and lead to frustrating interruptions. As highlighted in the 2024 Llama paper , hardware issues, particularly GPU failures, are a major cause of disruption in AI/ML training. You can also learn how much effort NVIDIA spends on handling devices failures and maintenance in the KubeCon talk by Ryan Hallisey and Piotr Prokop All-Your-GPUs-Are-Belong-to-Us: An Inside Look at NVIDIA&amp;rsquo;s Self-Healing GeForce NOW Infrastructure ( recording ) as they see 19 remediation requests per 1000 nodes a day! We also see data centers offering spot consumption models and overcommit on power, making device failures commonplace and a part of the business model. However, Kubernetes’s view on resources is still very static. The resource is either there or not. And if it is there, the assumption is that it will stay there fully functional - Kubernetes lacks good support for handling full or partial hardware failures. These long-existing assumptions combined with the overall complexity of a setup lead to a variety of failure modes, which we discuss here. Generally, all AI/ML workloads require specialized hardware, have challenging scheduling requirements, and are expensive when idle.</description></item><item><title>Expanding DigitalOcean’s Role-Based Access Controls with custom roles</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-06-30-expanding-digitalocean-s-role-based-access-controls-with-custom-roles/</link><pubDate>Mon, 30 Jun 2025 17:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-06-30-expanding-digitalocean-s-role-based-access-controls-with-custom-roles/</guid><description>Expanding DigitalOceanâs Role-Based Access Controls with custom roles What are custom roles?

With custom roles, teams can now assign permissions to individuals that are precisely aligned with their operational and security requirements, reinforcing the principle of least privilege. This allows for more precise permission management, which helps to enhance overall infrastructure security by reducing the risk of over-privileged accounts. Custom roles give you full control over who can do what on your projects, improving the overall security of your cloud resources. In this blog post, we will walk through what custom roles are, how they work, key features, when to use them, and how they can help your team. Custom roles are user-defined sets of permissions that allow organizations to tailor access control to their specific needs, beyond whatâs available in predefined roles. In other words, custom roles let you create your own set of permissions instead of relying only on default, predefined roles (like Viewer, Billing Viewer, etc. ) that may not work for you. Now, users can define more detailed custom permissions that target specific resources and needs. For example, a user may only need read access to Droplets, but write access to Kubernetes. Hear what a DigitalOcean customer had to say about using custom roles.</description></item><item><title>Is Your Kyverno Healthy?

Why Kyverno Health Matters What’s New: Kyverno Health Check Real Example: NetworkPolicy for Kyverno Getting Started Why Kyverno Health Check Matters Running Kyverno is essential for enforcing Kubernetes governance and security policies. But is your Kyverno setup secure, scalable, and resilient? With the latest enhancement in Nirmata Control Hub , you no longer have to guess. We’re excited to introduce the Kyverno Health Check – a new capability that provides a clear, actionable view of Kyverno’s configuration in your clusters. Whether you’re a platform engineer managing dozens of clusters or a security lead enforcing policy compliance, this feature helps to ensure that Kyverno is running optimally at all times. Kyverno by Nirmata enforces critical security, compliance, and operational policies in Kubernetes. But like any controller, its effectiveness depends on its own configuration and health. A misconfigured or unhealthy Kyverno deployment can : Allow lateral network traffic to Kyverno pods. Fail under load due to insufficient resource settings Go unnoticed during outages due to missing observability. Or worse, be vulnerable to privilege escalation or unauthorized cluster-admin bindings Kyverno Health Check ensures none of this happens by continuously and vigilantly evaluating your deployments for best practices and known risks. The new Kyverno Health Check feature in Nirmata Control Hub evaluates Kyverno deployments based on four critical categories: Security Detects wildcard permissions, cluster-admin bindings, and missing NetworkPolicies Detects wildcard permissions, cluster-admin bindings, and missing NetworkPolicies Availability Checks for resource configurations, pod disruption budgets, and runtime stability of Kyverno.

As a platform engineer or administrator, you might look at your cluster or namespace and find hundreds or even thousands of violations. But not all violations are created equal. Some are critical security risks that demand immediate attention, while others are best practices that can be addressed later. The problem? Without clear guidance, most teams end up doing nothing. Not because they don’t care – but because they don’t know where to start. That’s exactly the problem we solve with Violation Summarization and Prioritization in Nirmata Control Hub. With Nirmata Control Hub, you don’t have to dig through pages of findings and all the time spent therein. With a timely glance, you get a summary report for your entire cluster or specific namespaces, showing: Total number of violations Affected namespaces Top security risks Recommended actions Nirmata Control Hub won’t just tell you what’s wrong. We prioritize violations into clear buckets: 🔥 Priority 1: Immediate Attention High-impact misconfigurations that expose your workloads to real risk – fix these ASAP. 🚨 Priority 2: Important but Not Urgent Still important, but can be queued up for your next sprint. ℹ️ Priority 3: Minor / Best Practices Clean-up tasks and optimizations – ideal for long-term hygiene.</description></item><item><title>More resilient, flexible networking for the cloud workloads that matter</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-06-26-more-resilient-flexible-networking-for-the-cloud-workloads-that-matter/</link><pubDate>Thu, 26 Jun 2025 16:50:42 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-06-26-more-resilient-flexible-networking-for-the-cloud-workloads-that-matter/</guid><description>More resilient, flexible networking for the cloud workloads that matter Partner Network Connect now supports high availability and DOKS Reserved IPv6 on Droplets Bring Your Own IP (BYOIP) Public preview Watch the webinar to scale smarter with all Q2 2025 IaaS updates About the author(s) Try DigitalOcean for free Related Articles Announcing OpenAI gpt-oss Models on the DigitalOcean Gradientâ¢ AI Platform Build smarter AI agents: new tools now available for the DigitalOcean Gradientâ¢ AI Platform Introducing GPU Droplets accelerated by NVIDIA HGX H200 By Anantha Ramachandran and Udhay Ravindran Published: June 26, 2025 5 min read Building and scaling cloud infrastructure often means navigating fragile network configurations, unpredictable IP behavior, and rigid networking provider limitations. Whether itâs dealing with flaky multi-cloud connections, scrambling to update IP allow-lists after a restart, or hesitating to migrate workloads due to reputation-bound IPs, these challenges add unnecessary risk and complexity to modern deployments. Weâre excited to announce three new updates designed to simplify cloud networking and enhance deployment flexibility: Partner Network Connect supports high availability and DOKS, general availability of Reserved IPv6 on Droplets, and public preview of Bring Your Own IP (BYOIP). These improvements address real-world infrastructure challenges and are built with simplicity, scalability, and reliability in mind. Multi-cloud architectures are great, until the private links between them become a single point of failure. For teams routing traffic between multiple cloud providers like DigitalOcean, AWS, Microsoft Azure, or Google Cloud Platform, even brief disruptions can stall ML pipelines, gaming platforms, or analytics services. Traditional setups offer limited redundancy, and recovering from outages usually involves manual intervention or rerouting traffic over public networks. High Availability for Partner Network Connect helps solve this by letting you provision redundant links across two separate DigitalOcean gateway routers. Traffic automatically fails over if one link goes down, with no manual steps required and no impact to your customers. With fully managed failover, this update removes operational overhead while helping meet the needs of latency-sensitive or distributed systems. Key benefits include: Automatic failover: Eliminate downtime from single link failures.

It is common practice to require the use of specific versions of the kernel, its configuration, device drivers, or system components. Despite the existence of the Open Container Initiative (OCI) , a governing community to define standards and specifications for container images, there has been a gap in expression of such compatibility requirements. The need to address this issue has led to different proposals and, ultimately, an implementation in Kubernetes&amp;rsquo; Node Feature Discovery (NFD). NFD is an open source Kubernetes project that automatically detects and reports hardware and system features of cluster nodes. This information helps users to schedule workloads on nodes that meet specific system requirements, which is especially useful for applications with strict hardware or operating system dependencies. A container image is built on a base image, which provides a minimal runtime environment, often a stripped-down Linux userland, completely empty or distroless. When an application requires certain features from the host OS, compatibility issues arise. These dependencies can manifest in several ways: Drivers : Host driver versions must match the supported range of a library version inside the container to avoid compatibility problems. Examples include GPUs and network drivers. Libraries or Software : The container must come with a specific version or range of versions for a library or software to run optimally in the environment. Examples from high performance computing are MPI, EFA, or Infiniband.</description></item><item><title>See More, Worry Less: Managed Database Observability, Monitoring, and Hardening Advancements</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-06-24-see-more-worry-less-managed-database-observability-monitoring-and-hardening-adva/</link><pubDate>Tue, 24 Jun 2025 17:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-06-24-see-more-worry-less-managed-database-observability-monitoring-and-hardening-adva/</guid><description>See More, Worry Less: Managed Database Observability, Monitoring, and Hardening Advancements Whatâs new?

In this guide, we will break down what microservices are, how they operate, their advantages, key components, and best practices, offering a comprehensive overview for anyone looking to understand this modern architectural approach. Microservices architecture allows applications to be built as a collection of independent, modular services that enhance scalability and flexibility. Key components of microservices include API gateways, service registries, and individual data stores for each service, which streamline communication and data management. While microservices offer advantages like fault isolation and faster development cycles, they also introduce complexity and require robust tools for management and orchestration. Microservices are an architectural style that organizes an application as a collection of small, independently deployable services. Unlike traditional monolithic architectures, where a single service encapsulates all functionalities, microservices based applications break down applications into individual services, each focusing on a specific business capability. This modularity allows for independent deployment and scaling, making microservice architecture a popular choice for modern applications, particularly when considering internal microservices. One of the key characteristics of microservices is their cloud-native approach. Each service operates independently but is part of a larger application framework, often utilizing cloud resources to ensure scalability and fault tolerance.</description></item><item><title>Blog: Changes to Kubernetes Slack</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-06-16-blog-changes-to-kubernetes-slack/</link><pubDate>Mon, 16 Jun 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-06-16-blog-changes-to-kubernetes-slack/</guid><description>Changes to Kubernetes Slack UPDATE : We’ve received notice from Salesforce that our Slack workspace WILL NOT BE DOWNGRADED on June 20th.

What Is Kubernetes? Finally, a Simple Explanation! This capability ensures your application remains responsive and performs well under varying traffic loads. In this article, we will cover the basics of Kubernetes HPA, how it works, best practices, and a hands-on example to help you master this critical Kubernetes feature. The Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA) automatically adjusts the number of pod replicas in Kubernetes based on CPU and memory metrics, ensuring stable application performance under varying loads. Proper setup of the Metrics Server is essential, as it provides the necessary resource metrics for HPA to make informed scaling decisions; accurate HPA configuration specifies minimum and maximum replicas along with target utilization. Integrating HPA with other autoscalers such as the Vertical Pod Autoscaler (VPA) and Cluster Autoscaler enhances scaling strategies, allowing for efficient resource management and responsiveness to varying application demands. At its core, the Kubernetes Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA) is a Kubernetes resource that automatically adjusts the number of pod replicas based on observed CPU and memory usage metrics. This dynamic adjustment ensures your application maintains stable performance even as traffic fluctuates, making it a critical component for production workloads. Horizontal pod autoscaling HPA operates by continuously monitoring specified metrics and making scaling decisions to match the demand. The HPA utilizes resource metrics like CPU and memory, as well as custom metrics and cpu metrics, to determine the appropriate number of replicas needed. For example, if the average CPU utilization exceeds a predefined threshold, HPA will increase the number of replicas to distribute the load. Conversely, when the demand decreases, HPA reduces the number of replicas, optimizing resource usage and reducing costs. Additionally, the custom metrics api can be leveraged to enhance monitoring capabilities.</description></item><item><title>kubectl logs: How to Get Pod Logs in Kubernetes (With Examples)</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-06-14-kubectl-logs-how-to-get-pod-logs-in-kubernetes-with-examples/</link><pubDate>Sat, 14 Jun 2025 14:09:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-06-14-kubectl-logs-how-to-get-pod-logs-in-kubernetes-with-examples/</guid><description>Prerequisites Create a Pod How to View Pod Logs View Pod logs in real time Fetch a specific number of lines of Pod logs View logs of an exited container Fetch Pod logs from a specific time period Fetch the logs of a specific container in a multi-container Pod Conclusion Exploring System Architecture for DevOps Engineers Why KubeCon India 2025 Meant More to KodeKloud Linux: List Disks Linux: &amp;ldquo;cat&amp;rdquo; Command Linux Made Easy for DevOps Beginners From CFP to Stage: Win Your Tech Talk Slot MCP Explained Simply: How AI Can Actually Do Things Now Still Not Job-Ready After Learning DevOps?

This blog post explores how to build custom event aggregation systems that help engineering teams better understand cluster behavior and troubleshoot issues more effectively. In a Kubernetes cluster, events are generated for various operations - from pod scheduling and container starts to volume mounts and network configurations. While these events are invaluable for debugging and monitoring, several challenges emerge in production environments: Volume : Large clusters can generate thousands of events per minute Retention : Default event retention is limited to one hour Correlation : Related events from different components are not automatically linked Classification : Events lack standardized severity or category classifications Aggregation : Similar events are not automatically grouped To learn more about Events in Kubernetes, read the Event API reference. Consider a production environment with tens of microservices where the users report intermittent transaction failures: Traditional event aggregation process: Engineers are wasting hours sifting through thousands of standalone events spread across namespaces. By the time they look into it, the older events have long since purged, and correlating pod restarts to node-level issues is practically impossible. With its event aggregation in its custom events: The system groups events across resources, instantly surfacing correlation patterns such as volume mount timeouts before pod restarts. History indicates it occurred during past record traffic spikes, highlighting a storage scalability issue in minutes rather than hours. The beneﬁt of this approach is that organizations that implement it commonly cut down their troubleshooting time significantly along with increasing the reliability of systems by detecting patterns early. This post explores how to build a custom event aggregation system that addresses these challenges, aligned to Kubernetes best practices. I&amp;rsquo;ve picked the Go programming language for my example. This event aggregation system consists of three main components: Event Watcher : Monitors the Kubernetes API for new events Event Processor : Processes, categorizes, and correlates events Storage Backend : Stores processed events for longer retention Here&amp;rsquo;s a sketch for how to implement the event watcher: package main import ( &amp;ldquo;context&amp;rdquo; metav1 &amp;ldquo;k8s.</description></item><item><title>Introducing Serverless Inference on the GenAI Platform</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-06-09-introducing-serverless-inference-on-the-genai-platform/</link><pubDate>Mon, 09 Jun 2025 17:48:18 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-06-09-introducing-serverless-inference-on-the-genai-platform/</guid><description>Introducing Serverless Inference on the GenAI Platform A simpler way to integrate AI Ideal use cases Start building today About the author Try DigitalOcean for free Related Articles Announcing OpenAI gpt-oss Models on the DigitalOcean Gradientâ¢ AI Platform Build smarter AI agents: new tools now available for the DigitalOcean Gradientâ¢ AI Platform Introducing GPU Droplets accelerated by NVIDIA HGX H200 By Grace Morgan Updated: June 9, 2025 2 min read DigitalOceanâs GenAI Platform is now DigitalOcean Gradient Platform.

What Is Kubernetes? Finally, a Simple Explanation! Since its debut in 2014, Kubernetes has seen a meteoric rise in its adoption and popularity. Despite being a relatively new technology, it is now used by a vast number of organizations, from small start-ups to large enterprises, so much so that it has become a standard in the industry. Kubernetes benefits from strong community support and boasts a rich ecosystem of tools and extensions. It is continuously being developed and improved, and judging by the current trends, Kubernetes is only going to get stronger in the future. In this blog post, we’ll discuss why you should consider using Kubernetes , scenarios where Kubernetes might not be the ideal solution, and explore some of its alternatives. Let’s get started! Kubernetes offers several key features that cater to a wide range of application deployment and management needs. Here are the top three features of Kubernetes that make it particularly suitable for modern software development: In recent years, the microservices approach ( where software systems are developed as a collection of small, independent services ) has become increasingly popular in software development. Kubernetes provides many abstractions and APIs that are particularly well-suited to the requirements and characteristics of a microservices architecture. Here&amp;rsquo;s how Kubernetes simplifies the deployment and management of microservices: Containerization support : Kubernetes is designed to manage containers, which are ideal for microservices.

Unlike typical short-lived, stateless web requests, LLM inference sessions are often long-running, resource-intensive, and partially stateful. For example, a single GPU-backed model server may keep multiple inference sessions active and maintain in-memory token caches. Traditional load balancers focused on HTTP path or round-robin lack the specialized capabilities needed for these workloads. They also don’t account for model identity or request criticality (e. g. , interactive chat vs. batch jobs). Gateway API Inference Extension was created to address this gap by building on the existing Gateway API , adding inference-specific routing capabilities while retaining the familiar model of Gateways and HTTPRoutes. By adding an inference extension to your existing gateway, you effectively transform it into an Inference Gateway , enabling you to self-host GenAI/LLMs with a “model-as-a-service” mindset. The project’s goal is to improve and standardize routing to inference workloads across the ecosystem. Key objectives include enabling model-aware routing, supporting per-request criticalities, facilitating safe model roll-outs, and optimizing load balancing based on real-time model metrics.</description></item><item><title>Introducing ATL1: DigitalOcean’s new AI-optimized data center in Atlanta</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-06-03-introducing-atl1-digitalocean-s-new-ai-optimized-data-center-in-atlanta/</link><pubDate>Tue, 03 Jun 2025 12:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-06-03-introducing-atl1-digitalocean-s-new-ai-optimized-data-center-in-atlanta/</guid><description>Introducing ATL1: DigitalOceanâs new AI-optimized data center in Atlanta Built to power the future of AI/ML Bringing Cloud and AI infrastructure closer to the Southern U.

We are also pleased to announce that there are already a number of conformant implementations to try, made possible by postponing this blog announcement. Version 1.3.0 of the API was released about a month ago on April 24, 2025. Gateway API v1.3.0 brings a new feature to the Standard channel (Gateway API&amp;rsquo;s GA release channel): percentage-based request mirroring , and introduces three new experimental features: cross-origin resource sharing (CORS) filters, a standardized mechanism for listener and gateway merging, and retry budgets. Also see the full release notes and applaud the v1.3.0 release team next time you see them. Graduation to the Standard channel is a notable achievement for Gateway API features, as inclusion in the Standard release channel denotes a high level of confidence in the API surface and provides guarantees of backward compatibility. Of course, as with any other Kubernetes API, Standard channel features can continue to evolve with backward-compatible additions over time, and we (SIG Network) certainly expect further refinements and improvements in the future. For more information on how all of this works, refer to the Gateway API Versioning Policy. Leads: Lior Lieberman , Jake Bennert GEP-3171: Percentage-Based Request Mirroring Percentage-based request mirroring is an enhancement to the existing support for HTTP request mirroring , which allows HTTP requests to be duplicated to another backend using the RequestMirror filter type. Request mirroring is particularly useful in blue-green deployment. It can be used to assess the impact of request scaling on application performance without impacting responses to clients. The previous mirroring capability worked on all the requests to a backendRef. Percentage-based request mirroring allows users to specify a subset of requests they want to be mirrored, either by percentage or fraction.</description></item><item><title>Leveling Up Policy Enforcement in Kubernetes: A Look at Kyverno 1.14 and CEL</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-05-29-leveling-up-policy-enforcement-in-kubernetes-a-look-at-kyverno-1-14-and-cel/</link><pubDate>Thu, 29 May 2025 17:37:06 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-05-29-leveling-up-policy-enforcement-in-kubernetes-a-look-at-kyverno-1-14-and-cel/</guid><description>Leveling Up Policy Enforcement in Kubernetes: A Look at Kyverno 1.14 and CEL What is Kyverno? Evolving Challenges and the Rise of CEL Introducing New Policy Types in Kyverno 1.14 Validating Policy Image Validating Policy Future Directions Kyverno’s Strengths Recently, Cloud Native Live featured a session diving into the powerful integration of Common Expression Language (CEL) in Kyverno 1.14. Hosted by Eric Durmishi and presented by Kyverno maintainers Mariam Fahmy and Charles Edward, the session introduced exciting new capabilities that enhance Kyverno’s flexibility and consistency as a policy engine for Kubernetes. At its core, Kyverno is a policy engine for Kubernetes. It enables you to define policies for validating, mutating, generating, or verifying images for resources within your cluster. When an API request, like creating a Pod, is sent to the Kubernetes API server, it passes through several stages, including authentication and authorization. Kyverno integrates as an admission webhook. The API request is forwarded to the Kyverno server, which fetches relevant policies, applies them to the resource, and then either accepts or rejects the request based on whether the resource violates the policy. Kyverno also includes components such as the Reports Controller, which generates policy reports to visualize policy results, and a Cleanup Controller, which manages unused resources based on cleanup policies. Traditionally, Kyverno used a single policy type with different rule types nested within it, such as validate, mutate, generate, and verifyImages. Policies could define rules to match or exclude specific resources. For validation, you could use patterns, deny rules, Pod Security subrules, or assertion trees. If a resource violated a policy, Kyverno’s action was determined by the failureAction field, which could be set to enforce (reject the request) or audit (allow the request, generating a warning and a policy report).</description></item><item><title>No More kubectl Commands — Just Talk to Your Kubernetes Cluster in Natural Language</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-05-28-no-more-kubectl-commands-just-talk-to-your-kubernetes-cluster-in-natural-languag/</link><pubDate>Wed, 28 May 2025 17:52:01 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-05-28-no-more-kubectl-commands-just-talk-to-your-kubernetes-cluster-in-natural-languag/</guid><description>Getting Started Install kubectl-ai in Seconds Example 1: Get the Pod Count — Just Ask Example 2: Launch an Nginx Pod in Seconds Example 3: Ask for Nginx Pod Details—No Commands Needed Why This Changes the Game Key Takeaway Exploring System Architecture for DevOps Engineers Why KubeCon India 2025 Meant More to KodeKloud Linux: List Disks Linux: &amp;ldquo;cat&amp;rdquo; Command Linux Made Easy for DevOps Beginners From CFP to Stage: Win Your Tech Talk Slot MCP Explained Simply: How AI Can Actually Do Things Now Still Not Job-Ready After Learning DevOps?

The launch of ChatGPT was a seminal moment in the evolution of AI, and since then, AIâs adoption has accelerated. According to â The rapid adoption of Generative AI. Bick, Blandin, &amp;amp; Deming (2024 )â, AI is being adopted at twice the rate of the PC and internet at a similar point in their evolution. Not just adoption, the rate of innovation in AI has been faster than anything we have seen before. So where is AI headed? To answer this question, let us start by looking at how other transformational technologies have evolved throughout history. Take the Internet for example â it started with the infrastructure - with routers and network switches. But the true inflection point came with the emergence of platform capabilities, such as web browsers and HTML, which allowed people to build and use applications like search engines, e-commerce, and social media. If you look at the PC, microprocessors and memory and other infrastructure components came first. But what triggered the massive adoption was the creation of a platform â WinTel, which provided a standardized environment for developing and running PC applications. Same with the smartphones; the infrastructure started first with modems and cell towers, but it really took off when a platform enabled the creation and use of applications. AI will follow a similar IPA ( I nfrastructure -&amp;gt; P latform -&amp;gt; A pplication) model, with the innovation moving from Infrastructure (e.</description></item><item><title>Kubernetes v1.33: In-Place Pod Resize Graduated to Beta</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-05-16-kubernetes-v1-33-in-place-pod-resize-graduated-to-beta/</link><pubDate>Fri, 16 May 2025 10:30:00 -0800</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-05-16-kubernetes-v1-33-in-place-pod-resize-graduated-to-beta/</guid><description>Kubernetes v1.33: In-Place Pod Resize Graduated to Beta What is in-place Pod resize? Why does in-place Pod resize matter? What&amp;rsquo;s changed between Alpha and Beta? Notable user-facing changes Stability and reliability enhancements What&amp;rsquo;s next? Getting started and providing feedback On behalf of the Kubernetes project, I am excited to announce that the in-place Pod resize feature (also known as In-Place Pod Vertical Scaling), first introduced as alpha in Kubernetes v1.27, has graduated to Beta and will be enabled by default in the Kubernetes v1.33 release! This marks a significant milestone in making resource management for Kubernetes workloads more flexible and less disruptive. Traditionally, changing the CPU or memory resources allocated to a container required restarting the Pod. While acceptable for many stateless applications, this could be disruptive for stateful services, batch jobs, or any workloads sensitive to restarts. In-place Pod resizing allows you to change the CPU and memory requests and limits assigned to containers within a running Pod, often without requiring a container restart. Here&amp;rsquo;s the core idea: The spec. containers[&lt;em&gt;]. resources field in a Pod specification now represents the desired resources and is mutable for CPU and memory. spec. containers[&lt;/em&gt;]. resources The status. containerStatuses[*]. resources field reflects the actual resources currently configured on a running container.</description></item><item><title>Announcing etcd v3.6.0</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-05-15-announcing-etcd-v3-6-0/</link><pubDate>Thu, 15 May 2025 16:00:00 -0800</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-05-15-announcing-etcd-v3-6-0/</guid><description>Announcing etcd v3.6.0 Security Features Migration to v3store Downgrade Feature gates livez / readyz checks v3discovery Performance Memory Throughput Breaking changes Peer endpoints no longer serve client requests Clear boundary between etcdctl and etcdutl Critical bug fixes Upgrade issue Testing Platforms Dependencies Dependency bumping guide Core Dependency Updates grpc-gateway@v2 grpc-ecosystem/go-grpc-middleware/providers/prometheus Community etcd Becomes a Kubernetes SIG New contributors, maintainers, and reviewers Introducing the etcd Operator Working Group Future Development This announcement originally appeared on the etcd blog.

In batch workloads, you might want to use leader-follower patterns like MPI , in which the leader controls the execution, including the followers&amp;rsquo; lifecycle. In this case, you might want to mark it as succeeded even if some of the indexes failed. Unfortunately, a leader-follower Kubernetes Job that didn&amp;rsquo;t use a success policy, in most cases, would have to require all Pods to finish successfully for that Job to reach an overall succeeded state. For Kubernetes Jobs, the API allows you to specify the early exit criteria using the. spec. successPolicy field (you can only use the. spec. successPolicy field for an indexed Job ).

Kubernetes v1.33 introduces a few updates to the lifecycle of containers. The Sleep action for container lifecycle hooks now supports a zero sleep duration (feature enabled by default). There is also alpha support for customizing the stop signal sent to containers when they are being terminated. This blog post goes into the details of these new aspects of the container lifecycle, and how you can use them. Kubernetes v1.29 introduced the Sleep action for container PreStop and PostStart Lifecycle hooks. The Sleep action lets your containers pause for a specified duration after the container is started or before it is terminated. This was needed to provide a straightforward way to manage graceful shutdowns. Before the Sleep action, folks used to run the sleep command using the exec action in their container lifecycle hooks. If you wanted to do this you&amp;rsquo;d need to have the binary for the sleep command in your container image. This is difficult if you&amp;rsquo;re using third party images.

With Nirmata Control Hub’s Jira integration, you can automatically or manually create Jira tickets for policy violations directly from the platform. This ensures accountability, reduces MTTR (mean time to resolution), and improves team productivity by embedding policy compliance into your teams’ tools. Every misconfiguration or policy violation is a potential security or compliance risk. However, identifying issues is only the first step. The real value is in closing the loop—from detection to resolution. Traditionally, teams rely on Slack alerts, dashboards, or Excel exports to track violations. But these quickly fall out of sync with what’s happening in the cluster or Git. Hira is where real work happens, and that’s where Nirmata Control Hub (NCH) now meets your team. From any Policy Reports page, users can instantly generate a Jira issue for violations. Simply click “Create Jira Issue” and fill in the ticket details, such as project, title, issue type, priority, and assignee. This creates traceability right at the source of the ossie, whether it;s a misconfigured deployment, a missing securityContext, or a policy deviation.</description></item><item><title>Why Policy as Code is a Game Changer for Platform Engineers</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-05-13-why-policy-as-code-is-a-game-changer-for-platform-engineers/</link><pubDate>Tue, 13 May 2025 20:07:21 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-05-13-why-policy-as-code-is-a-game-changer-for-platform-engineers/</guid><description>Why Policy as Code is a Game Changer for Platform Engineers Empower Developers with Faster Feedback Enable Secure Self-Service Achieve Unprecedented Transparency Boost Efficiency and Scalability Ensure Consistent and Standardized Environments Automate Governance and Security Fortify Your Security Posture Streamline Compliance Effortlessly The Future of Platforms is Policy as Code Explore More About Platform Engineering Trends and Best Practices Platform engineers, let’s talk about a fundamental shift that’s revolutionizing how we build and manage internal developer platforms: Policy as Code (PaC). This isn’t just another buzzword; it’s the key to creating scalable, secure, and efficient operations that empower developers. Let’s dive in! Platform engineers, let’s talk about a fundamental shift that’s revolutionizing how we build and manage internal developer platforms: Policy as Code (PaC). This isn’t just another buzzword; it’s the key to creating scalable, secure, and efficient operations that empower developers. Let’s dive in! Policy as Code drastically improves developer experience. By implementing policy checks early in the development process (“shifting left”), developers get instant feedback on potential issues. This prevents problems from reaching production and reduces mental load, allowing them to focus on innovation, not compliance headaches. Platform engineering is about giving developers self-service capabilities. Infrastructure as Code (IaC) provides automation, but Policy as Code (PaC) provides the critical guardrails. Developers can provision resources and deploy applications within defined “golden paths,” ensuring agility without compromising security or compliance. Policies written as code are stored in version control, creating a clear history of changes. This auditability is essential for troubleshooting and demonstrating compliance.</description></item><item><title>Kubernetes v1.33: Job's Backoff Limit Per Index Goes GA</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-05-13-kubernetes-v1-33-job-s-backoff-limit-per-index-goes-ga/</link><pubDate>Tue, 13 May 2025 10:30:00 -0800</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-05-13-kubernetes-v1-33-job-s-backoff-limit-per-index-goes-ga/</guid><description>Kubernetes v1.33: Job&amp;rsquo;s Backoff Limit Per Index Goes GA About backoff limit per index How backoff limit per index works Example Learn more Get involved In Kubernetes v1.33, the Backoff Limit Per Index feature reaches general availability (GA). This blog describes the Backoff Limit Per Index feature and its benefits. When you run workloads on Kubernetes, you must consider scenarios where Pod failures can affect the completion of your workloads. Ideally, your workload should tolerate transient failures and continue running. To achieve failure tolerance in a Kubernetes Job, you can set the spec. backoffLimit field. This field specifies the total number of tolerated failures. spec. backoffLimit However, for workloads where every index is considered independent, like embarassingly parallel workloads - the spec. backoffLimit field is often not flexible enough. For example, you may choose to run multiple suites of integration tests by representing each suite as an index within an Indexed Job. In that setup, a fast-failing index (test suite) is likely to consume your entire budget for tolerating Pod failures, and you might not be able to run the other indexes.</description></item><item><title>Kubernetes v1.33: Image Pull Policy the way you always thought it worked!</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-05-12-kubernetes-v1-33-image-pull-policy-the-way-you-always-thought-it-worked/</link><pubDate>Mon, 12 May 2025 10:30:00 -0800</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-05-12-kubernetes-v1-33-image-pull-policy-the-way-you-always-thought-it-worked/</guid><description>Kubernetes v1.33: Image Pull Policy the way you always thought it worked!

How to get involved Some things in Kubernetes are surprising, and the way imagePullPolicy behaves might be one of them. Given Kubernetes is all about running pods, it may be peculiar to learn that there has been a caveat to restricting pod access to authenticated images for over 10 years in the form of issue 18787 ! It is an exciting release when you can resolve a ten-year-old issue. imagePullPolicy The gist of the problem is that the imagePullPolicy: IfNotPresent strategy has done precisely what it says, and nothing more. Let&amp;rsquo;s set up a scenario. To begin, Pod A in Namespace X is scheduled to Node 1 and requires image Foo from a private repository. For it&amp;rsquo;s image pull authentication material, the pod references Secret 1 in its imagePullSecrets. Secret 1 contains the necessary credentials to pull from the private repository. The Kubelet will utilize the credentials from Secret 1 as supplied by Pod A and it will pull container image Foo from the registry. This is the intended (and secure) behavior. imagePullPolicy: IfNotPresent imagePullSecrets But now things get curious. If Pod B in Namespace Y happens to also be scheduled to Node 1 , unexpected (and potentially insecure) things happen. Pod B may reference the same private image, specifying the IfNotPresent image pull policy.</description></item><item><title>How to optimize your cloud architecture for business growth</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-05-09-how-to-optimize-your-cloud-architecture-for-business-growth/</link><pubDate>Fri, 09 May 2025 23:25:48 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-05-09-how-to-optimize-your-cloud-architecture-for-business-growth/</guid><description>How to optimize your cloud architecture for business growth How cloud architecture reviews can benefit you Tips to boost cloud performance and security Tips to save money and grow efficiently How DigitalOcean experts help: A real-world example Optimize your cloud to empower your business About the author Try DigitalOcean for free Related Articles Introducing langchain-gradient: Seamless LangChain Integration with DigitalOcean Gradientâ¢ AI Platform Agentic Cloud: Reinventing the Cloud with AI Agents Choosing the Right DigitalOcean Offering for Your AI/ML Workload By Anantha Ramachandran Principal Product Marketing Manager Published: May 9, 2025 5 min read Your cloud setup is like a ship on the ocean.

One of the most challenging aspects of operating large-scale clusters has been handling List requests that fetch substantial datasets - a common operation that could unexpectedly impact your cluster&amp;rsquo;s stability. Today, the Kubernetes community is excited to announce a significant architectural improvement: streaming encoding for List responses. Current API response encoders just serialize an entire response into a single contiguous memory and perform one ResponseWriter. Write call to transmit data to the client. Despite HTTP/2&amp;rsquo;s capability to split responses into smaller frames for transmission, the underlying HTTP server continues to hold the complete response data as a single buffer. Even as individual frames are transmitted to the client, the memory associated with these frames cannot be freed incrementally. When cluster size grows, the single response body can be substantial - like hundreds of megabytes in size. At large scale, the current approach becomes particularly inefficient, as it prevents incremental memory release during transmission. Imagining that when network congestion occurs, that large response body’s memory block stays active for tens of seconds or even minutes. This limitation leads to unnecessarily high and prolonged memory consumption in the kube-apiserver process. If multiple large List requests occur simultaneously, the cumulative memory consumption can escalate rapidly, potentially leading to an Out-of-Memory (OOM) situation that compromises cluster stability.</description></item><item><title>Kubernetes 1.33: Volume Populators Graduate to GA</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-05-08-kubernetes-1-33-volume-populators-graduate-to-ga/</link><pubDate>Thu, 08 May 2025 10:30:00 -0800</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-05-08-kubernetes-1-33-volume-populators-graduate-to-ga/</guid><description>Kubernetes 1.33: Volume Populators Graduate to GA What is new Populator Pod is optional Mutator functions to modify the Kubernetes resources Flexible metric handling for providers Clean up for temporary resources How to use it Future directions and potential feature requests Kubernetes volume populators are now generally available (GA)! The AnyVolumeDataSource feature gate is treated as always enabled for Kubernetes v1.33, which means that users can specify any appropriate custom resource as the data source of a PersistentVolumeClaim (PVC). AnyVolumeDataSource An example of how to use dataSourceRef in PVC: apiVersion : v1 kind : PersistentVolumeClaim metadata : name : pvc1 spec :. dataSourceRef : apiGroup : provider. example. com kind : Provider name : provider1 apiVersion : v1 kind : PersistentVolumeClaim metadata : name : pvc1 spec :. dataSourceRef : apiGroup : provider. example. com kind : Provider name : provider1 There are four major enhancements from beta. During the beta phase, contributors to Kubernetes identified potential resource leaks with PersistentVolumeClaim (PVC) deletion while volume population was in progress; these leaks happened due to limitations in finalizer handling. Ahead of the graduation to general availability, the Kubernetes project added support to delete temporary resources (PVC prime, etc. ) if the original PVC is deleted. To accommodate this, we&amp;rsquo;ve introduced three new plugin-based functions: PopulateFn() : Executes the provider-specific data population logic.</description></item><item><title>Expanding our GPU Droplet portfolio - NVIDIA RTX 4000 Ada Generation, NVIDIA RTX 6000 Ada Generation, and NVIDIA L40S</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-05-08-expanding-our-gpu-droplet-portfolio-nvidia-rtx-4000-ada-generation-nvidia-rtx-60/</link><pubDate>Thu, 08 May 2025 08:05:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-05-08-expanding-our-gpu-droplet-portfolio-nvidia-rtx-4000-ada-generation-nvidia-rtx-60/</guid><description>Expanding our GPU Droplet portfolio - NVIDIA RTX 4000 Ada Generation, NVIDIA RTX 6000 Ada Generation, and NVIDIA L40S About the author Try DigitalOcean for free Related Articles Announcing OpenAI gpt-oss Models on the DigitalOcean Gradientâ¢ AI Platform Build smarter AI agents: new tools now available for the DigitalOcean Gradientâ¢ AI Platform Introducing GPU Droplets accelerated by NVIDIA HGX H200 By Waverly Swinton Published: May 8, 2025 2 min read GPU Droplets are now DigitalOcean GradientAI GPU Droplets.

By keeping infrastructure and cost management simple, the Hatch program helps enable startups to build solutions that move society forward. Ontra Mobility , a Y Combinator startup, transforms communities by developing data-driven tools that help cities and transit agencies plan and operate more efficient, equitable, and sustainable transportation systems, focusing on optimizing networks and improving first-and-last mile access through on-demand ridesharing. We sat down with CTO Connor Riley, who chose DigitalOcean for its simple, managed infrastructure so they can focus on making public transit more accessible. The Hatch program provided credits and resources that helped support their mission. During their PhD programs at Georgia Institute of Technology, Riley and his co-founder Anthony Trasatti worked with their academic advisor, Pascal Van Hentenryck, to optimize public transit, which serves as a vital lifeline for many. Working closely with MARTA in Atlanta, GA, they developed techniques for network design optimization, special events scheduling, and dispatching algorithms for on-demand ridesharing. These projects powered on-demand ridesharing pilots MARTA Reach and CAT SMART in Savannah, Georgia. Getting adoption for a product that serves public agencies is as much of a battle as building the product itself. Since many residents rely on public transportation, establishing trust with transit agencies is essential before theyâll risk adopting new products that could impact municipal residents. Despite these hurdles, theyâre undeterred: theyâve already gained traction with a number of customers, including conducting a microtransit planning project in Washington D.

Service Account tokens for credential providers 2. Image registry authentication flow Benefits of this approach What&amp;rsquo;s next? Try it out How to get involved Kubernetes has steadily evolved to reduce reliance on long-lived credentials stored in the API. A prime example of this shift is the transition of Kubernetes Service Account (KSA) tokens from long-lived, static tokens to ephemeral, automatically rotated tokens with OpenID Connect (OIDC)-compliant semantics. This advancement enables workloads to securely authenticate with external services without needing persistent secrets. However, one major gap remains: image pull authentication. Today, Kubernetes clusters rely on image pull secrets stored in the API, which are long-lived and difficult to rotate, or on node-level kubelet credential providers, which allow any pod running on a node to access the same credentials. This presents security and operational challenges. To address this, Kubernetes is introducing Service Account Token Integration for Kubelet Credential Providers , now available in alpha. This enhancement allows credential providers to use pod-specific service account tokens to obtain registry credentials, which kubelet can then use for image pulls — eliminating the need for long-lived image pull secrets. Currently, Kubernetes administrators have two primary options for handling private container image pulls: Image pull secrets stored in the Kubernetes API These secrets are often long-lived because they are hard to rotate. They must be explicitly attached to a service account or pod.</description></item><item><title>Do You Need a Degree to Be a DevOps Engineer?

How It Works Designed for Developer Velocity and Platform Efficiency Where to Find It What’s Next Every modern enterprise strives for faster software delivery without compromising on security and compliance. As cloud-native environments grow in scale and complexity, so does the burden of identifying and fixing misconfigurations across clusters, pipelines, and cloud infrastructure. Today, we’re excited to announce a major leap forward in our mission to simplify cloud governance: AI-Powered Remediations , which is now available in preview in Nirmata Control Hub (NCH). Security and platform teams often face a growing backlog of policy violations—from missing labels to insecure container configurations to overly permissive network rules. Manually investigating each violation, understanding its root cause, and crafting a compliant fix takes time—and that time adds up. With AI Remediations, we’re dramatically reducing the Mean Time to Remediation (MTTR ). Instead of spending hours chasing down documentation or writing YAML from scratch, teams can now review and apply context-aware fixes in minutes. And the benefits go beyond speed: Dev teams are no longer blocked by vague policy errors. Instead, they receive concrete, explainable suggestions to fix issues early. Platform engineers can spend less time triaging violations and more time building scalable, reliable infrastructure. Security teams have peace of mind knowing issues aren’t just detected—they’re getting resolved faster than ever. Whether it’s a Deployment, ConfigMap, NetworkPolicy, or any Kubernetes resource, if it violates a rule enforced by your Kyverno policies in NCH, we can generate a fix.</description></item><item><title>Kubernetes v1.33: Prevent PersistentVolume Leaks When Deleting out of Order graduates to GA</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-05-05-kubernetes-v1-33-prevent-persistentvolume-leaks-when-deleting-out-of-order-gradu/</link><pubDate>Mon, 05 May 2025 10:30:00 -0800</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-05-05-kubernetes-v1-33-prevent-persistentvolume-leaks-when-deleting-out-of-order-gradu/</guid><description>Kubernetes v1.33: Prevent PersistentVolume Leaks When Deleting out of Order graduates to GA How did reclaim work in previous Kubernetes releases? PV reclaim policy with Kubernetes v1.33 How does it work? Important note How to enable new behavior? References How do I get involved? I am thrilled to announce that the feature to prevent PersistentVolume (or PVs for short) leaks when deleting out of order has graduated to General Availability (GA) in Kubernetes v1.33! This improvement, initially introduced as a beta feature in Kubernetes v1.31, ensures that your storage resources are properly reclaimed, preventing unwanted leaks. PersistentVolumeClaim (or PVC for short) is a user&amp;rsquo;s request for storage. A PV and PVC are considered Bound if a newly created PV or a matching PV is found. The PVs themselves are backed by volumes allocated by the storage backend. Normally, if the volume is to be deleted, then the expectation is to delete the PVC for a bound PV-PVC pair. However, there are no restrictions on deleting a PV before deleting a PVC. For a Bound PV-PVC pair, the ordering of PV-PVC deletion determines whether the PV reclaim policy is honored. The reclaim policy is honored if the PVC is deleted first; however, if the PV is deleted prior to deleting the PVC, then the reclaim policy is not exercised. As a result of this behavior, the associated storage asset in the external infrastructure is not removed. Bound With the graduation to GA in Kubernetes v1.33, this issue is now resolved. Kubernetes now reliably honors the configured Delete reclaim policy, even when PVs are deleted before their bound PVCs. This is achieved through the use of finalizers, ensuring that the storage backend releases the allocated storage resource as intended.</description></item><item><title>Nirmata Enterprise for Kyverno (N4K) Now Available on AWS Marketplace!</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-05-05-nirmata-enterprise-for-kyverno-n4k-now-available-on-aws-marketplace/</link><pubDate>Mon, 05 May 2025 17:55:11 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-05-05-nirmata-enterprise-for-kyverno-n4k-now-available-on-aws-marketplace/</guid><description>Nirmata Enterprise for Kyverno (N4K) Now Available on AWS Marketplace!

Kubernetes v1.33 introduces an alpha feature called mutable CSI node allocatable count , allowing Container Storage Interface (CSI) drivers to dynamically update the reported maximum number of volumes that a node can handle. This capability significantly enhances the accuracy of pod scheduling decisions and reduces scheduling failures caused by outdated volume capacity information. Traditionally, Kubernetes CSI drivers report a static maximum volume attachment limit when initializing. However, actual attachment capacities can change during a node&amp;rsquo;s lifecycle for various reasons, such as: Manual or external operations attaching/detaching volumes outside of Kubernetes control. Dynamically attached network interfaces or specialized hardware (GPUs, NICs, etc. ) consuming available slots. Multi-driver scenarios, where one CSI driver’s operations affect available capacity reported by another. Static reporting can cause Kubernetes to schedule pods onto nodes that appear to have capacity but don&amp;rsquo;t, leading to pods stuck in a ContainerCreating state. ContainerCreating With the new feature gate MutableCSINodeAllocatableCount , Kubernetes enables CSI drivers to dynamically adjust and report node attachment capacities at runtime. This ensures that the scheduler has the most accurate, up-to-date view of node capacity. MutableCSINodeAllocatableCount When this feature is enabled, Kubernetes supports two mechanisms for updating the reported node volume limits: Periodic Updates: CSI drivers specify an interval to periodically refresh the node&amp;rsquo;s allocatable capacity.</description></item><item><title>Kubernetes v1.33: New features in DRA</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-05-01-kubernetes-v1-33-new-features-in-dra/</link><pubDate>Thu, 01 May 2025 10:30:00 -0800</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-05-01-kubernetes-v1-33-new-features-in-dra/</guid><description>Kubernetes v1.33: New features in DRA Features promoted to beta New alpha features Preparing for general availability What’s next? Getting involved Acknowledgments Kubernetes Dynamic Resource Allocation (DRA) was originally introduced as an alpha feature in the v1.26 release, and then went through a significant redesign for Kubernetes v1.31. The main DRA feature went to beta in v1.32, and the project hopes it will be generally available in Kubernetes v1.34. The basic feature set of DRA provides a far more powerful and flexible API for requesting devices than Device Plugin. And while DRA remains a beta feature for v1.33, the DRA team has been hard at work implementing a number of new features and UX improvements. One feature has been promoted to beta, while a number of new features have been added in alpha. The team has also made progress towards getting DRA ready for GA. Driver-owned Resource Claim Status was promoted to beta. This allows the driver to report driver-specific device status data for each allocated device in a resource claim, which is particularly useful for supporting network devices. Partitionable Devices lets a driver advertise several overlapping logical devices (“partitions”), and the driver can reconfigure the physical device dynamically based on the actual devices allocated. This makes it possible to partition devices on-demand to meet the needs of the workloads and therefore increase the utilization. Device Taints and Tolerations allow devices to be tainted and for workloads to tolerate those taints. This makes it possible for drivers or cluster administrators to mark devices as unavailable.</description></item><item><title>Day 6: ConfigMaps &amp; Secrets — Managing App Settings and Sensitive Data in Kubernetes</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-05-01-day-6-configmaps-secrets-managing-app-settings-and-sensitive-data-in-kubernetes/</link><pubDate>Thu, 01 May 2025 18:11:50 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-05-01-day-6-configmaps-secrets-managing-app-settings-and-sensitive-data-in-kubernetes/</guid><description>Let’s Begin With What You Might Know What’s a ConfigMap?

This feature adds a scoring method for pod scheduling with the topology-aware volume provisioning. This feature eases to schedule pods on nodes with either the most or least available storage capacity. StorageCapacityScoring This feature extends the kube-scheduler&amp;rsquo;s VolumeBinding plugin to perform scoring using node storage capacity information obtained from Storage Capacity. Currently, you can only filter out nodes with insufficient storage capacity. So, you have to use a scheduler extender to achieve storage-capacity-based pod scheduling. This feature is useful for provisioning node-local PVs, which have size limits based on the node&amp;rsquo;s storage capacity. By using this feature, you can assign the PVs to the nodes with the most available storage space so that you can expand the PVs later as much as possible. In another use case, you might want to reduce the number of nodes as much as possible for low operation costs in cloud environments by choosing the least storage capacity node. This feature helps maximize resource utilization by filling up nodes more sequentially, starting with the most utilized nodes first that still have enough storage capacity for the requested volume size. In the alpha phase, StorageCapacityScoring is disabled by default. To use this feature, add StorageCapacityScoring=true to the kube-scheduler command line option &amp;ndash;feature-gates.</description></item><item><title>AI agent development just got easier on GenAI Platform</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-04-30-ai-agent-development-just-got-easier-on-genai-platform/</link><pubDate>Wed, 30 Apr 2025 15:30:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-04-30-ai-agent-development-just-got-easier-on-genai-platform/</guid><description>AI agent development just got easier on GenAI Platform Enhancing your AI agents Build smarter, more transparent AI agents About the author Try DigitalOcean for free Related Articles Announcing OpenAI gpt-oss Models on the DigitalOcean Gradientâ¢ AI Platform Build smarter AI agents: new tools now available for the DigitalOcean Gradientâ¢ AI Platform Introducing GPU Droplets accelerated by NVIDIA HGX H200 By Grace Morgan Published: April 30, 2025 2 min read DigitalOceanâs GenAI Platform is now DigitalOcean Gradient Platform.

What Is Kubernetes? Finally, a Simple Explanation! But here’s the next problem: You try running: kubectl get pods -o wide kubectl get pods -o wide And you see something like: NAME READY STATUS IP NODE myapp-xyz 1/1 Running 10.244.1.5 worker-node-1 NAME READY STATUS IP NODE myapp-xyz 1/1 Running 10.244.1.5 worker-node-1 Great — but: That Pod IP is internal It changes if the Pod dies and restarts And if you have 3 replicas… which IP do you even hit? That’s where Services come in. You can think of it as: A permanent IP address or DNS name inside the cluster A load balancer that routes traffic to the right Pods A gateway between your app and the outside world (if needed) You attach a Service to a set of Pods using labels The Service tracks the matching Pods — even as Pods come and go Kubernetes uses something called kube-proxy to route traffic to the correct Pod behind the scenes So even if Pods restart, the Service endpoint never changes. Let’s say you run 3 Pods of a web app with the label: app: myapp app: myapp You create a Service like this: selector: app: myapp selector: app: myapp Now, when someone accesses the Service: Kubernetes forwards the request to any of the healthy Pods It’s automatic, balanced, and reliable Imagine your app’s Pods are like food trucks moving around a festival ground. A Service is like the signpost that says: You don’t care where the trucks are parked — you just follow the sign. Kubernetes routes you to the right place, even if trucks come and go.

How do I use it? I want all the details! This post describes configurable tolerance for horizontal Pod autoscaling , a new alpha feature first available in Kubernetes 1.33. Horizontal Pod Autoscaling is a well-known Kubernetes feature that allows your workload to automatically resize by adding or removing replicas based on resource utilization. Let&amp;rsquo;s say you have a web application running in a Kubernetes cluster with 50 replicas. You configure the HorizontalPodAutoscaler (HPA) to scale based on CPU utilization, with a target of 75% utilization. Now, imagine that the current CPU utilization across all replicas is 90%, which is higher than the desired 75%. The HPA will calculate the required number of replicas using the formula: In this example: So, the HPA will increase the number of replicas from 50 to 60 to reduce the load on each pod. Similarly, if the CPU utilization were to drop below 75%, the HPA would scale down the number of replicas accordingly. The Kubernetes documentation provides a detailed description of the scaling algorithm. In order to avoid replicas being created or deleted whenever a small metric fluctuation occurs, Kubernetes applies a form of hysteresis: it only changes the number of replicas when the current and desired metric values differ by more than 10%. In the example above, since the ratio between the current and desired metric values is (90/75), or 20% above target, exceeding the 10% tolerance, the scale-up action will proceed. This default tolerance of 10% is cluster-wide; in older Kubernetes releases, it could not be fine-tuned. It&amp;rsquo;s a suitable value for most usage, but too coarse for large deployments, where a 10% tolerance represents tens of pods.</description></item><item><title>Kubernetes v1.33: User Namespaces enabled by default!</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-04-25-kubernetes-v1-33-user-namespaces-enabled-by-default/</link><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 10:30:00 -0800</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-04-25-kubernetes-v1-33-user-namespaces-enabled-by-default/</guid><description>Kubernetes v1.33: User Namespaces enabled by default! What is a user namespace? Demos Everything you wanted to know about user namespaces in Kubernetes Conclusions How do I get involved? In Kubernetes v1.33 support for user namespaces is enabled by default. This means that, when the stack requirements are met, pods can opt-in to use user namespaces. To use the feature there is no need to enable any Kubernetes feature flag anymore! In this blog post we answer some common questions about user namespaces. But, before we dive into that, let&amp;rsquo;s recap what user namespaces are and why they are important. Note: Linux user namespaces are a different concept from Kubernetes namespaces. The former is a Linux kernel feature; the latter is a Kubernetes feature. Linux provides different namespaces to isolate processes from each other. For example, a typical Kubernetes pod runs within a network namespace to isolate the network identity and a PID namespace to isolate the processes. One Linux namespace that was left behind is the user namespace. It isolates the UIDs and GIDs of the containers from the ones on the host. The identifiers in a container can be mapped to identifiers on the host in a way where host and container(s) never end up in overlapping UID/GIDs. Furthermore, the identifiers can be mapped to unprivileged, non-overlapping UIDs and GIDs on the host.</description></item><item><title>Introducing DigitalOcean Managed Caching for Valkey, The New Evolution of Managed Caching</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-04-24-introducing-digitalocean-managed-caching-for-valkey-the-new-evolution-of-managed/</link><pubDate>Thu, 24 Apr 2025 20:16:49 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-04-24-introducing-digitalocean-managed-caching-for-valkey-the-new-evolution-of-managed/</guid><description>Introducing DigitalOcean Managed Caching for Valkey, The New Evolution of Managed Caching Learn more about our new database offering: DigitalOcean Managed Caching for Valkey Benefits and features of Managed Caching for Valkey Where is Managed Caching going?

New Service features like dual-stack networking and traffic distribution are only supported via the EndpointSlice API, so all service proxies, Gateway API implementations, and similar controllers have had to be ported from using Endpoints to using EndpointSlices. At this point, the Endpoints API is really only there to avoid breaking end user workloads and scripts that still make use of it. As of Kubernetes 1.33, the Endpoints API is now officially deprecated, and the API server will return warnings to users who read or write Endpoints resources rather than using EndpointSlices. Eventually, the plan (as documented in KEP-4974 ) is to change the Kubernetes Conformance criteria to no longer require that clusters run the Endpoints controller (which generates Endpoints objects based on Services and Pods), to avoid doing work that is unneeded in most modern-day clusters. Thus, while the Kubernetes deprecation policy means that the Endpoints type itself will probably never completely go away, users who still have workloads or scripts that use the Endpoints API should start migrating them to EndpointSlices. For end users, the biggest change between the Endpoints API and the EndpointSlice API is that while every Service with a selector has exactly 1 Endpoints object (with the same name as the Service), a Service may have any number of EndpointSlices associated with it: selector $ kubectl get endpoints myservice Warning: v1 Endpoints is deprecated in v1.33+; use discovery. k8s. io/v1 EndpointSlice NAME ENDPOINTS AGE myservice 10.180.3.17:443 1h $ kubectl get endpointslice -l kubernetes. io/service-name = myservice NAME ADDRESSTYPE PORTS ENDPOINTS AGE myservice-7vzhx IPv4 443 10.180.3.17 21s myservice-jcv8s IPv6 443 2001:db8:0123::5 21s $ kubectl get endpoints myservice Warning: v1 Endpoints is deprecated in v1.33+; use discovery. k8s. io/v1 EndpointSlice NAME ENDPOINTS AGE myservice 10.180.3.17:443 1h $ kubectl get endpointslice -l kubernetes.</description></item><item><title>DigitalOcean Customers Eligible to Process DORA Workloads</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-04-24-digitalocean-customers-eligible-to-process-dora-workloads/</link><pubDate>Thu, 24 Apr 2025 12:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-04-24-digitalocean-customers-eligible-to-process-dora-workloads/</guid><description>DigitalOcean Customers Eligible to Process DORA Workloads What is DORA?

Additionally, we engaged Schellman &amp;amp; Company to facilitate an audit of our environment, so that customers can deploy on DigitalOcean with trust in the organizationâs risk management, security controls, operational resilience, incident management and reporting, and outsourcing and third party risk management. Effective January 17, 2025, financial entities operating in the European Union (EU) and Information and Communications Technology (ICT) third-party service providers are subject to the EUâs DORA. The regulation standardizes how financial entities report major ICT-related incidents, test their digital operational resilience, and manage ICT third-party risk across the financial services sector and EU member states. While DigitalOcean has not yet been designated a critical Information and Communications Technology (ICT) third-party service provider by European Supervisory Authorities, we recognize the need to enable select customers to address their DORA obligations relative to ICT third-party service providers, which can include; but, are not limited to, cloud service providers. Customers who require the DORA Addendum can request the document by contacting Sales. As part of our continued commitment to you, we engaged Schellman Compliance, LLC to facilitate an audit of our environment against DORAâs core regulatory framework, relevant Regulatory Technical Standards (RTS) and Implementation Technical Standards (ITS).

The consistent delivery of high-quality releases underscores the strength of our development cycle and the vibrant support from our community. This release consists of 64 enhancements. Of those enhancements, 18 have graduated to Stable, 20 are entering Beta, 24 have entered Alpha, and 2 are deprecated or withdrawn. There are also several notable deprecations and removals in this release; make sure to read about those if you already run an older version of Kubernetes. The theme for Kubernetes v1.33 is Octarine: The Color of Magic 1 , inspired by Terry Pratchett’s Discworld series. This release highlights the open source magic 2 that Kubernetes enables across the ecosystem. If you’re familiar with the world of Discworld, you might recognize a small swamp dragon perched atop the tower of the Unseen University, gazing up at the Kubernetes moon above the city of Ankh-Morpork with 64 stars 3 in the background. As Kubernetes moves into its second decade, we celebrate both the wizardry of its maintainers, the curiosity of new contributors, and the collaborative spirit that fuels the project. The v1.33 release is a reminder that, as Pratchett wrote, “It’s still magic even if you know how it’s done. ” Even if you know the ins and outs of the Kubernetes code base, stepping back at the end of the release cycle, you’ll realize that Kubernetes remains magical.</description></item><item><title>Kubernetes Multicontainer Pods: An Overview</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-04-22-kubernetes-multicontainer-pods-an-overview/</link><pubDate>Tue, 22 Apr 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-04-22-kubernetes-multicontainer-pods-an-overview/</guid><description>Kubernetes Multicontainer Pods: An Overview The origins of the sidecar pattern Kubernetes implementation When to embrace (or avoid) sidecars Four essential multi-container patterns Init container pattern Ambassador pattern Configuration helper Adapter pattern Wrap-up As cloud-native architectures continue to evolve, Kubernetes has become the go-to platform for deploying complex, distributed systems. One of the most powerful yet nuanced design patterns in this ecosystem is the sidecar pattern—a technique that allows developers to extend application functionality without diving deep into source code. Think of a sidecar like a trusty companion motorcycle attachment. Historically, IT infrastructures have always used auxiliary services to handle critical tasks. Before containers, we relied on background processes and helper daemons to manage logging, monitoring, and networking. The microservices revolution transformed this approach, making sidecars a structured and intentional architectural choice. With the rise of microservices, the sidecar pattern became more clearly defined, allowing developers to offload specific responsibilities from the main service without altering its code. Service meshes like Istio and Linkerd have popularized sidecar proxies, demonstrating how these companion containers can elegantly handle observability, security, and traffic management in distributed systems. In Kubernetes, sidecar containers operate within the same Pod as the main application, enabling communication and resource sharing. Does this sound just like defining multiple containers along each other inside the Pod? It actually does, and this is how sidecar containers had to be implemented before Kubernetes v1.29.0, which introduced native support for sidecars. Sidecar containers can now be defined within a Pod manifest using the spec. initContainers field.</description></item><item><title>Smarter Knowledge Bases for Smarter AI Agents</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-04-16-smarter-knowledge-bases-for-smarter-ai-agents/</link><pubDate>Wed, 16 Apr 2025 22:09:43 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-04-16-smarter-knowledge-bases-for-smarter-ai-agents/</guid><description>Smarter Knowledge Bases for Smarter AI Agents Web crawling for knowledge bases RAG Improvements Bonus: new Anthropic model availableâClaude 3.7 Unlocking more possibilities for AI developers About the author Try DigitalOcean for free Related Articles Announcing OpenAI gpt-oss Models on the DigitalOcean Gradientâ¢ AI Platform Build smarter AI agents: new tools now available for the DigitalOcean Gradientâ¢ AI Platform Introducing GPU Droplets accelerated by NVIDIA HGX H200 By Grace Morgan Published: April 16, 2025 3 min read Weâre rolling out new features to the GenAI Platform that make it easier to build, manage, and improve the knowledge bases behind your AI agents.

Getting started Getting involved Acknowledgments The Kubernetes Scheduler is a crucial control plane component that determines which node a Pod will run on. Thus, anyone utilizing Kubernetes relies on a scheduler. kube-scheduler-simulator is a simulator for the Kubernetes scheduler, that started as a Google Summer of Code 2021 project developed by me (Kensei Nakada) and later received a lot of contributions. This tool allows users to closely examine the scheduler’s behavior and decisions. It is useful for casual users who employ scheduling constraints (for example, inter-Pod affinity ) and experts who extend the scheduler with custom plugins. The scheduler often appears as a black box, composed of many plugins that each contribute to the scheduling decision-making process from their unique perspectives. Understanding its behavior can be challenging due to the multitude of factors it considers. Even if a Pod appears to be scheduled correctly in a simple test cluster, it might have been scheduled based on different calculations than expected. This discrepancy could lead to unexpected scheduling outcomes when deployed in a large production environment. Also, testing a scheduler is a complex challenge. There are countless patterns of operations executed within a real cluster, making it unfeasible to anticipate every scenario with a finite number of tests. More often than not, bugs are discovered only when the scheduler is deployed in an actual cluster.</description></item><item><title>Sharks of DigitalOcean: Makeissah Robinson, Senior Director, Customer Support</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-04-03-sharks-of-digitalocean-makeissah-robinson-senior-director-customer-support/</link><pubDate>Thu, 03 Apr 2025 04:15:54 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-04-03-sharks-of-digitalocean-makeissah-robinson-senior-director-customer-support/</guid><description>Sharks of DigitalOcean: Makeissah Robinson, Senior Director, Customer Support How does your team contribute to DigitalOceanâs mission?

However, as applications grow, so do their infrastructure and scaling requirements. Managing multiple clusters to handle large-scale workloads introduces operational complexity, increased network management, and challenges for the DevOps teams. These challenges can include greater resource fragmentation, increased latency due to inter-cluster communication, and the manual burden of maintaining security and compliance across multiple clusters. These challenges are particularly pronounced for data-intensive workloads like video streaming, large-scale data analytics, and security operations. Thatâs why weâre excited to announce a major evolution of DigitalOcean Kubernetes Service (DOKS), which consists of four features: Increased cluster capacity to 1,000 worker nodes per cluster Increased cluster capacity to 1,000 worker nodes per cluster Optimized networking with VPC-native Kubernetes Optimized networking with VPC-native Kubernetes Improved performance with eBPF-powered networking Improved performance with eBPF-powered networking Managed Cilium for high-performance networking Managed Cilium for high-performance networking These updates help to empower businesses to run larger workloads within a single DOKS cluster, reducing the need for complex multi-cluster management and unlocking new levels of performance, reliability, and simplicity. NoBid, a Kubernetes customer who joined us at Deploy 2025, has seen significant improvements in scalability and security when deploying DOKS. âDigitalOcean Kubernetes provides NoBid with a powerful platform for our containerized workloads,&amp;quot; said Shawn Petersen, CIO at NoBid. âAdditionally, the ability to rapidly scale based on business demand, handle 1.3 PB/month in data egress, along with better security controls were all key differentiators for us to partner with DigitalOcean. &amp;quot; If you want to learn more about NoBidâs use case, check out their case study. Also, you can learn more about their migration from AWS to DigitalOcean and their subsequent 30% cost-savings by watching the testimonial they gave at Deploy 2025.

Get involved As the release of Kubernetes v1.33 approaches, the Kubernetes project continues to evolve. Features may be deprecated, removed, or replaced to improve the overall health of the project. This blog post outlines some planned changes for the v1.33 release, which the release team believes you should be aware of to ensure the continued smooth operation of your Kubernetes environment and to keep you up-to-date with the latest developments. The information below is based on the current status of the v1.33 release and is subject to change before the final release date. The Kubernetes project has a well-documented deprecation policy for features. This policy states that stable APIs may only be deprecated when a newer, stable version of that same API is available and that APIs have a minimum lifetime for each stability level. A deprecated API has been marked for removal in a future Kubernetes release. It will continue to function until removal (at least one year from the deprecation), but usage will result in a warning being displayed. Removed APIs are no longer available in the current version, at which point you must migrate to using the replacement. Generally available (GA) or stable API versions may be marked as deprecated but must not be removed within a major version of Kubernetes. Beta or pre-release API versions must be supported for 3 releases after the deprecation. Alpha or experimental API versions may be removed in any release without prior deprecation notice; this process can become a withdrawal in cases where a different implementation for the same feature is already in place.</description></item><item><title>Kubeflow 1.10 Release Announcement</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-03-26-kubeflow-1-10-release-announcement/</link><pubDate>Wed, 26 Mar 2025 00:00:00 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-03-26-kubeflow-1-10-release-announcement/</guid><description>Highlight features Kubeflow Platform (Manifests &amp;amp; Security) Manifests: Security: Pipelines Support for Placeholders in Resource Limits Support for Loop Parallelism Implement SubDAG Output Resolution Model Registry Model Registry UI Custom Storage Initializer Training Operator (Trainer) &amp;amp; Katib Hyperparameter Optimization API for LLMs Support for Various Parameter Distributions Push-Based Metrics Collection Dashboard &amp;amp; Notebooks Prometheus Metrics for Notebooks More Descriptive Error Messages Spark Operator KServe New Python SDK OCI Storage for Models Model Cache Feature Hugging Face Integration What comes next?

How do I get involved? Swap is a fundamental and an invaluable Linux feature. It offers numerous benefits, such as effectively increasing a node’s memory by swapping out unused data, shielding nodes from system-level memory spikes, preventing Pods from crashing when they hit their memory limits, and much more. As a result, the node special interest group within the Kubernetes project has invested significant effort into supporting swap on Linux nodes. The 1.22 release introduced Alpha support for configuring swap memory usage for Kubernetes workloads running on Linux on a per-node basis. Later, in release 1.28, support for swap on Linux nodes has graduated to Beta, along with many new improvements. In the following Kubernetes releases more improvements were made, paving the way to GA in the near future. Prior to version 1.22, Kubernetes did not provide support for swap memory on Linux systems. This was due to the inherent difficulty in guaranteeing and accounting for pod memory utilization when swap memory was involved. As a result, swap support was deemed out of scope in the initial design of Kubernetes, and the default behavior of a kubelet was to fail to start if swap memory was detected on a node. In version 1.22, the swap feature for Linux was initially introduced in its Alpha stage. This provided Linux users the opportunity to experiment with the swap feature for the first time. However, as an Alpha version, it was not fully developed and only partially worked on limited environments.</description></item><item><title>Ingress-nginx CVE-2025-1974: What You Need to Know</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-03-24-ingress-nginx-cve-2025-1974-what-you-need-to-know/</link><pubDate>Mon, 24 Mar 2025 12:00:00 -0800</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-03-24-ingress-nginx-cve-2025-1974-what-you-need-to-know/</guid><description>Ingress-nginx CVE-2025-1974: What You Need to Know Background Vulnerabilities Patched Today Your next steps Conclusion, thanks, and further reading Today, the ingress-nginx maintainers have released patches for a batch of critical vulnerabilities that could make it easy for attackers to take over your Kubernetes cluster: ingress-nginx v1.12.1 and ingress-nginx v1.11.5. If you are among the over 40% of Kubernetes administrators using ingress-nginx , you should take action immediately to protect your users and data. Ingress is the traditional Kubernetes feature for exposing your workload Pods to the world so that they can be useful. In an implementation-agnostic way, Kubernetes users can define how their applications should be made available on the network. Then, an ingress controller uses that definition to set up local or cloud resources as required for the user’s particular situation and needs. Many different ingress controllers are available, to suit users of different cloud providers or brands of load balancers. Ingress-nginx is a software-only ingress controller provided by the Kubernetes project. Because of its versatility and ease of use, ingress-nginx is quite popular: it is deployed in over 40% of Kubernetes clusters! Ingress-nginx translates the requirements from Ingress objects into configuration for nginx, a powerful open source webserver daemon. Then, nginx uses that configuration to accept and route requests to the various applications running within a Kubernetes cluster. Proper handling of these nginx configuration parameters is crucial, because ingress-nginx needs to allow users significant flexibility while preventing them from accidentally or intentionally tricking nginx into doing things it shouldn’t. Four of today’s ingress-nginx vulnerabilities are improvements to how ingress-nginx handles particular bits of nginx config. Without these fixes, a specially-crafted Ingress object can cause nginx to misbehave in various ways, including revealing the values of Secrets that are accessible to ingress-nginx.</description></item><item><title>Introducing JobSet</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-03-23-introducing-jobset/</link><pubDate>Sun, 23 Mar 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-03-23-introducing-jobset/</guid><description>Introducing JobSet Why JobSet? How JobSet Works Example use case Distributed ML training on multiple TPU slices with Jax Future work and getting involved Authors : Daniel Vega-Myhre (Google), Abdullah Gharaibeh (Google), Kevin Hannon (Red Hat) In this article, we introduce JobSet , an open source API for representing distributed jobs. The goal of JobSet is to provide a unified API for distributed ML training and HPC workloads on Kubernetes. The Kubernetes community’s recent enhancements to the batch ecosystem on Kubernetes has attracted ML engineers who have found it to be a natural fit for the requirements of running distributed training workloads. Large ML models (particularly LLMs) which cannot fit into the memory of the GPU or TPU chips on a single host are often distributed across tens of thousands of accelerator chips, which in turn may span thousands of hosts. As such, the model training code is often containerized and executed simultaneously on all these hosts, performing distributed computations which often shard both the model parameters and/or the training dataset across the target accelerator chips, using communication collective primitives like all-gather and all-reduce to perform distributed computations and synchronize gradients between hosts. These workload characteristics make Kubernetes a great fit for this type of workload, as efficiently scheduling and managing the lifecycle of containerized applications across a cluster of compute resources is an area where it shines. It is also very extensible, allowing developers to define their own Kubernetes APIs, objects, and controllers which manage the behavior and life cycle of these objects, allowing engineers to develop custom distributed training orchestration solutions to fit their needs. However, as distributed ML training techniques continue to evolve, existing Kubernetes primitives do not adequately model them alone anymore. Furthermore, the landscape of Kubernetes distributed training orchestration APIs has become fragmented, and each of the existing solutions in this fragmented landscape has certain limitations that make it non-optimal for distributed ML training. For example, the KubeFlow training operator defines custom APIs for different frameworks (e. g. PyTorchJob, TFJob, MPIJob, etc.</description></item><item><title>Powering AI Innovation: DigitalOcean Bare Metal GPUs in EU Data Center</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-03-20-powering-ai-innovation-digitalocean-bare-metal-gpus-in-eu-data-center/</link><pubDate>Thu, 20 Mar 2025 14:59:45 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-03-20-powering-ai-innovation-digitalocean-bare-metal-gpus-in-eu-data-center/</guid><description>Powering AI Innovation: DigitalOcean Bare Metal GPUs in EU Data Center Lower latency for inferencing in the EU Privacy at the core The benefits of bare metal for AI/ML workloads Powering European AI: DigitalOcean Bare Metal GPUs in EU data center About the author Try DigitalOcean for free Related Articles Announcing OpenAI gpt-oss Models on the DigitalOcean Gradientâ¢ AI Platform Build smarter AI agents: new tools now available for the DigitalOcean Gradientâ¢ AI Platform Introducing GPU Droplets accelerated by NVIDIA HGX H200 By DigitalOcean Published: March 20, 2025 5 min read Bare Metal GPUs are now DigitalOcean GradientAI Bare Metal GPUs.

But as workloads scale, how do you ensure your Spark jobs run efficiently without hitting bottlenecks? Managing thousands of concurrent Spark jobs can introduce severe performance challenges —from CPU saturation in the Spark Operator to Kubernetes API slowdowns and job scheduling inefficiencies. To address these challenges, we are excited to introduce the Kubeflow Spark Operator Benchmarking Results and Toolkit —a comprehensive framework to analyze performance, pinpoint bottlenecks, and optimize your Spark on Kubernetes deployments. This benchmarking effort provides three key outcomes to help you take full control of your Spark on Kubernetes deployment: ✅ Benchmarking Results – A detailed evaluation of performance insights and tuning recommendations for large-scale Spark workloads. 🛠 Benchmarking Test Toolkit – A fully reproducible test suite to help users evaluate their own Spark Operator performance and validate improvements. 📊 Open-Sourced Grafana Dashboard – A battle-tested visualization tool designed specifically to track large-scale Spark Operator deployments, providing real-time monitoring of job processing efficiency, API latencies, and system health. Running thousands of Spark jobs on Kubernetes at scale uncovers several performance roadblocks that can cripple efficiency if left unresolved: 🚦 Spark Operator Becomes CPU-Bound : When handling thousands of Spark jobs, the controller pod maxes out CPU resources, limiting job submission rates. 🐢 High API Server Latency : As workloads scale, Kubernetes API responsiveness degrades—job status updates slow down, affecting observability and scheduling efficiency. 🕒 Webhook Overhead Slows Job Starts : Using webhooks adds ~60 seconds of extra latency per job, reducing throughput in high-concurrency environments. 💥 Namespace Overload Causes Failures : Running 6,000+ SparkApplications in a single namespace resulted in pod failures due to excessive environment variables and service object overload. 💡 So, how do you fix these issues and optimize your Spark Operator deployment? That’s where our benchmarking results and toolkit come in. Based on our benchmarking findings, we provide clear, actionable recommendations for improving Spark Operator performance at scale.</description></item><item><title>DigitalOcean Managed MongoDB now supports MongoDB 8.0</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-03-13-digitalocean-managed-mongodb-now-supports-mongodb-8-0/</link><pubDate>Thu, 13 Mar 2025 17:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-03-13-digitalocean-managed-mongodb-now-supports-mongodb-8-0/</guid><description>DigitalOcean Managed MongoDB now supports MongoDB 8.0 Whatâs new in MongoDB 8.0?

Despite being a managed component, the DOKS routing agent is included at no additional cost for users. The DOKS routing agent enables users to configure IP routes on their Kubernetes worker nodes using a dedicated Kubernetes Custom Resource. This is particularly useful for VPN setups or tunneling egress traffic through specific gateway nodes. apiVersion : networking. doks. digitalocean.</description></item><item><title>Blog: Spotlight on SIG etcd</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-03-04-blog-spotlight-on-sig-etcd/</link><pubDate>Tue, 04 Mar 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-03-04-blog-spotlight-on-sig-etcd/</guid><description>Spotlight on SIG etcd Introducing SIG etcd Becoming a Kubernetes Special Interest Group (SIG) The road ahead Getting involved In this SIG etcd spotlight we talked with James Blair , Marek Siarkowicz , Wenjia Zhang , and Benjamin Wang to learn a bit more about this Kubernetes Special Interest Group.

Part 1: data plane latency Why nftables? Part 2: control plane latency Why not nftables? Trying out nftables mode Future plans Learn more A new nftables mode for kube-proxy was introduced as an alpha feature in Kubernetes 1.29. Currently in beta, it is expected to be GA as of 1.33. The new mode fixes long-standing performance problems with the iptables mode and all users running on systems with reasonably-recent kernels are encouraged to try it out. (For compatibility reasons, even once nftables becomes GA, iptables will still be the default. ) The iptables API was designed for implementing simple firewalls, and has problems scaling up to support Service proxying in a large Kubernetes cluster with tens of thousands of Services. In general, the ruleset generated by kube-proxy in iptables mode has a number of iptables rules proportional to the sum of the number of Services and the total number of endpoints. In particular, at the top level of the ruleset, there is one rule to test each possible Service IP (and port) that a packet might be addressed to: # If the packet is addressed to 172.30.0.41:80, then jump to the chain # KUBE-SVC-XPGD46QRK7WJZT7O for further processing -A KUBE-SERVICES -m comment &amp;ndash;comment &amp;ldquo;namespace1/service1:p80 cluster IP&amp;rdquo; -m tcp -p tcp -d 172.30.0.41 &amp;ndash;dport 80 -j KUBE-SVC-XPGD46QRK7WJZT7O # If the packet is addressed to 172.30.0.42:443, then. -A KUBE-SERVICES -m comment &amp;ndash;comment &amp;ldquo;namespace2/service2:p443 cluster IP&amp;rdquo; -m tcp -p tcp -d 172.30.0.42 &amp;ndash;dport 443 -j KUBE-SVC-GNZBNJ2PO5MGZ6GT # etc. -A KUBE-SERVICES -m comment &amp;ndash;comment &amp;ldquo;namespace3/service3:p80 cluster IP&amp;rdquo; -m tcp -p tcp -d 172.30.0.43 &amp;ndash;dport 80 -j KUBE-SVC-X27LE4BHSL4DOUIK # If the packet is addressed to 172.30.0.41:80, then jump to the chain # KUBE-SVC-XPGD46QRK7WJZT7O for further processing -A KUBE-SERVICES -m comment &amp;ndash;comment &amp;ldquo;namespace1/service1:p80 cluster IP&amp;rdquo; -m tcp -p tcp -d 172.30.0.41 &amp;ndash;dport 80 -j KUBE-SVC-XPGD46QRK7WJZT7O # If the packet is addressed to 172.30.0.42:443, then. -A KUBE-SERVICES -m comment &amp;ndash;comment &amp;ldquo;namespace2/service2:p443 cluster IP&amp;rdquo; -m tcp -p tcp -d 172.30.0.42 &amp;ndash;dport 443 -j KUBE-SVC-GNZBNJ2PO5MGZ6GT # etc. -A KUBE-SERVICES -m comment &amp;ndash;comment &amp;ldquo;namespace3/service3:p80 cluster IP&amp;rdquo; -m tcp -p tcp -d 172.30.0.43 &amp;ndash;dport 80 -j KUBE-SVC-X27LE4BHSL4DOUIK This means that when a packet comes in, the time it takes the kernel to check it against all of the Service rules is O(n) in the number of Services. As the number of Services increases, both the average and the worst-case latency for the first packet of a new connection increases (with the difference between best-case, average, and worst-case being mostly determined by whether a given Service IP address appears earlier or later in the KUBE-SERVICES chain).</description></item><item><title>🔐 Secure Secret Management with SOPS in Terraform &amp; Terragrunt</title><link>https://kubermates.org/blog/secure-secret-management-with-sops-in-terraform-terragrunt-231a/</link><pubDate>Wed, 26 Feb 2025 14:44:59 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/blog/secure-secret-management-with-sops-in-terraform-terragrunt-231a/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;When managing infrastructure as code (IaC), keeping secrets &lt;strong&gt;safe&lt;/strong&gt; while still making them accessible to Terraform/Terragrunt is a challenge.

STEP 1: Setup STEP 2: Implementing RAG pipeline Implementation Details: STEP 3: Run a Katib Experiment STEP 1: Setup STEP 2: Implementing RAG pipeline Implementation Details: Implementation Details: STEP 3: Run a Katib Experiment Define hyperparameter search space Conclusion As artificial intelligence and machine learning models become more sophisticated, optimising their performance remains a critical challenge. Kubeflow provides a robust component, Katib , designed for hyperparameter optimization and neural architecture search. As a part of the Kubeflow ecosystem, Katib enables scalable, automated tuning of underlying machine learning models, reducing the manual effort required for parameter selection while improving model performance across diverse ML workflows. With Retrieval-Augmented Generation ( RAG ) becoming an increasingly popular approach for improving search and retrieval quality, optimizing its parameters is essential to achieving high-quality results. RAG pipelines involve multiple hyperparameters that influence retrieval accuracy, hallucination reduction, and language generation quality. In this blog, we will explore how Katib can be leveraged to fine-tune a RAG pipeline, ensuring optimal performance by systematically adjusting key hyperparameters. Since compute resources are scarcer than a perfectly labeled dataset :), we’ll use a lightweight Kind cluster (Kubernetes in Docker) cluster to run this example locally. Rest assured, this setup can seamlessly scale to larger clusters by increasing the dataset size and the number of hyperparameters to tune. To get started, we’ll first install the Katib control plane in our cluster by following the steps outlined in the documentation. In this implementation, we use a retriever model , which encodes queries and documents into vector representations to find the most relevant matches, to fetch relevant documents based on a query and a generator model to produce coherent text responses. Retriever: Sentence Transformer &amp;amp; FAISS (Facebook AI Similarity Search) Index A SentenceTransformer model (paraphrase-MiniLM-L6-v2) encodes predefined documents into vector representations. FAISS is used to index these document embeddings and perform efficient similarity searches to retrieve the most relevant documents.</description></item><item><title>Synthetic Data Generation with Kubeflow Pipelines</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-02-16-synthetic-data-generation-with-kubeflow-pipelines/</link><pubDate>Sun, 16 Feb 2025 00:00:00 -0600</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-02-16-synthetic-data-generation-with-kubeflow-pipelines/</guid><description>Synthetic Data Generation - Why and How?

But accessing real data often requires lengthy security and legal processes. The data may also be incomplete, biased, or too small, and during early exploration, we may not even know if it’s worth pursuing. While real data is essential for proper evaluation, gaps or limited access frequently hinder progress until the formal process is complete. To address these challenges, synthetic data provides an alternative. It mimics real data’s statistical properties while preserving privacy and accessibility. Synthetic data generators (synthesizers) are models trained on real data to generate new datasets that follow the same statistical distributions and relationships but do not contain real records. This allows for accelerated development, improved data availability, and enhanced privacy. Depending on the technique used, synthetic data not only mirrors statistical base properties of real data but also preserves correlations between features. These synthesizers — such as those based on Gaussian Copulas, Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), and Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) — enable the creation of high-fidelity synthetic datasets. See more description of these techniques below. While the above focuses on speed of development in general, and augmentation of data to improve performance of analytical modes, there are more motivations for creating (synthetic) data: Enhanced Privacy and Security Mimics real datasets without containing sensitive or personally identifiable information, mitigating privacy risks and ensuring compliance with regulations like GDPR.</description></item><item><title>The Cloud Controller Manager Chicken and Egg Problem</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-02-14-the-cloud-controller-manager-chicken-and-egg-problem/</link><pubDate>Fri, 14 Feb 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-02-14-the-cloud-controller-manager-chicken-and-egg-problem/</guid><description>The Cloud Controller Manager Chicken and Egg Problem Examples of the dependency problem Example: Cloud controller manager not scheduling due to uninitialized taint Example: Cloud controller manager not scheduling due to not-ready taint Our Recommendations Example Kubernetes 1.31 completed the largest migration in Kubernetes history , removing the in-tree cloud provider. While the component migration is now done, this leaves some additional complexity for users and installer projects (for example, kOps or Cluster API). We will go over those additional steps and failure points and make recommendations for cluster owners. This migration was complex and some logic had to be extracted from the core components, building four new subsystems. Cloud controller manager ( KEP-2392 ) API server network proxy ( KEP-1281 ) kubelet credential provider plugins ( KEP-2133 ) Storage migration to use CSI ( KEP-625 ) The cloud controller manager is part of the control plane. It is a critical component that replaces some functionality that existed previously in the kube-controller-manager and the kubelet. Components of Kubernetes One of the most critical functionalities of the cloud controller manager is the node controller, which is responsible for the initialization of the nodes. As you can see in the following diagram, when the kubelet starts, it registers the Node object with the apiserver, Tainting the node so it can be processed first by the cloud-controller-manager. The initial Node is missing the cloud-provider specific information, like the Node Addresses and the Labels with the cloud provider specific information like the Node, Region and Instance type information. Chicken and egg problem sequence diagram This new initialization process adds some latency to the node readiness. Previously, the kubelet was able to initialize the node at the same time it created the node. Since the logic has moved to the cloud-controller-manager, this can cause a chicken and egg problem during the cluster bootstrapping for those Kubernetes architectures that do not deploy the controller manager as the other components of the control plane, commonly as static pods, standalone binaries or daemonsets/deployments with tolerations to the taints and using hostNetwork (more on this below) hostNetwork As noted above, it is possible during bootstrapping for the cloud-controller-manager to be unschedulable and as such the cluster will not initialize properly.</description></item><item><title>Blog: Spotlight on SIG Architecture: Enhancements</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-01-21-blog-spotlight-on-sig-architecture-enhancements/</link><pubDate>Tue, 21 Jan 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2025-01-21-blog-spotlight-on-sig-architecture-enhancements/</guid><description>Spotlight on SIG Architecture: Enhancements The Enhancements subproject The KEP and its impact Current areas of focus Getting involved This is the fourth interview of a SIG Architecture Spotlight series that will cover the different subprojects, and we will be covering SIG Architecture: Enhancements.

Kubernetes APIs for volume group snapshots What components are needed to support volume group snapshots What&amp;rsquo;s new in Beta? How do I use Kubernetes volume group snapshots Creating a new group snapshot with Kubernetes How to use group snapshot for restore in Kubernetes As a storage vendor, how do I add support for group snapshots to my CSI driver? What are the limitations? What’s next? How do I get involved? Volume group snapshots were introduced as an Alpha feature with the Kubernetes 1.27 release. The recent release of Kubernetes v1.32 moved that support to beta. The support for volume group snapshots relies on a set of extension APIs for group snapshots. These APIs allow users to take crash consistent snapshots for a set of volumes. Behind the scenes, Kubernetes uses a label selector to group multiple PersistentVolumeClaims for snapshotting. A key aim is to allow you restore that set of snapshots to new volumes and recover your workload based on a crash consistent recovery point. This new feature is only supported for CSI volume drivers. Some storage systems provide the ability to create a crash consistent snapshot of multiple volumes. A group snapshot represents copies made from multiple volumes, that are taken at the same point-in-time. A group snapshot can be used either to rehydrate new volumes (pre-populated with the snapshot data) or to restore existing volumes to a previous state (represented by the snapshots). The Kubernetes volume plugin system already provides a powerful abstraction that automates the provisioning, attaching, mounting, resizing, and snapshotting of block and file storage. Underpinning all these features is the Kubernetes goal of workload portability: Kubernetes aims to create an abstraction layer between distributed applications and underlying clusters so that applications can be agnostic to the specifics of the cluster they run on and application deployment requires no cluster specific knowledge.</description></item><item><title>Enhancing Kubernetes API Server Efficiency with API Streaming</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2024-12-17-enhancing-kubernetes-api-server-efficiency-with-api-streaming/</link><pubDate>Tue, 17 Dec 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2024-12-17-enhancing-kubernetes-api-server-efficiency-with-api-streaming/</guid><description>Enhancing Kubernetes API Server Efficiency with API Streaming Why does kube-apiserver allocate so much memory for list requests? Streaming list requests Enabling API Streaming for your component What&amp;rsquo;s next? The synthetic test Kubernetes 1.33 update Managing Kubernetes clusters efficiently is critical, especially as their size is growing. A significant challenge with large clusters is the memory overhead caused by list requests. In the existing implementation, the kube-apiserver processes list requests by assembling the entire response in-memory before transmitting any data to the client. But what if the response body is substantial, say hundreds of megabytes? Additionally, imagine a scenario where multiple list requests flood in simultaneously, perhaps after a brief network outage. While API Priority and Fairness has proven to reasonably protect kube-apiserver from CPU overload, its impact is visibly smaller for memory protection. This can be explained by the differing nature of resource consumption by a single API request - the CPU usage at any given time is capped by a constant, whereas memory, being uncompressible, can grow proportionally with the number of processed objects and is unbounded. This situation poses a genuine risk, potentially overwhelming and crashing any kube-apiserver within seconds due to out-of-memory (OOM) conditions. To better visualize the issue, let&amp;rsquo;s consider the below graph. The graph shows the memory usage of a kube-apiserver during a synthetic test. (see the synthetic test section for more details). The results clearly show that increasing the number of informers significantly boosts the server&amp;rsquo;s memory consumption. Notably, at approximately 16:40, the server crashed when serving only 16 informers.</description></item><item><title>Kubernetes v1.32 Adds A New CPU Manager Static Policy Option For Strict CPU Reservation</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2024-12-16-kubernetes-v1-32-adds-a-new-cpu-manager-static-policy-option-for-strict-cpu-rese/</link><pubDate>Mon, 16 Dec 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2024-12-16-kubernetes-v1-32-adds-a-new-cpu-manager-static-policy-option-for-strict-cpu-rese/</guid><description>Kubernetes v1.32 Adds A New CPU Manager Static Policy Option For Strict CPU Reservation Understanding the feature Enabling the feature Monitoring the feature Conclusion Further reading Getting involved In Kubernetes v1.32, after years of community discussion, we are excited to introduce a strict-cpu-reservation option for the CPU Manager static policy. This feature is currently in alpha, with the associated policy hidden by default. You can only use the policy if you explicitly enable the alpha behavior in your cluster. strict-cpu-reservation The CPU Manager static policy is used to reduce latency or improve performance. The reservedSystemCPUs defines an explicit CPU set for OS system daemons and kubernetes system daemons. This option is designed for Telco/NFV type use cases where uncontrolled interrupts/timers may impact the workload performance. you can use this option to define the explicit cpuset for the system/kubernetes daemons as well as the interrupts/timers, so the rest CPUs on the system can be used exclusively for workloads, with less impact from uncontrolled interrupts/timers. More details of this parameter can be found on the Explicitly Reserved CPU List page. reservedSystemCPUs If you want to protect your system daemons and interrupt processing, the obvious way is to use the reservedSystemCPUs option. reservedSystemCPUs However, until the Kubernetes v1.32 release, this isolation was only implemented for guaranteed pods that made requests for a whole number of CPUs. At pod admission time, the kubelet only compares the CPU requests against the allocatable CPUs. In Kubernetes, limits can be higher than the requests; the previous implementation allowed burstable and best-effort pods to use up the capacity of reservedSystemCPUs , which could then starve host OS services of CPU - and we know that people saw this in real life deployments.</description></item><item><title>Kubernetes v1.32: Memory Manager Goes GA</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2024-12-13-kubernetes-v1-32-memory-manager-goes-ga/</link><pubDate>Fri, 13 Dec 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2024-12-13-kubernetes-v1-32-memory-manager-goes-ga/</guid><description>Kubernetes v1.32: Memory Manager Goes GA Observability improvements Improving memory manager reliability and consistency Future development Getting involved With Kubernetes 1.32, the memory manager has officially graduated to General Availability (GA), marking a significant milestone in the journey toward efficient and predictable memory allocation for containerized applications. Since Kubernetes v1.22, where it graduated to beta, the memory manager has proved itself reliable, stable and a good complementary feature for the CPU Manager. As part of kubelet&amp;rsquo;s workload admission process, the memory manager provides topology hints to optimize memory allocation and alignment. This enables users to allocate exclusive memory for Pods in the Guaranteed QoS class. More details about the process can be found in the memory manager goes to beta blog. Most of the changes introduced since the Beta are bug fixes, internal refactoring and observability improvements, such as metrics and better logging. As part of the effort to increase the observability of memory manager, new metrics have been added to provide some statistics on memory allocation patterns. memory_manager_pinning_requests_total - tracks the number of times the pod spec required the memory manager to pin memory pages. memory_manager_pinning_errors_total - tracks the number of times the pod spec required the memory manager to pin memory pages, but the allocation failed. The kubelet does not guarantee pod ordering when admitting pods after a restart or reboot. In certain edge cases, this behavior could cause the memory manager to reject some pods, and in more extreme cases, it may cause kubelet to fail upon restart. Previously, the beta implementation lacked certain checks and logic to prevent these issues.</description></item><item><title>Kubernetes v1.32: QueueingHint Brings a New Possibility to Optimize Pod Scheduling</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2024-12-12-kubernetes-v1-32-queueinghint-brings-a-new-possibility-to-optimize-pod-schedulin/</link><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2024-12-12-kubernetes-v1-32-queueinghint-brings-a-new-possibility-to-optimize-pod-schedulin/</guid><description>Kubernetes v1.32: QueueingHint Brings a New Possibility to Optimize Pod Scheduling Scheduling queue Scheduling framework and plugins Improvements to retrying Pod scheduling with QueuingHint QueueingHint&amp;rsquo;s history and what&amp;rsquo;s new in v1.32 Getting involved How can I learn more? The Kubernetes scheduler is the core component that selects the nodes on which new Pods run. The scheduler processes these new Pods one by one. Therefore, the larger your clusters, the more important the throughput of the scheduler becomes. Over the years, Kubernetes SIG Scheduling has improved the throughput of the scheduler in multiple enhancements. This blog post describes a major improvement to the scheduler in Kubernetes v1.32: a scheduling context element named QueueingHint. This page provides background knowledge of the scheduler and explains how QueueingHint improves scheduling throughput. The scheduler stores all unscheduled Pods in an internal component called the scheduling queue. The scheduling queue consists of the following data structures: ActiveQ : holds newly created Pods or Pods that are ready to be retried for scheduling. BackoffQ : holds Pods that are ready to be retried but are waiting for a backoff period to end. The backoff period depends on the number of unsuccessful scheduling attempts performed by the scheduler on that Pod. Unschedulable Pod Pool : holds Pods that the scheduler won&amp;rsquo;t attempt to schedule for one of the following reasons: The scheduler previously attempted and was unable to schedule the Pods. Since that attempt, the cluster hasn&amp;rsquo;t changed in a way that could make those Pods schedulable.</description></item><item><title>Kubernetes v1.32: Penelope</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2024-12-11-kubernetes-v1-32-penelope/</link><pubDate>Wed, 11 Dec 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2024-12-11-kubernetes-v1-32-penelope/</guid><description>Kubernetes v1.32: Penelope Release theme and logo Updates to recent key features A note on DRA enhancements Quality of life improvements on nodes and sidecar containers update Highlights of features graduating to Stable Custom Resource field selectors Support to size memory backed volumes Bound service account token improvement Structured authorization configuration Auto remove PVCs created by StatefulSet Highlights of features graduating to Beta Job API managed-by mechanism Only allow anonymous auth for configured endpoints Per-plugin callback functions for accurate requeueing in kube-scheduler enhancements Recover from volume expansion failure Volume group snapshot Structured parameter support Label and field selector authorization Highlights of new features in Alpha Asynchronous preemption in the Kubernetes Scheduler Mutating admission policies using CEL expressions Pod-level resource specifications Allow zero value for sleep action of PreStop hook DRA: Standardized network interface data for resource claim status New statusz and flagz endpoints for core components Windows strikes back! Graduations, deprecations, and removals in 1.32 Graduations to Stable Deprecations and removals Release notes and upgrade actions required Availability Release team Project velocity Event updates Upcoming release webinar Get involved Editors: Matteo Bianchi, Edith Puclla, William Rizzo, Ryota Sawada, Rashan Smith Announcing the release of Kubernetes v1.32: Penelope! In line with previous releases, the release of Kubernetes v1.32 introduces new stable, beta, and alpha features. The consistent delivery of high-quality releases underscores the strength of our development cycle and the vibrant support from our community. This release consists of 44 enhancements in total. Of those enhancements, 13 have graduated to Stable, 12 are entering Beta, and 19 have entered in Alpha. The Kubernetes v1.32 Release Theme is &amp;ldquo;Penelope&amp;rdquo;. If Kubernetes is Ancient Greek for &amp;ldquo;pilot&amp;rdquo;, in this release we start from that origin and reflect on the last 10 years of Kubernetes and our accomplishments: each release cycle is a journey, and just like Penelope, in &amp;ldquo;The Odyssey&amp;rdquo;, weaved for 10 years &amp;ndash; each night removing parts of what she had done during the day &amp;ndash; so does each release add new features and removes others, albeit here with a much clearer purpose of constantly improving Kubernetes. With v1.32 being the last release in the year Kubernetes marks its first decade anniversary, we wanted to honour all of those that have been part of the global Kubernetes crew that roams the cloud-native seas through perils and challanges: may we continue to weave the future of Kubernetes together. In this release, like the previous one, the Kubernetes project continues proposing a number of enhancements to the Dynamic Resource Allocation (DRA), a key component of the Kubernetes resource management system. These enhancements aim to improve the flexibility and efficiency of resource allocation for workloads that require specialized hardware, such as GPUs, FPGAs and network adapters. These features are particularly useful for use-cases such as machine learning or high-performance computing applications. The core part enabling DRA Structured parameter support got promoted to beta. SIG Node has the following highlights that go beyond KEPs: The systemd watchdog capability is now used to restart the kubelet when its health check fails, while also limiting the maximum number of restarts within a given time period.</description></item><item><title>Gateway API v1.2: WebSockets, Timeouts, Retries, and More</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2024-11-21-gateway-api-v1-2-websockets-timeouts-retries-and-more/</link><pubDate>Thu, 21 Nov 2024 09:00:00 -0800</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2024-11-21-gateway-api-v1-2-websockets-timeouts-retries-and-more/</guid><description>Gateway API v1.2: WebSockets, Timeouts, Retries, and More Breaking changes GRPCRoute and ReferenceGrant v1alpha2 removal Change to. status. supportedFeatures (experimental) Graduations to the standard channel HTTPRoute timeouts Gateway infrastructure labels and annotations Backend protocol support New additions to experimental channel Named rules for *Route resources HTTPRoute retry support HTTPRoute percentage-based mirroring Additional backend TLS configuration More changes Project updates Release process improvements gwctl moves out Maintainer changes Try it out Get involved Related Kubernetes blog articles Kubernetes SIG Network is delighted to announce the general availability of Gateway API v1.2! This version of the API was released on October 3, and we&amp;rsquo;re delighted to report that we now have a number of conformant implementations of it for you to try out. Gateway API v1.2 brings a number of new features to the Standard channel (Gateway API&amp;rsquo;s GA release channel), introduces some new experimental features, and inaugurates our new release process — but it also brings two breaking changes that you&amp;rsquo;ll want to be careful of. v1alpha2 Now that the v1 versions of GRPCRoute and ReferenceGrant have graduated to Standard, the old v1alpha2 versions have been removed from both the Standard and Experimental channels, in order to ease the maintenance burden that perpetually supporting the old versions would place on the Gateway API community. v1 v1alpha2 Before upgrading to Gateway API v1.2, you&amp;rsquo;ll want to confirm that any implementations of Gateway API have been upgraded to support the v1 API version of these resources instead of the v1alpha2 API version. Note that even if you&amp;rsquo;ve been using v1 in your YAML manifests, a controller may still be using v1alpha2 which would cause it to fail during this upgrade. Additionally, Kubernetes itself goes to some effort to stop you from removing a CRD version that it thinks you&amp;rsquo;re using: check out the release notes for more information about what you need to do to safely upgrade. status. supportedFeatures A much smaller breaking change:. status. supportedFeatures in a Gateway is now a list of objects instead of a list of strings.</description></item><item><title>How we built a dynamic Kubernetes API Server for the API Aggregation Layer in Cozystack</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2024-11-21-how-we-built-a-dynamic-kubernetes-api-server-for-the-api-aggregation-layer-in-co/</link><pubDate>Thu, 21 Nov 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2024-11-21-how-we-built-a-dynamic-kubernetes-api-server-for-the-api-aggregation-layer-in-co/</guid><description>How we built a dynamic Kubernetes API Server for the API Aggregation Layer in Cozystack What Is the API Aggregation Layer?

Next Steps Conclusion Hi there! I&amp;rsquo;m Andrei Kvapil, but you might know me as @kvaps in communities dedicated to Kubernetes and cloud-native tools. In this article, I want to share how we implemented our own extension api-server in the open-source PaaS platform, Cozystack. Kubernetes truly amazes me with its powerful extensibility features. You&amp;rsquo;re probably already familiar with the controller concept and frameworks like kubebuilder and operator-sdk that help you implement it. In a nutshell, they allow you to extend your Kubernetes cluster by defining custom resources (CRDs) and writing additional controllers that handle your business logic for reconciling and managing these kinds of resources. This approach is well-documented, with a wealth of information available online on how to develop your own operators. However, this is not the only way to extend the Kubernetes API. For more complex scenarios such as implementing imperative logic, managing subresources, and dynamically generating responses—the Kubernetes API aggregation layer provides an effective alternative. Through the aggregation layer, you can develop a custom extension API server and seamlessly integrate it within the broader Kubernetes API framework. In this article, I will explore the API aggregation layer, the types of challenges it is well-suited to address, cases where it may be less appropriate, and how we utilized this model to implement our own extension API server in Cozystack. First, let&amp;rsquo;s get definitions straight to avoid any confusion down the road. The API aggregation layer is a feature in Kubernetes, while an extension api-server is a specific implementation of an API server for the aggregation layer.</description></item><item><title>Kubernetes v1.32 sneak peek</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2024-11-08-kubernetes-v1-32-sneak-peek/</link><pubDate>Fri, 08 Nov 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2024-11-08-kubernetes-v1-32-sneak-peek/</guid><description>As we get closer to the release date for Kubernetes v1. 32, the project develops and matures. Features may be deprecated, removed, or replaced with better ones for the project&amp;rsquo;s overall health. This blog outlines some of the planned changes for the Kubernetes v1. 32 release, that the release team feels you should be aware of, for the continued maintenance of your Kubernetes environment and keeping up to date with the latest changes. Information listed below is based on the current status of the v1. 32 release and may change before the actual release date. The Kubernetes project has a well-documented deprecation policy for features. This policy states that stable APIs may only be deprecated when a newer, stable version of that API is available and that APIs have a minimum lifetime for each stability level. A deprecated API has been marked for removal in a future Kubernetes release will continue to function until removal (at least one year from the deprecation). Its usage will result in a warning being displayed. Removed APIs are no longer available in the current version, so you must migrate to use the replacement instead.</description></item><item><title>Creating alerts from panels in Kubernetes Monitoring: an overlooked, powerhouse feature</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2024-11-04-creating-alerts-from-panels-in-kubernetes-monitoring-an-overlooked-powerhouse-fe/</link><pubDate>Mon, 04 Nov 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2024-11-04-creating-alerts-from-panels-in-kubernetes-monitoring-an-overlooked-powerhouse-fe/</guid><description>New in Grafana Alerting: a faster, more scalable way to manage your alerts in Grafana Alejandro Fraenkel Â· 5 Aug 2025 Â· 9 min read We built a brand new alert rules list page.

Interview with participants Keita Mochizuki ( NTT DATA Group Corporation ) Yoshiki Fujikane ( CyberAgent, Inc. ) Future of Kubernetes upstream training We are organizers of Kubernetes Upstream Training in Japan. Our team is composed of members who actively contribute to Kubernetes, including individuals who hold roles such as member, reviewer, approver, and chair. Our goal is to increase the number of Kubernetes contributors and foster the growth of the community. While Kubernetes community is friendly and collaborative, newcomers may find the first step of contributing to be a bit challenging. Our training program aims to lower that barrier and create an environment where even beginners can participate smoothly. Our training started in 2019 and is held 1 to 2 times a year. Initially, Kubernetes Upstream Training was conducted as a co-located event of KubeCon (Kubernetes Contributor Summit), but we launched Kubernetes Upstream Training in Japan with the aim of increasing Japanese contributors by hosting a similar event in Japan. Before the pandemic, the training was held in person, but since 2020, it has been conducted online. The training offers the following content for those who have not yet contributed to Kubernetes: Introduction to Kubernetes community Overview of Kubernetes codebase and how to create your first PR Tips and encouragement to lower participation barriers, such as language How to set up the development environment Hands-on session using kubernetes-sigs/contributor-playground At the beginning of the program, we explain why contributing to Kubernetes is important and who can contribute. We emphasize that contributing to Kubernetes allows you to make a global impact and that Kubernetes community is looking forward to your contributions! We also explain Kubernetes community, SIGs, and Working Groups. Next, we explain the roles and responsibilities of Member, Reviewer, Approver, Tech Lead, and Chair.</description></item><item><title>Monitoring Kubernetes: Why traditional techniques aren't enough</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2024-10-18-monitoring-kubernetes-why-traditional-techniques-aren-t-enough/</link><pubDate>Fri, 18 Oct 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2024-10-18-monitoring-kubernetes-why-traditional-techniques-aren-t-enough/</guid><description>Kubernetes Monitoring backend 2.2: better cluster observability through new alert and recording.

In this interview, Sandeep Kanabar , a deaf member of the DHHWG and part of the Kubernetes SIG ContribEx Communications team , sits down with Catherine to explore the impact of the DHHWG on cloud native projects like Kubernetes. Sandeep’s journey is a testament to the power of inclusion. Through his involvement in the DHHWG, he connected with members of the Kubernetes community who encouraged him to join SIG ContribEx - the group responsible for sustaining the Kubernetes contributor experience. In an ecosystem where open-source projects are actively seeking contributors and maintainers, this story highlights how important it is to create pathways for underrepresented groups, including those with disabilities, to contribute their unique perspectives and skills. In this interview, we delve into Catherine’s journey, the challenges and triumphs of establishing the DHHWG, and the vision for a more inclusive future in cloud native. We invite Kubernetes contributors, maintainers, and community members to reflect on the significance of empathy, advocacy, and community in fostering a truly inclusive environment for all, and to think about how they can support efforts to increase diversity and accessibility within their own projects. Sandeep Kanabar (SK): Hello Catherine, could you please introduce yourself, share your professional background, and explain your connection to the Kubernetes ecosystem? Catherine Paganini (CP) : I’m the Head of Marketing at Buoyant , the creator of Linkerd , the CNCF-graduated service mesh, and 5th CNCF project. Four years ago, I started contributing to open source. The initial motivation was to make cloud native concepts more accessible to newbies and non-technical people.

Firstly, I got to know about GSoC and Kubeflow with the recommendation from the former active maintainer Ce Gao(gaocegege)’s personal blog. And I was deeply impressed by the idea of cloud native AI toolkits, I decided to dive into this area and learn some skills to enhance my career and future. In the blog, I’ll provide my personal insight into Katib, for those who are interested in cloud native, AI, and hyperparameters tuning. The project aims to provide a Python SDK API interface for users to push metrics to Katib DB directly. The current implementation of Metrics Collector is pull-based, raising design problems such as determining the frequency at which we scrape the metrics, performance issues like the overhead caused by too many sidecar containers, and restrictions on developing environments that must support sidecar containers and admission webhooks. And also, for data scientists, they need to pay attention to the format of metrics printed in the training scripts, which is error prone and may be hard to recognize. We decided to implement a new API for Katib Python SDK to offer users a push-based way to store metrics directly into the Kaitb DB and resolve those issues raised by pull-based metrics collection. In the new design, users just need to set metrics_collector_config={&amp;ldquo;kind&amp;rdquo;: &amp;ldquo;Push&amp;rdquo;} in the tune() function and call the report_metrics() API in their objective function to push metrics to Katib DB directly. There are no sidecar containers and restricted metric log formats any more. After that, Trial Controller will continuously collect metrics from Katib DB and update the status of Trial, which is the same as pull-based metrics collection. metrics_collector_config={&amp;ldquo;kind&amp;rdquo;: &amp;ldquo;Push&amp;rdquo;} tune() report_metrics() If you are interested in it, please refer to this doc and example for more details.</description></item><item><title>Capsule: How to Use It and First Steps to Set It Up on an AKS Cluster 🚀</title><link>https://kubermates.org/blog/capsule-how-to-use-it-and-first-steps-to-set-it-up-on-an-aks-cluster-5hl5/</link><pubDate>Tue, 24 Sep 2024 19:24:03 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/blog/capsule-how-to-use-it-and-first-steps-to-set-it-up-on-an-aks-cluster-5hl5/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Capsule is an awesome, open-source solution that helps you manage multiple tenants in Kubernetes clusters, making it super easy to handle multi-tenancy.

Can you provide a brief overview of SIG Scheduling and explain its role within the Kubernetes ecosystem? KN : As the name implies, our responsibility is to enhance scheduling within Kubernetes. Specifically, we develop the components that determine which Node is the best place for each Pod. In Kubernetes, our main focus is on maintaining the kube-scheduler , along with other scheduling-related components as part of our SIG subprojects. That makes me curious–what recent innovations or developments has SIG Scheduling introduced to Kubernetes scheduling? KN : From a feature perspective, there have been several enhancements to PodTopologySpread recently. PodTopologySpread is a relatively new feature in the scheduler, and we are still in the process of gathering feedback and making improvements.

My project focused on developing a high-level API for optimizing hyperparameters in Large Language Models (LLMs) within Katib, Kubeflow’s automated hyperparameter tuning system. I’d like to share insights from this experience with others interested in Kubeflow, GSoC, or optimizing LLMs. The rapid advancements and rising popularity of LLMs, such as GPT and BERT, have created a growing demand for efficient LLMOps in Kubernetes. To address this, we have developed a train API within the Training Python SDK, simplifying the process of fine-tuning LLMs using distributed PyTorchJob workers. However, hyperparameter optimization remains a crucial yet labor-intensive task for enhancing model performance. Hyperparameter optimization is essential but time-consuming, especially for LLMs with billions of parameters. This API simplifies the process by handling Kubernetes infrastructure, allowing data scientists to focus on model performance rather than system configuration. With this API, users can import pretrained models and datasets from Hugging Face and Amazon S3, define parameters including the hyperparameter search space, optimization objective, and resource configuration. The API then automates the creation of Experiment, which contains multiple Trials with different hyperparameter settings using PyTorch distributed training. It then collects and analyzes the metrics from each Trial to identify the optimal hyperparameter configuration. For detailed instruction on using the API, please refer to this guide My work on the project can be broadly divided into four stages: Stage 1 : Designing the API, drafting the project proposal, and refining it into a Kubeflow Enhancement Proposal (KEP).</description></item><item><title>Admission Controllers in Kubernetes: OPA GateKeeper, Kyverno, and Azure Policy Add-on for AKS—Which One Wins? 🏆</title><link>https://kubermates.org/blog/admission-controllers-in-kubernetes-opa-gatekeeper-kyverno-and-azure-policy-add-on-for-aks-which-one-wins-237d/</link><pubDate>Tue, 17 Sep 2024 07:25:52 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/blog/admission-controllers-in-kubernetes-opa-gatekeeper-kyverno-and-azure-policy-add-on-for-aks-which-one-wins-237d/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;When managing a Kubernetes cluster, controlling what gets deployed and ensuring resources comply with security, governance, and operational policies is essential.

Getting this right helps keep your application available, resilient, and running smoothly. Two tools that can help you do this are &lt;strong&gt;Pod Topology Spread Constraints&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Node Affinity&lt;/strong&gt;.

&lt;p&gt;Think of &lt;strong&gt;Pod Topology Spread Constraints&lt;/strong&gt; as a way to tell Kubernetes, &amp;ldquo;Hey, I want my Pods spread out evenly across different parts of my cluster.&amp;rdquo; This helps prevent all your Pods from ending up in the same spot, which could be a problem if that spot has an issue.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>How to Test the Latest Kubernetes Changes in Version 1.31 "Elli"</title><link>https://kubermates.org/blog/how-to-test-the-latest-kubernetes-changes-in-version-131-elli-39ec/</link><pubDate>Wed, 14 Aug 2024 21:38:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/blog/how-to-test-the-latest-kubernetes-changes-in-version-131-elli-39ec/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Testing Kubernetes 1.31 &amp;ldquo;Elli&amp;rdquo; involves setting up a dedicated environment, verifying new features, validating API changes, running automated tests, and closely monitoring your cluster. Here’s a detailed guide with examples for each step.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="1-set-up-a-testing-environment"&gt;1. Set Up a Testing Environment&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Create a Kubernetes Cluster&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Example&lt;/strong&gt;: Use Minikube to create a local cluster. Run:
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"&gt;&lt;code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;&lt;span class="cl"&gt;minikube start --kubernetes-version&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;v1.31.0
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;This command sets up a Kubernetes 1.31 cluster locally, allowing you to test the new features and changes in a controlled environment.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cloud-Based Testing&lt;/strong&gt;: For cloud environments, use a tool like &lt;code&gt;eksctl&lt;/code&gt; for Amazon EKS:
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"&gt;&lt;code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;&lt;span class="cl"&gt;eksctl create cluster --version 1.31 --name test-cluster
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;This command creates an Amazon EKS cluster with Kubernetes 1.31, suitable for more extensive testing scenarios.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Isolate the Environment&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Observe deleted Kubernetes components in Grafana Cloud to boost troubleshooting and resource management</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2024-08-08-observe-deleted-kubernetes-components-in-grafana-cloud-to-boost-troubleshooting-/</link><pubDate>Thu, 08 Aug 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2024-08-08-observe-deleted-kubernetes-components-in-grafana-cloud-to-boost-troubleshooting-/</guid><description>Inside Grafana Labsâ Voice of Customer program: whatâs new and whatâs next Elizabeth Burkly Â· 26 Aug 2025 Â· 9 min read With our Voice of Customer program, we can tighten the loop between what our users ask for and what we prioritize in R&amp;amp;D.

Frederico (FSM): Hello, and thank your for your time. To start with, could you tell us about yourselves and how you got involved in Kubernetes? David : I started working on OpenShift (the Red Hat distribution of Kubernetes) in the fall of 2014 and got involved pretty quickly in API Machinery. My first PRs were fixing kube-apiserver error messages and from there I branched out to kubectl ( kubeconfigs are my fault!), auth ( RBAC and *Review APIs are ports from OpenShift), apps ( workqueues and sharedinformers for example). Don’t tell the others, but API Machinery is still my favorite :) kubectl auth *Review apps Federico : I was not as early in Kubernetes as David, but now it’s been more than six years. At my previous company we were starting to use Kubernetes for our own products, and when I came across the opportunity to work directly with Kubernetes I left everything and boarded the ship (no pun intended). I joined Google and Kubernetes in early 2018, and have been involved since. FSM: It only takes a quick look at the SIG API Machinery charter to see that it has quite a significant scope, nothing less than the Kubernetes control plane. Could you describe this scope in your own words? David : We own the kube-apiserver and how to efficiently use it. On the backend, that includes its contract with backend storage and how it allows API schema evolution over time. On the frontend, that includes schema best practices, serialization, client patterns, and controller patterns on top of all of it. kube-apiserver Federico : Kubernetes has a lot of different components, but the control plane has a really critical mission: it’s your communication layer with the cluster and also owns all the extensibility mechanisms that make Kubernetes so powerful.</description></item><item><title>Monitor these Kubernetes signals to help rightsize your fleet</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2024-07-29-monitor-these-kubernetes-signals-to-help-rightsize-your-fleet/</link><pubDate>Mon, 29 Jul 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2024-07-29-monitor-these-kubernetes-signals-to-help-rightsize-your-fleet/</guid><description>Kubernetes Monitoring backend 2.2: better cluster observability through new alert and recording.

This is where conformance testing becomes crucial, verifying that a Kubernetes cluster meets the required standards set by the community. Today, we’re thrilled to introduce Hydrophone , a lightweight runner designed to streamline Kubernetes tests using the official conformance images released by the Kubernetes release team. Hydrophone’s design philosophy centers around ease of use. By starting the conformance image as a pod within the conformance namespace, Hydrophone waits for the tests to conclude, then prints and exports the results. This approach offers a hassle-free method for running either individual tests or the entire Conformance Test Suite. Ease of Use : Designed with simplicity in mind, Hydrophone provides an easy-to-use tool for conducting Kubernetes conformance tests. Official Conformance Images : It leverages the official conformance images from the Kubernetes Release Team, ensuring that you’re using the most up-to-date and reliable resources for testing. Flexible Test Execution : Whether you need to run a single test, the entire Conformance Test Suite, or anything in between. In the Kubernetes world, where providers like EKS, Rancher, and k3s offer diverse environments, ensuring consistent experiences is vital. This consistency is anchored in conformance testing, which validates whether these environments adhere to Kubernetes community standards. Historically, this validation has either been cumbersome or requires third-party tools.</description></item><item><title>How to use the Grafana Operator: Managing a Grafana Cloud stack in Kubernetes</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2024-04-24-how-to-use-the-grafana-operator-managing-a-grafana-cloud-stack-in-kubernetes/</link><pubDate>Wed, 24 Apr 2024 10:22:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2024-04-24-how-to-use-the-grafana-operator-managing-a-grafana-cloud-stack-in-kubernetes/</guid><description>Inside Grafana Labsâ Voice of Customer program: whatâs new and whatâs next Elizabeth Burkly Â· 26 Aug 2025 Â· 9 min read With our Voice of Customer program, we can tighten the loop between what our users ask for and what we prioritize in R&amp;amp;D.

What’s Next? Join the Movement We’re excited to announce the migration of Google’s Spark Operator to the Kubeflow Spark Operator , marking the launch of a significant addition to the Kubeflow ecosystem. The Kubeflow Spark Operator simplifies the deployment and management of Apache Spark applications on Kubernetes. This announcement isn’t just about a new piece of technology, it’s about building a stronger, open-governed, and more collaborative community around Spark on Kubernetes. The journey of the Kubeflow Spark Operator began with Google Cloud Platform’s Spark on Kubernetes Operator (https://cloud. google. com/blog/products/data-analytics/data-analytics-meet-containers-kubernetes-operator-for-apache-spark-now-in-beta). With over 2. 3k stars and 1. 3k forks on GitHub, this project laid the foundation for a robust Spark on Kubernetes experience, enabling users to deploy Spark workloads seamlessly across Kubernetes clusters. Growth and innovation require not just code but also community. Acknowledging the resource and time limitations faced by Google Cloud’s original maintainers, Kubeflow has taken up the mantle. This transition is not merely administrative but a strategic move towards fostering a vibrant, diverse, and more actively engaged community.</description></item><item><title>Blog: Spotlight on SIG Architecture: Code Organization</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2024-04-11-blog-spotlight-on-sig-architecture-code-organization/</link><pubDate>Thu, 11 Apr 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2024-04-11-blog-spotlight-on-sig-architecture-code-organization/</guid><description>Spotlight on SIG Architecture: Code Organization Introducing the Code Organization subproject Code organization and Kubernetes Release cycle and current priorities Wrapping up This is the third interview of a SIG Architecture Spotlight series that will cover the different subprojects. We will cover SIG Architecture: Code Organization. In this SIG Architecture spotlight I talked with Madhav Jivrajani (VMware), a member of the Code Organization subproject. Frederico (FSM) : Hello Madhav, thank you for your availability. Could you start by telling us a bit about yourself, your role and how you got involved in Kubernetes? Madhav Jivrajani (MJ) : Hello! My name is Madhav Jivrajani, I serve as a technical lead for SIG Contributor Experience and a GitHub Admin for the Kubernetes project. Apart from that I also contribute to SIG API Machinery and SIG Etcd, but more recently, I’ve been helping out with the work that is needed to help Kubernetes stay on supported versions of Go , and it is through this that I am involved with the Code Organization subproject of SIG Architecture. FSM : A project the size of Kubernetes must have unique challenges in terms of code organization – is this a fair assumption? If so, what would you pick as some of the main challenges that are specific to Kubernetes? MJ : That’s a fair assumption! The first interesting challenge comes from the sheer size of the Kubernetes codebase. We have ≅2.2 million lines of Go code (which is steadily decreasing thanks to dims and other folks in this sub-project!), and a little over 240 dependencies that we rely on either directly or indirectly, which is why having a sub-project dedicated to helping out with dependency management is crucial: we need to know what dependencies we’re pulling in, what versions these dependencies are at, and tooling to help make sure we are managing these dependencies across different parts of the codebase in a consistent manner. Another interesting challenge with Kubernetes is that we publish a lot of Go modules as part of the Kubernetes release cycles, one example of this is client-go. However, we as a project would also like the benefits of having everything in one repository to get the advantages of using a monorepo, like atomic commits… so, because of this, code organization works with other SIGs (like SIG Release) to automate the process of publishing code from the monorepo to downstream individual repositories which are much easier to consume, and this way you won’t have to import the entire Kubernetes codebase! client-go FSM : For someone just starting contributing to Kubernetes code-wise, what are the main things they should consider in terms of code organization? How would you sum up the key concepts? MJ : I think one of the key things to keep in mind at least as you’re starting off is the concept of staging directories. In the kubernetes/kubernetes repository, you will come across a directory called staging/. The sub-folders in this directory serve as a bunch of pseudo-repositories.</description></item><item><title>Blog: Using Go workspaces in Kubernetes</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2024-03-19-blog-using-go-workspaces-in-kubernetes/</link><pubDate>Tue, 19 Mar 2024 08:30:00 -0800</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2024-03-19-blog-using-go-workspaces-in-kubernetes/</guid><description>Using Go workspaces in Kubernetes GOPATH and Go modules The problems Enter workspaces The work Results Thanks The Go programming language has played a huge role in the success of Kubernetes. As Kubernetes has grown, matured, and pushed the bounds of what “regular” projects do, the Go project team has also grown and evolved the language and tools. In recent releases, Go introduced a feature called “workspaces” which was aimed at making projects like Kubernetes easier to manage. We’ve just completed a major effort to adopt workspaces in Kubernetes, and the results are great. Our codebase is simpler and less error-prone, and we’re no longer off on our own technology island. Kubernetes is one of the most visible open source projects written in Go. The earliest versions of Kubernetes, dating back to 2014, were built with Go 1.3. Today, 10 years later, Go is up to version 1.22 — and let’s just say that a whole lot has changed. In 2014, Go development was entirely based on GOPATH. As a Go project, Kubernetes lived by the rules of GOPATH. In the buildup to Kubernetes 1.4 (mid 2016), we introduced a directory tree called staging. This allowed us to pretend to be multiple projects, but still exist within one git repository (which had advantages for development velocity).</description></item><item><title>Grafana Labs at KubeCon: eBPF, sustainability, Prometheus, and more</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2024-03-15-grafana-labs-at-kubecon-ebpf-sustainability-prometheus-and-more/</link><pubDate>Fri, 15 Mar 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2024-03-15-grafana-labs-at-kubecon-ebpf-sustainability-prometheus-and-more/</guid><description>How to monitor your homelab with Beyla, eBPF, and OpenTelemetry Colin Steele Â· 22 Aug 2025 Â· 5 min read Learn how Beyla, eBPF, and OpenTelemetry combine to make homelab observability easy with this recap of a recent GrafanaCON 2025 session.</description></item><item><title>Blog: Spotlight on SIG Cloud Provider</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2024-03-01-blog-spotlight-on-sig-cloud-provider/</link><pubDate>Fri, 01 Mar 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2024-03-01-blog-spotlight-on-sig-cloud-provider/</guid><description>Spotlight on SIG Cloud Provider Introduction Functioning and working Important subprojects Accomplishments Advice for new contributors One of the most popular ways developers use Kubernetes-related services is via cloud providers, but have you ever wondered how cloud providers can do that? How does this whole process of integration of Kubernetes to various cloud providers happen? To answer that, let’s put the spotlight on SIG Cloud Provider. SIG Cloud Provider works to create seamless integrations between Kubernetes and various cloud providers. Their mission? Keeping the Kubernetes ecosystem fair and open for all. By setting clear standards and requirements, they ensure every cloud provider plays nicely with Kubernetes. It is their responsibility to configure cluster components to enable cloud provider integrations. In this blog of the SIG Spotlight series, Arujjwal Negi interviews Michael McCune (Red Hat), also known as elmiko , co-chair of SIG Cloud Provider, to give us an insight into the workings of this group. Arujjwal : Let’s start by getting to know you. Can you give us a small intro about yourself and how you got into Kubernetes? Michael : Hi, I’m Michael McCune, most people around the community call me by my handle, elmiko. I’ve been a software developer for a long time now (Windows 3.1 was popular when I started!), and I’ve been involved with open-source software for most of my career. I first got involved with Kubernetes as a developer of machine learning and data science applications; the team I was on at the time was creating tutorials and examples to demonstrate the use of technologies like Apache Spark on Kubernetes. That said, I’ve been interested in distributed systems for many years and when an opportunity arose to join a team working directly on Kubernetes, I jumped at it! Arujjwal : Can you give us an insight into what SIG Cloud Provider does and how it functions? Michael : SIG Cloud Provider was formed to help ensure that Kubernetes provides a neutral integration point for all infrastructure providers. Our largest task to date has been the extraction and migration of in-tree cloud controllers to out-of-tree components.</description></item><item><title>Blog: A look into the Kubernetes Book Club</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2024-02-22-blog-a-look-into-the-kubernetes-book-club/</link><pubDate>Thu, 22 Feb 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2024-02-22-blog-a-look-into-the-kubernetes-book-club/</guid><description>A look into the Kubernetes Book Club Creating the Book Club Topics covered in the Book Club Joining the Book Club Learning Kubernetes and the entire ecosystem of technologies around it is not without its challenges. In this interview, we will talk with Carlos Santana (AWS) to learn a bit more about how he created the Kubernetes Book Club , how it works, and how anyone can join in to take advantage of a community-based learning experience. Frederico Muñoz (FSM) : Hello Carlos, thank you so much for your availability. To start with, could you tell us a bit about yourself? Carlos Santana (CS) : Of course. My experience in deploying Kubernetes in production six years ago opened the door for me to join Knative and then contribute to Kubernetes through the Release Team. Working on upstream Kubernetes has been one of the best experiences I’ve had in open-source. Over the past two years, in my role as a Senior Specialist Solutions Architect at AWS, I have been assisting large enterprises build their internal developer platforms (IDP) on top of Kubernetes. Going forward, my open source contributions are directed towards CNOE and CNCF projects like Argo , Crossplane , and Backstage. FSM : So your path led you to Kubernetes, and at that point what was the motivating factor for starting the Book Club? CS : The idea for the Kubernetes Book Club sprang from a casual suggestion during a TGIK livestream. For me, it was more than just about reading a book; it was about creating a learning community. This platform has not only been a source of knowledge but also a support system, especially during the challenging times of the pandemic. It’s gratifying to see how this initiative has helped members cope and grow.</description></item><item><title>Kubernetes alerting: Simplify anomaly detection in Kubernetes clusters with Grafana Cloud</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2024-02-15-kubernetes-alerting-simplify-anomaly-detection-in-kubernetes-clusters-with-grafa/</link><pubDate>Thu, 15 Feb 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2024-02-15-kubernetes-alerting-simplify-anomaly-detection-in-kubernetes-clusters-with-grafa/</guid><description>New in Grafana Alerting: a faster, more scalable way to manage your alerts in Grafana Alejandro Fraenkel Â· 5 Aug 2025 Â· 9 min read We built a brand new alert rules list page.

Have you ever considered how such a big project like Kubernetes manages its timeline so efficiently to release its new version, or how the internal workings of the Release Team look like? If you’re curious about these questions or want to know more and get involved with the work SIG Release does, read on! SIG Release plays a crucial role in the development and evolution of Kubernetes. Its primary responsibility is to manage the release process of new versions of Kubernetes. It operates on a regular release cycle, typically every three to four months. During this cycle, the Kubernetes Release Team works closely with other SIGs and contributors to ensure a smooth and well-coordinated release. This includes planning the release schedule, setting deadlines for code freeze and testing phases, as well as creating release artefacts like binaries, documentation, and release notes. Before you read further, it is important to note that there are two subprojects under SIG Release - Release Engineering and Release Team. In this blog post, Nitish Kumar interviews Verónica López (PlanetScale), Technical Lead of SIG Release, with the spotlight on the Release Team subproject, how the release process looks like, and ways to get involved. What is the typical release process for a new version of Kubernetes, from initial planning to the final release? Are there any specific methodologies and tools that you use to ensure a smooth release? The release process for a new Kubernetes version is a well-structured and community-driven effort. There are no specific methodologies or tools as such that we follow, except a calendar with a series of steps to keep things organised.

This project started as a fun experiment using emerging technologies and is intended to become a utility for CI and testing to help facilitate the continued development of Gateway API. Are you interested in developing networking tools in Rust and eBPF ? Or perhaps you’re specifically interested in Gateway API? We’ll tell you a bit about the project and how it might benefit you. Blixt originated at Kong as an experiment to test load-balancing ingress traffic for Kubernetes clusters using eBPF for the dataplane. Around the time of Kubecon Detroit (2022) we (the Gateway API maintainers) realized it had significant potential to help us move our TCPRoute and UDPRoute support forward, which had been sort of “stuck in alpha” at the time due to a lack of conformance tests being developed for them. At the same time, various others in the SIG Network community developed an interest in the project due to the rapid growth of eBPFs use on Kubernetes. Given the potential for benefit to the Kubernetes ecosystem and the growing interest, Kong decided it would be helpful to donate the project to Kubernetes SIGs to benefit upstream Kubernetes. Over several months we rewrote the project in Rust (from C), due to a strong contingency of Rust knowledge (and interest) between us developing the project and an active interest in the burgeoning Aya project (a Rust framework for developing eBPF programs). We did eventually move the control plane (specifically) to Golang however, so that we could take advantage of the Kubebuilder and controller-runtime ecosystems. Additionally, we augmented our custom program loader (in eBPF, you generally write loaders that load your BPF byte code into the kernel) with bpfman : a project adjacent to us in the Rust + eBPF ecosystem, which helps solve several security and ergonomic problems with managing BPF programs on Linux systems. After the recently completed license review process , which provided a blanket exception for the use of dual licensed eBPF in CNCF code, the project became officially part of Kubernetes and interest has been growing. We have several goals for the project which revolve around the continued development of Gateway API, with a specific focus on helping mature Layer 4 support (e.</description></item><item><title>Blog: Kubernetes supports running kube-proxy in an unprivileged container</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2024-01-05-blog-kubernetes-supports-running-kube-proxy-in-an-unprivileged-container/</link><pubDate>Fri, 05 Jan 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2024-01-05-blog-kubernetes-supports-running-kube-proxy-in-an-unprivileged-container/</guid><description>Kubernetes supports running kube-proxy in an unprivileged container Background Initializing kube-proxy in an init container Summary This post describes how the &amp;ndash;init-only flag to kube-proxy can be used to run the main kube-proxy container in a stricter securityContext , by performing the configuration that requires privileged mode in a separate init container.

How to use it Performance impact Impact on downstream users Further reading Get involved On behalf of the Structured Logging Working Group and SIG Instrumentation , we are pleased to announce that the contextual logging feature introduced in Kubernetes v1.24 has now been successfully migrated to two components (kube-scheduler and kube-controller-manager) as well as some directories. This feature aims to provide more useful logs for better troubleshooting of Kubernetes and to empower developers to enhance Kubernetes. Contextual logging is based on the go-logr API. The key idea is that libraries are passed a logger instance by their caller and use that for logging instead of accessing a global logger. The binary decides the logging implementation, not the libraries. The go-logr API is designed around structured logging and supports attaching additional information to a logger. This enables additional use cases: The caller can attach additional information to a logger: WithName adds a “logger” key with the names concatenated by a dot as value WithValues adds key/value pairs When passing this extended logger into a function, and the function uses it instead of the global logger, the additional information is then included in all log entries, without having to modify the code that generates the log entries. This is useful in highly parallel applications where it can become hard to identify all log entries for a certain operation, because the output from different operations gets interleaved.

In this edition, we turn our attention to SIG Testing , a group interested in effective testing of Kubernetes and automating away project toil. SIG Testing focus on creating and running tools and infrastructure that make it easier for the community to write and run tests, and to contribute, analyze and act upon test results. To gain some insights into SIG Testing, Sandipan Panda spoke with Michelle Shepardson , a senior software engineer at Google and a chair of SIG Testing, and Patrick Ohly , a software engineer and architect at Intel and a SIG Testing Tech Lead. Sandipan: Could you tell us a bit about yourself, your role, and how you got involved in the Kubernetes project and SIG Testing? Michelle: Hi! I’m Michelle, a senior software engineer at Google. I first got involved in Kubernetes through working on tooling for SIG Testing, like the external instance of TestGrid. I’m part of oncall for TestGrid and Prow, and am now a chair for the SIG. Patrick: Hello! I work as a software engineer and architect in a team at Intel which focuses on open source Cloud Native projects. When I ramped up on Kubernetes to develop a storage driver, my very first question was “how do I test it in a cluster and how do I log information?” That interest led to various enhancement proposals until I had (re)written enough code that also took over official roles as SIG Testing Tech Lead (for the E2E framework ) and structured logging WG lead. Sandipan: Testing is a field in which multiple approaches and tools exist; how did you arrive at the existing practices? Patrick: I can’t speak about the early days because I wasn’t around yet 😆, but looking back at some of the commit history it’s pretty obvious that developers just took what was available and started using it. For E2E testing, that was Ginkgo+Gomega. Some hacks were necessary, for example around cleanup after a test run and for categorising tests.</description></item><item><title>Blog: Kubernetes Contributor Summit: Behind-the-scenes</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2023-11-03-blog-kubernetes-contributor-summit-behind-the-scenes/</link><pubDate>Fri, 03 Nov 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2023-11-03-blog-kubernetes-contributor-summit-behind-the-scenes/</guid><description>Kubernetes Contributor Summit: Behind-the-scenes The Contributor Summit What makes it special Organizing the Summit A look ahead Every year, just before the official start of KubeCon+CloudNativeCon, there’s a special event that has a very special place in the hearts of those organizing and participating in it: the Kubernetes Contributor Summit. To find out why, and to provide a behind-the-scenes perspective, we interview Noah Abrahams, whom amongst other roles was the co-lead for the Kubernetes Contributor Summit in 2023. Frederico Muñoz (FSM) : Hello Noah, and welcome. Could you start by introducing yourself and telling us how you got involved in Kubernetes? Noah Abrahams (NA) : I’ve been in this space for quite a while. I got started in IT in the mid 90’s, and I’ve been working in the “Cloud” space for about 15 years. It was, frankly, through a combination of sheer luck (being in the right place at the right time) and having good mentors to pull me into those places (thanks, Tim!), that I ended up at a startup called Apprenda in 2016. While I was there, they pivoted into Kubernetes, and it was the best thing that could have happened to my career. It was around v1.2 and someone asked me if I could give a presentation on Kubernetes concepts at “my local meetup” in Las Vegas. The meetup didn’t exist yet, so I created it, and got involved in the wider community. One thing led to another, and soon I was involved in ContribEx, joined the release team, was doing booth duty for the CNCF, became an ambassador, and here we are today. FM : Before leading the organisation of the KCSEU 2023, how many other Contributor Summits were you a part of? NA : I was involved in four or five before taking the lead. If I’m recalling correctly, I attended the summit in Copenhagen, then sometime in 2018 I joined the wrong meeting, because the summit staff meeting was listed on the ContribEx calendar.</description></item><item><title>Blog: Spotlight on SIG Architecture: Production Readiness</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2023-11-02-blog-spotlight-on-sig-architecture-production-readiness/</link><pubDate>Thu, 02 Nov 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2023-11-02-blog-spotlight-on-sig-architecture-production-readiness/</guid><description>Spotlight on SIG Architecture: Production Readiness About SIG Architecture and the Production Readiness subproject Production readiness and the Kubernetes project Helping with Production Readiness This is the second interview of a SIG Architecture Spotlight series that will cover the different subprojects. In this blog, we will cover the SIG Architecture: Production Readiness subproject. In this SIG Architecture spotlight, we talked with Wojciech Tyczynski (Google), lead of the Production Readiness subproject. Frederico (FSM) : Hello Wojciech, could you tell us a bit about yourself, your role and how you got involved in Kubernetes? Wojciech Tyczynski (WT) : I started contributing to Kubernetes in January 2015. At that time, Google (where I was and still am working) decided to start a Kubernetes team in the Warsaw office (in addition to already existing teams in California and Seattle). I was lucky enough to be one of the seeding engineers for that team. After two months of onboarding and helping with different tasks across the project towards 1.0 launch, I took ownership of the scalability area and I was leading Kubernetes to support clusters with 5000 nodes. I’m still involved in SIG Scalability as its Technical Lead. That was the start of a journey since scalability is such a cross-cutting topic, and I started contributing to many other areas including, over time, to SIG Architecture. FSM : In SIG Architecture, why specifically the Production Readiness subproject? Was it something you had in mind from the start, or was it an unexpected consequence of your initial involvement in scalability? WT : After reaching that milestone of Kubernetes supporting 5000-node clusters , one of the goals was to ensure that Kubernetes would not degrade its scalability properties over time. While non-scalable implementation is always fixable, designing non-scalable APIs or contracts is problematic. I was looking for a way to ensure that people are thinking about scalability when they create new features and capabilities without introducing too much overhead.</description></item><item><title>Blog: A Quick Recap of 2023 China Kubernetes Contributor Summit</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2023-10-20-blog-a-quick-recap-of-2023-china-kubernetes-contributor-summit/</link><pubDate>Fri, 20 Oct 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2023-10-20-blog-a-quick-recap-of-2023-china-kubernetes-contributor-summit/</guid><description>A Quick Recap of 2023 China Kubernetes Contributor Summit A joyful meetup Technical sharing and discussions China’s contributor statistics Acknowledgments On September 26, 2023, the first day of KubeCon + CloudNativeCon + Open Source Summit China 2023 , nearly 50 contributors gathered in Shanghai for the Kubernetes Contributor Summit. All participants in the 2023 Kubernetes Contributor Summit This marked the first in-person offline gathering held in China after three years of the pandemic. The event began with welcome speeches from Kevin Wang from Huawei Cloud, one of the co-chairs of KubeCon, and Puja from Giant Swarm. Following the opening remarks, the contributors introduced themselves briefly. Most attendees were from China, while some contributors had made the journey from Europe and the United States specifically for the conference. Technical experts from companies such as Microsoft, Intel, Huawei, as well as emerging forces like DaoCloud, were present. Laughter and cheerful voices filled the room, regardless of whether English was spoken with European or American accents or if conversations were carried out in authentic Chinese language. This created an atmosphere of comfort, joy, respect, and anticipation. Past contributions brought everyone closer, and mutual recognition and accomplishments made this offline gathering possible. Face to face meeting in Shanghai The attending contributors were no longer just GitHub IDs; they transformed into vivid faces. From sitting together and capturing group photos to attempting to identify “Who is who,” a loosely connected collective emerged. This team structure, although loosely knit and free-spirited, was established to pursue shared dreams.</description></item><item><title>Blog: Spotlight on SIG Architecture: Conformance</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2023-10-05-blog-spotlight-on-sig-architecture-conformance/</link><pubDate>Thu, 05 Oct 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2023-10-05-blog-spotlight-on-sig-architecture-conformance/</guid><description>Spotlight on SIG Architecture: Conformance About SIG Architecture and the Conformance subproject More on the Conformance Test Suite This is the first interview of a SIG Architecture Spotlight series that will cover the different subprojects.

When I joined ii the plan was to move to New Zealand in April 2020 and then Covid happened. Fortunately, being a flexible and dynamic team we were able to make it work remotely and in very different time zones. The ii. nz team have been tasked with managing the Kubernetes Conformance testing technical debt and writing tests to clear the technical debt. I stepped into the role of project manager to be the link between monitoring, test writing and the community. Through that work I had the privilege of meeting the late Dan Kohn in those first months, his enthusiasm about the work we were doing was a great inspiration.

Sub-projects under SIG ContribEx Accomplishments Upcoming initiatives Final thoughts What next? Author : Fyka Ansari Welcome to the world of Kubernetes and its vibrant contributor community! In this blog post, we’ll be shining a spotlight on the Special Interest Group for Contributor Experience (SIG ContribEx), an essential component of the Kubernetes project. SIG ContribEx in Kubernetes is responsible for developing and maintaining a healthy and productive community of contributors to the project. This involves identifying and addressing bottlenecks that may hinder the project’s growth and feature velocity, such as pull request latency and the number of open pull requests and issues. SIG ContribEx works to improve the overall contributor experience by creating and maintaining guidelines, tools, and processes that facilitate collaboration and communication among contributors. They also focus on community building and support, including outreach programs and mentorship initiatives to onboard and retain new contributors. Ultimately, the role of SIG ContribEx is to foster a welcoming and inclusive environment that encourages contribution and supports the long-term sustainability of the Kubernetes project. In this blog post, Fyka Ansari interviews Kaslin Fields , a DevRel Engineer at Google, who is a chair of SIG ContribEx, and Madhav Jivrajani , a Software Engineer at VMWare who serves as a SIG ContribEx Tech Lead. This interview covers various aspects of SIG ContribEx, including current initiatives, exciting developments, and how interested individuals can get involved and contribute to the group. It provides valuable insights into the workings of SIG ContribEx and highlights the importance of its role in the Kubernetes ecosystem. Fyka: Let’s start by diving into your background and how you got involved in the Kubernetes ecosystem. Can you tell us more about that journey? Kaslin: I first got involved in the Kubernetes ecosystem through my mentor, Jonathan Rippy, who introduced me to containers during my early days in tech. Eventually, I transitioned to a team working with containers, which sparked my interest in Kubernetes when it was announced.</description></item><item><title>Blog: Spotlight on SIG CLI</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2023-07-20-blog-spotlight-on-sig-cli/</link><pubDate>Thu, 20 Jul 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2023-07-20-blog-spotlight-on-sig-cli/</guid><description>Spotlight on SIG CLI Introductions About SIG CLI Current projects and challenges Future plans and contribution In the world of Kubernetes, managing containerized applications at scale requires powerful and efficient tools. The command-line interface (CLI) is an integral part of any developer or operator’s toolkit, offering a convenient and flexible way to interact with a Kubernetes cluster. SIG CLI plays a crucial role in improving the Kubernetes CLI experience by focusing on the development and enhancement of kubectl , the primary command-line tool for Kubernetes. kubectl In this SIG CLI Spotlight, Arpit Agrawal, SIG ContribEx-Comms team member, talked with Katrina Verey , Tech Lead &amp;amp; Chair of SIG CLI,and Maciej Szulik , SIG CLI Batch Lead, about SIG CLI, current projects, challenges and how anyone can get involved. So, whether you are a seasoned Kubernetes enthusiast or just getting started, understanding the significance of SIG CLI will undoubtedly enhance your Kubernetes journey. Arpit : Could you tell us a bit about yourself, your role, and how you got involved in SIG CLI? Maciej : I’m one of the technical leads for SIG-CLI. I was working on Kubernetes in multiple areas since 2014, and in 2018 I got appointed a lead. Katrina : I’ve been working with Kubernetes as an end-user since 2016, but it was only in late 2019 that I discovered how well SIG CLI aligned with my experience from internal projects. I started regularly attending meetings and made a few small PRs, and by 2021 I was working more deeply with the Kustomize team specifically. Later that year, I was appointed to my current roles as subproject owner for Kustomize and KRM Functions, and as SIG CLI Tech Lead and Chair. Arpit : Thank you! Could you share with us the purpose and goals of SIG CLI? Maciej : Our charter has the most detailed description, but in few words, we handle all CLI tooling that helps you manage your Kubernetes manifests and interact with your Kubernetes clusters. And how does SIG CLI work to promote best-practices for CLI development and usage in the cloud native ecosystem? Maciej : Within kubectl , we have several on-going efforts that try to encourage new contributors to align existing commands to new standards.</description></item><item><title>Blog: Spotlight on SIG Network</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2023-05-09-blog-spotlight-on-sig-network/</link><pubDate>Tue, 09 May 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2023-05-09-blog-spotlight-on-sig-network/</guid><description>Spotlight on SIG Network Networking is one of the core pillars of Kubernetes, and the Special Interest Group for Networking (SIG Network) is responsible for developing and maintaining the networking features of Kubernetes. It covers all aspects to ensure Kubernetes provides a reliable and scalable network infrastructure for containerized applications. In this SIG Network spotlight, Sujay Dey talked with Shane Utt , Software Engineer at Kong, chair of SIG Network and maintainer of Gateway API, on different aspects of the SIG, what are the exciting things going on and how anyone can get involved and contribute here. Sujay : Hello, and first of all, thanks for the opportunity of learning more about SIG Network. I would love to hear your story, so could you please tell us a bit about yourself, your role, and how you got involved in Kubernetes, especially in SIG Network? Shane : Hello! Thank you for reaching out. My Kubernetes journey started while I was working for a small data centre: we were early adopters of Kubernetes and focused on using Kubernetes to provide SaaS products. That experience led to my next position developing a distribution of Kubernetes with a focus on networking. During this period in my career, I was active in SIG Network (predominantly as a consumer). When I joined Kong my role in the community changed significantly, as Kong actively encourages upstream participation. I greatly increased my engagement and contributions to the Gateway API project during those years, and eventually became a maintainer. I care deeply about this community and the future of our technology, so when a chair position for the SIG became available, I volunteered my time immediately. I’ve enjoyed working on Kubernetes over the better part of a decade and I want to continue to do my part to ensure our community and technology continues to flourish.</description></item><item><title>Blog: E2E Testing Best Practices, Reloaded</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2023-04-12-blog-e2e-testing-best-practices-reloaded/</link><pubDate>Wed, 12 Apr 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2023-04-12-blog-e2e-testing-best-practices-reloaded/</guid><description>E2E Testing Best Practices, Reloaded Overall architecture Debuggability Recovering from test failures Interrupting tests Polling and timeouts Tips for writing and debugging long-running tests Next steps End-to-end (E2E) testing in Kubernetes is how the project validates functionality with real clusters. Contributors sooner or later encounter it when asked to write E2E tests for new features or to help with debugging test failures. Cluster admins or vendors might run the conformance tests, a subset of all tests in the E2E test suite. The underlying E2E framework for writing these E2E tests has been around for a long time. Functionality was added to it as needed, leading to code that became hard to maintain and use. The testing commons WG started cleaning it up, but dissolved before completely achieving their goals. After the migration to Gingko v2 in Kubernetes 1.25, I picked up several of the loose ends and started untangling them. This blog post is a summary of those changes. Some of this content is also found in the Kubernetes contributor document about writing good E2E tests and gets reproduced here to raise awareness that the document has been updated. At the moment, the framework is used in-tree for testing against a cluster ( test/e2e ), testing kubeadm ( test/e2e_kubeadm ) and kubelet ( test/e2e_node ). The goal is to make the core test/e2e/framework a package that has no dependencies on internal code and that can be used in different E2E suites without polluting them with features or options that make no sense for them. This is currently only a technical goal.</description></item><item><title>Blog: From Zero to Kubernets Subproject Lead</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2023-03-29-blog-from-zero-to-kubernets-subproject-lead/</link><pubDate>Wed, 29 Mar 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2023-03-29-blog-from-zero-to-kubernets-subproject-lead/</guid><description>From Zero to Kubernets Subproject Lead Starting up Always learning Why you - a beginner - are important to the project Getting started in any open-source community can be daunting, especially if it’s a big one like Kubernetes. I wrote this post to share my experience and encourage others to join up. All it takes is some curiosity and a willingness to show up! Here’s how my journey unfolded at a high level: What am I interested in? Is there a SIG (Special Interest Group) or a WG (Working Group) that is dedicated to that topic, or something similar? Sign up for their mailing list and start hopping on meetings. When (never if!) there are opportunities to help out and it aligns with your skills and desired growth areas, raise your hand. Ask for lots of help and don’t be shy about not knowing everything (or anything!) Keep plugging along, even if progress isn’t as fast as you would like it to be. First things first. What are you interested in learning more about? There are so many wonderful SIGs and working groups in the Kubernetes community: there’s something for everyone. And continuing to show up and participate will be so much easier if you think what you are doing is interesting. Likewise, continued participation is what keeps the community thriving, so that interest will drive you to have more of an impact. Also: it’s ok to show up knowing nothing! I remember showing up knowing very little about Kubernetes or how the community itself worked. And while I know more about how the community functions today, I am still learning all the time about it and the project. Fortunately, the community is full of friendly people who want to help you learn.</description></item><item><title>Blog: Introducing KWOK: Kubernetes WithOut Kubelet</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2023-03-01-blog-introducing-kwok-kubernetes-without-kubelet/</link><pubDate>Wed, 01 Mar 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2023-03-01-blog-introducing-kwok-kubernetes-without-kubelet/</guid><description>Introducing KWOK: Kubernetes WithOut Kubelet What is KWOK? Why use KWOK? What are the use cases? What are the limitations? Getting started Getting Involved Author: Shiming Zhang (DaoCloud), Wei Huang (Apple), Yibo Zhuang (Apple) Have you ever wondered how to set up a cluster of thousands of nodes just in seconds, how to simulate real nodes with a low resource footprint, and how to test your Kubernetes controller at scale without spending much on infrastructure? If you answered “yes” to any of these questions, then you might be interested in KWOK, a toolkit that enables you to create a cluster of thousands of nodes in seconds. KWOK stands for Kubernetes WithOut Kubelet. So far, it provides two tools: kwok kwok kwokctl kwokctl kwok KWOK has several advantages: Speed : You can create and delete clusters and nodes almost instantly, without waiting for boot or provisioning. Compatibility : KWOK works with any tools or clients that are compliant with Kubernetes APIs, such as kubectl, helm, kui, etc. Portability : KWOK has no specific hardware or software requirements. You can run it using pre-built images, once Docker or Nerdctl is installed. Alternatively, binaries are also available for all platforms and can be easily installed.

SIG Instrumentation helps to address this issue by providing best practices and tools that all other SIGs use to instrument Kubernetes components-like the API server , scheduler , kubelet and kube-controller-manager. In this SIG Instrumentation spotlight, Imran Noor Mohamed , SIG ContribEx-Comms tech lead talked with Elana Hashman , and Han Kang , chairs of SIG Instrumentation, on how the SIG is organized, what are the current challenges and how anyone can get involved and contribute. Imran (INM) : Hello, thank you for the opportunity of learning more about SIG Instrumentation. Could you tell us a bit about yourself, your role, and how you got involved in SIG Instrumentation? Han (HK) : I started in SIG Instrumentation in 2018, and became a chair in 2020. I primarily got involved with SIG instrumentation due to a number of upstream issues with metrics which ended up affecting GKE in bad ways. As a result, we ended up launching an initiative to stabilize our metrics and make metrics a proper API. Elana (EH) : I also joined SIG Instrumentation in 2018 and became a chair at the same time as Han. I was working as a site reliability engineer (SRE) on bare metal Kubernetes clusters and was working to build out our observability stack. I encountered some issues with label joins where Kubernetes metrics didn’t match kube-state-metrics ( KSM ) and started participating in SIG meetings to improve things. I helped test performance improvements to kube-state-metrics and ultimately coauthored a KEP for overhauling metrics in the 1.14 release to improve usability.</description></item><item><title>Blog: Prow and Tide for Kubernetes Contributors</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2022-12-12-blog-prow-and-tide-for-kubernetes-contributors/</link><pubDate>Mon, 12 Dec 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2022-12-12-blog-prow-and-tide-for-kubernetes-contributors/</guid><description>Prow and Tide for Kubernetes Contributors Why is this helpful Back to squashing Assignment, review, approval. More about Prow and Tide More advanced usage Authors: Chris Short , Frederico Muñoz In my work in the Kubernetes world, I look up a label or Prow command often. The systems behind the scenes ( Prow and Tide ) are here to help Kubernetes Contributors get stuff done. Labeling which SIG, WG, or subproject is as important as the issue or PR having someone assigned. To quote the docs , “Tide is a Prow component for managing a pool of GitHub PRs that match a given set of criteria. It will automatically retest PRs that meet the criteria (’tide comes in’) and automatically merge them when they have up-to-date passing test results (’tide goes out’). ” What actually prompted this article is the awesomely amazing folks on the Contributor Comms team saying, “I need to squash my commits and push that. ” Which immediately made me remember the wonder of the Tide label: tide/merge-method-squash. tide/merge-method-squash Contributing to Kubernetes will, most of the time, involve some kind of git-based action, specifically on the Kubernetes GitHub. This can be an obstacle to those less exposed to git and/or GitHub, and is especially noticeable when we’re dealing with non-code contributions (documentation, blog posts, etc. ). git When a contributor submits something, it will generally be through a pull request.</description></item><item><title>Blog: Implementing the Auto-refreshing Official Kubernetes CVE Feed</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2022-09-12-blog-implementing-the-auto-refreshing-official-kubernetes-cve-feed/</link><pubDate>Mon, 12 Sep 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2022-09-12-blog-implementing-the-auto-refreshing-official-kubernetes-cve-feed/</guid><description>Implementing the Auto-refreshing Official Kubernetes CVE Feed Implementation Details Pre-requisites Building on existing tooling Design Considerations Integrity and Access Control Protections Freshness Guarantees What’s Next? Author : Pushkar Joglekar (VMware) Accompanying the release of Kubernetes v1.25, we announced availability of an official CVE feed as an alpha feature. This blog will cover how we implemented this feature. alpha An auto-refreshing CVE feed allows users and implementers to programmatically fetch the list of CVEs announced by the Kubernetes SRC (Security Response Committee). To ensure freshness and minimal maintainer overhead, the feed updates automatically by fetching the CVE related information from the CVE announcement GitHub Issues. Creating these issues is already part of the existing Security Response Committee (SRC) workflow. Until December 2021, it was not possible to filter for issues or PRs that are tied to CVEs announced by Kubernetes SRC. We added a new label, official-cve-feed to address that, and SIG-Security labelled relevant issues with it. The in-scope issues are closed issues for which there is a CVE ID(s) and is officially announced as a Kubernetes security vulnerability by SRC. You can now filter on all of these issues and find them here. official-cve-feed closed For future security vulnerabilities, we added the label to the SRC playbook so that all the future in-scope issues will automatically have this label. For the next step, we created a prow job in order to periodically query the GitHub REST API and pull the relevant issues. The job runs every two hours and pushes the CVE related information fetched from GitHub into a Google Cloud Bucket.</description></item><item><title>Blog: Enhancements Opt-in Process Change for v1.26</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2022-09-09-blog-enhancements-opt-in-process-change-for-v1-26/</link><pubDate>Fri, 09 Sep 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2022-09-09-blog-enhancements-opt-in-process-change-for-v1-26/</guid><description>Enhancements Opt-in Process Change for v1.26 Context and Motivations How does the Github Project Board work? What does this mean for the community? Author: Grace Nguyen Since the inception of the Kubernetes release team, we have used a spreadsheet to keep track of enhancements for the release. The project has scaled massively in the past few years, with almost a hundred enhancements collected for the 1.24 release. This process has become error-prone and time consuming. A lot of manual work is required from the release team and the SIG leads to populate KEPs data in the sheet. We have received continuous feedback from our contributors to streamline the process. Starting with the 1.26 release, we are replacing the enhancements tracking spreadsheet with an automated GitHub project board. The board is populated with a script gathering all KEP issues in the kubernetes/enhancements repo that have the label lead-opted-in. The enhancements’ stage and SIG information will also be automatically pulled from the KEP issue. kubernetes/enhancements lead-opted-in After the KEP is populated on the Github Project Board, the Enhancements team will manually update the KEP with the label tracked/yes , tracked/no and on occasions, tracked/out-of-tree. The tracked label signifies qualification for the closest approaching milestone. For example, at the beginning of the release, tracked/yes means that the KEP has satisfied all Enhancements Freeze requirements and similarly for Code Freeze, tracked/yes means that all code related to the KEP has been merged. The tracked label is reserved for the Enhancements team use only.</description></item><item><title>Blog: Spotlight on SIG Storage</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2022-08-22-blog-spotlight-on-sig-storage/</link><pubDate>Mon, 22 Aug 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2022-08-22-blog-spotlight-on-sig-storage/</guid><description>Spotlight on SIG Storage About SIG Storage Storage and Kubernetes Ongoing challenges Community involvement Since the very beginning of Kubernetes, the topic of persistent data and how to address the requirement of stateful applications has been an important topic. Support for stateless deployments was natural, present from the start, and garnered attention, becoming very well-known. Work on better support for stateful applications was also present from early on, with each release increasing the scope of what could be run on Kubernetes. Message queues, databases, clustered filesystems: these are some examples of the solutions that have different storage requirements and that are, today, increasingly deployed in Kubernetes. Dealing with ephemeral and persistent storage, local or remote, file or block, from many different vendors, while considering how to provide the needed resiliency and data consistency that users expect, all of this is under SIG Storage’s umbrella. In this SIG Storage spotlight, Frederico Muñoz (Cloud &amp;amp; Architecture Lead at SAS) talked with Xing Yang , Tech Lead at VMware and co-chair of SIG Storage, on how the SIG is organized, what are the current challenges and how anyone can get involved and contribute. Frederico (FSM) : Hello, thank you for the opportunity of learning more about SIG Storage. Could you tell us a bit about yourself, your role, and how you got involved in SIG Storage. Xing Yang (XY) : I am a Tech Lead at VMware, working on Cloud Native Storage. I am also a Co-Chair of SIG Storage. I started to get involved in K8s SIG Storage at the end of 2017, starting with contributing to the VolumeSnapshot project. At that time, the VolumeSnapshot project was still in an experimental, pre-alpha stage.</description></item><item><title>Blog: Meet Our Contributors - APAC (China region)</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2022-08-15-blog-meet-our-contributors-apac-china-region/</link><pubDate>Mon, 15 Aug 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2022-08-15-blog-meet-our-contributors-apac-china-region/</guid><description>Meet Our Contributors - APAC (China region) Andy Zhang Shiming Zhang Paco Xu Jintao Zhang Authors &amp;amp; Interviewers: Avinesh Tripathi , Debabrata Panigrahi , Jayesh Srivastava , Priyanka Saggu , Purneswar Prasad , Vedant Kakde Hello, everyone 👋 Welcome back to the third edition of the “Meet Our Contributors” blog post series for APAC. This post features four outstanding contributors from China, who have played diverse leadership and community roles in the upstream Kubernetes project. So, without further ado, let’s get straight to the article. Andy Zhang currently works for Microsoft China at the Shanghai site. His main focus is on Kubernetes storage drivers. Andy started contributing to Kubernetes about 5 years ago. He states that as he is working in Azure Kubernetes Service team and spends most of his time contributing to the Kubernetes community project. Now he is the main contributor of quite a lot Kubernetes subprojects such as Kubernetes cloud provider code. His open source contributions are mainly self-motivated. In the last two years he has mentored a few students contributing to Kubernetes through the LFX Mentorship program, some of whom got jobs due to their expertise and contributions on Kubernetes projects. Andy is an active member of the China Kubernetes community. He adds that the Kubernetes community has a good guide about how to become members, code reviewers, approvers and finally when he found out that some open source projects are in the very early stage, he actively contributed to those projects and became the project maintainer.</description></item><item><title>Blog: Enhancing Kubernetes one KEP at a Time</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2022-08-11-blog-enhancing-kubernetes-one-kep-at-a-time/</link><pubDate>Thu, 11 Aug 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2022-08-11-blog-enhancing-kubernetes-one-kep-at-a-time/</guid><description>Enhancing Kubernetes one KEP at a Time What’s the enhancements subteam? What does the enhancements subteam do? How can I get involved with the release team? How can I find out more? Author: Ryler Hockenbury (Mastercard) Did you know that Kubernetes v1.24 has 46 enhancements ? That’s a lot of new functionality packed into a 4-month release cycle. The Kubernetes release team coordinates the logistics of the release, from remediating test flakes to publishing updated docs. It’s a ton of work, but they always deliver. The release team comprises around 30 people across six subteams - Bug Triage, CI Signal, Enhancements, Release Notes, Communications, and Docs. Each of these subteams manages a component of the release. This post will focus on the role of the enhancements subteam and how you can get involved. Great question. We’ll get to that in a second but first, let’s talk about how features are managed in Kubernetes. Each new feature requires a Kubernetes Enhancement Proposal - KEP for short. KEPs are small structured design documents that provide a way to propose and coordinate new features. The KEP author describes the motivation, design (and alternatives), risks, and tests - then community members provide feedback to build consensus. KEPs are submitted and updated through a pull request (PR) workflow on the k/enhancements repo.</description></item><item><title>Blog: Spotlight on SIG Docs</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2022-08-02-blog-spotlight-on-sig-docs/</link><pubDate>Tue, 02 Aug 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2022-08-02-blog-spotlight-on-sig-docs/</guid><description>Spotlight on SIG Docs Introduction A summary of the conversation Could you tell us a little bit about what SIG Docs does? There are 2 subprojects under Docs: blogs and localization. How has the community benefited from it and are there some interesting contributions by those teams you want to highlight? Recently there has been a lot of buzz around the Kubernetes ecosystem as well as the industry regarding the removal of dockershim in the latest 1.24 release. How has SIG Docs helped the project to ensure a smooth change among the end-users? Why should new and existing contributors consider joining this SIG? How do you help new contributors get started? Are there any prerequisites to join? Any SIG related accomplishment that you’re really proud of? Is there something exciting coming up for the future of SIG Docs that you want the community to know? Wrap Up Author: Purneswar Prasad The official documentation is the go-to source for any open source project. For Kubernetes, it’s an ever-evolving Special Interest Group (SIG) with people constantly putting in their efforts to make details about the project easier to consume for new contributors and users. SIG Docs publishes the official documentation on kubernetes. io which includes, but is not limited to, documentation of the core APIs, core architectural details, and CLI tools shipped with the Kubernetes release. To learn more about the work of SIG Docs and its future ahead in shaping the community, I have summarised my conversation with the co-chairs, Divya Mohan (DM), Rey Lejano (RL) and Natali Vlatko (NV), who ran through the SIG’s goals and how fellow contributors can help. SIG Docs is the special interest group for documentation for the Kubernetes project on kubernetes. io, generating reference guides for the Kubernetes API, kubeadm and kubectl as well as maintaining the official website’s infrastructure and analytics. The remit of their work also extends to docs releases, translation of docs, improvement and adding new features to existing documentation, pushing and reviewing content for the official Kubernetes blog and engaging with the Release Team for each cycle to get docs and blogs reviewed. Blogs : This subproject highlights new or graduated Kubernetes enhancements, community reports, SIG updates or any relevant news to the Kubernetes community such as thought leadership, tutorials and project updates, such as the Dockershim removal and removal of PodSecurityPolicy, which is upcoming in the 1.25 release. Tim Bannister, one of the SIG Docs tech leads, does awesome work and is a major force when pushing contributions through to the docs and blogs.</description></item><item><title>Blog: Contextual Logging in Kubernetes 1.24</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2022-05-25-blog-contextual-logging-in-kubernetes-1-24/</link><pubDate>Wed, 25 May 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2022-05-25-blog-contextual-logging-in-kubernetes-1-24/</guid><description>Contextual Logging in Kubernetes 1.24 Structured logging Contextual logging klog enhancements Contextual logging API ktesting logger klogr Reusable output test Output flushing Various other changes logcheck Next steps Authors: Patrick Ohly (Intel) The Structured Logging Working Group has added new capabilities to the logging infrastructure in Kubernetes 1.24. This blog post explains how developers can take advantage of those to make log output more useful and how they can get involved with improving Kubernetes. The goal of structured logging is to replace C-style formatting and the resulting opaque log strings with log entries that have a well-defined syntax for storing message and parameters separately, for example as a JSON struct. When using the traditional klog text output format for structured log calls, strings were originally printed with \n escape sequences, except when embedded inside a struct. For structs, log entries could still span multiple lines, with no clean way to split the log stream into individual entries: \n I1112 14:06:35.783529 328441 structured_logging. go:51] &amp;ldquo;using InfoS&amp;rdquo; longData={Name:long Data:Multiple lines with quite a bit of text. internal:0} I1112 14:06:35.783549 328441 structured_logging. go:52] &amp;ldquo;using InfoS with\nthe message across multiple lines&amp;rdquo; int=1 stringData=&amp;ldquo;long: Multiple\nlines\nwith quite a bit\nof text. &amp;quot; str=&amp;ldquo;another value&amp;rdquo; I1112 14:06:35.783529 328441 structured_logging. go:51] &amp;ldquo;using InfoS&amp;rdquo; longData={Name:long Data:Multiple lines with quite a bit of text. internal:0} I1112 14:06:35.783549 328441 structured_logging. go:52] &amp;ldquo;using InfoS with\nthe message across multiple lines&amp;rdquo; int=1 stringData=&amp;ldquo;long: Multiple\nlines\nwith quite a bit\nof text.</description></item><item><title>Blog: February 2022 Community Meeting Highlights</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2022-05-05-blog-february-2022-community-meeting-highlights/</link><pubDate>Thu, 05 May 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2022-05-05-blog-february-2022-community-meeting-highlights/</guid><description>February 2022 Community Meeting Highlights Author: Nigel Brown (VMware) We just had our first contributor community meeting this year, and it was awesome to be back with you in that format. These meetings will be happening on Zoom once per month, on the third Thursday of the month - that should be available in your calendar if you’re subscribed to the k-dev mailing list. Community meetings are an opportunity for you to meet synchronously with other members of the Kubernetes community to talk about issues of general appeal. This meeting kicked off with an update on the 1.24 release with Xander Grzywinski, who is one of the shadows for the release team leads. This release is scheduled for April 19, 2022 with a code freeze scheduled for March 30th. At the time of the meeting there were 66 individual enhancements included, as well as bug fixes. You can join the conversation on Slack in #sig-release. Update: Kubernetes 1.24 was delayed and released on May 3, 2022. From there, the discussion moved to the dockershim removal and the docs updates we need to make around that, with the discussion led by Kat Cosgrove. The main takeaway was that if you have a platform, talk to folks about this change. To most interacting with Kubernetes, it is probably not as impactful as it sounds. We have a helpful FAQ if you need.</description></item><item><title>Blog: K8s CI Bot Helper Job: automating "make update"</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2022-03-15-blog-k8s-ci-bot-helper-job-automating-make-update/</link><pubDate>Tue, 15 Mar 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2022-03-15-blog-k8s-ci-bot-helper-job-automating-make-update/</guid><description>K8s CI Bot Helper Job: automating &amp;ldquo;make update&amp;rdquo; Why is this needed? Potential Workaround Possible solutions to counter the above errors The current situation Solutions Implementing the Short Term Workaround Conclusion Authors: Subhasmita Swain , Davanum Srinivas If you are contributing to the Kubernetes project and are developing on a Windows PC, it is conceivable that you will encounter certain issues that will cause your pull request to get held up by test failures. This article describes a workaround for a similar issue I encountered when attempting to have my modifications approved and merged into the master branch. While contributing to kubernetes/kubernetes for some minor documentation changes, the pushed changes needed to be updated with other verified contents of the entire documentation. So, in order for the change to take effect, a single command must be performed to ensure that all tests on the CI pipeline pass. The single command make update runs all presubmission verification tests. For some reason on the “Windows Subsystem for Linux” environment the tests, specifically the update-openapi-spec. sh script, failed (in my case, take a look at the conversation here ), eventually failing the pull-kubernetes-verify tests. make update pull-kubernetes-verify You might encounter the following on your PR The tests failing the particular issue: Consecutively, Additionally one can check the failed test via the link provided under details in the above image. link Run the failing. sh scripts individually known from the CI job output, to generate the expected files to fix up the failures.

This post will feature four outstanding contributors from the Australia and New Zealand regions, who have played diverse leadership and community roles in the Upstream Kubernetes project. So, without further ado, let’s get straight to the article. Caleb Woodbine is currently a member of the ii. nz organisation. He began contributing to the Kubernetes project in 2018 as a member of the Kubernetes Conformance working group. His experience was positive, and he benefited from early guidance from Hippie Hacker , a fellow contributor from New Zealand. He has made major contributions to Kubernetes project since then through SIG k8s-infra and k8s-conformance working group. SIG k8s-infra k8s-conformance Caleb is also a co-organizer of the CloudNative NZ community events, which aim to expand the reach of Kubernetes project throughout New Zealand in order to encourage technical education and improved employment opportunities. There need to be more outreach in APAC and the educators and universities must pick up Kubernetes, as they are very slow and about 8+ years out of date. NZ tends to rather pay overseas than educate locals on the latest cloud tech Locally.

There are frequent releases of Kubernetes, base operating systems, container runtimes, and test infrastructure that result in a complex matrix that requires attention and steady investment to “keep the lights on. ” In May 2020, the Kubernetes node special interest group (“SIG Node”) organized a new subproject for continuous integration (CI) for node-related code and tests. Since its inauguration, the SIG Node CI subproject has run a weekly meeting, and even the full hour is often not enough to complete triage of all bugs, test-related PRs and issues, and discuss all related ongoing work within the subgroup. Over the past two years, we’ve fixed merge-blocking and release-blocking tests, reducing time to merge Kubernetes contributors’ pull requests thanks to reduced test flakes. When we started, Node test jobs only passed 42% of the time, and through our efforts, we now ensure a consistent &amp;gt;90% job pass rate. We’ve closed 144 test failure issues and merged 176 pull requests just in kubernetes/kubernetes. And we’ve helped subproject participants ascend the Kubernetes contributor ladder, with 3 new org members, 6 new reviewers, and 2 new approvers. The Node CI subproject is an approachable first stop to help new contributors get started with SIG Node. There is a low barrier to entry for new contributors to address high-impact bugs and test fixes, although there is a long road before contributors can climb the entire contributor ladder: it took over a year to establish two new approvers for the group. The complexity of all the different components that power Kubernetes nodes and its test infrastructure requires a sustained investment over a long period for developers to deeply understand the entire system, both at high and low levels of detail. We have several regular contributors at our meetings, however; our reviewers and approvers pool is still small.</description></item><item><title>Blog: Spotlight on SIG Multicluster</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2022-02-04-blog-spotlight-on-sig-multicluster/</link><pubDate>Fri, 04 Feb 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2022-02-04-blog-spotlight-on-sig-multicluster/</guid><description>Spotlight on SIG Multicluster Introduction A summary of their conversation Wrap up Authors: Dewan Ahmed (Aiven) and Chris Short (AWS) SIG Multicluster is the Special Interest Group (SIG) focused on how Kubernetes concepts are expanded and used beyond the cluster boundary. Historically, Kubernetes resources only interacted within that boundary - KRU or Kubernetes Resource Universe (not an actual Kubernetes concept). Kubernetes clusters, even now, don’t really know anything about themselves or, about other clusters. Absence of cluster identifiers is a case in point. With the growing adoption of multicloud and multicluster deployments, the work SIG Multicluster doing is gaining a lot of attention. In this article, Jeremy Olmsted-Thompson, Google and Chris Short, AWS discuss the interesting problems SIG Multicluster is solving and how you can get involved. Their initials JOT and CS will be used for brevity. CS : How long has the SIG Multicluster existed and how was the SIG in its infancy? How long have you been with this SIG? JOT : I’ve been around for almost two years in the SIG Multicluster. All I know about the infancy years is from the lore but even in the early days, it was always about solving this same problem. Early efforts have been things like KubeFed. I think there are still folks using KubeFed but it’s a smaller slice. Back then, I think people out there deploying large numbers of Kubernetes clusters were really not at a point where we had a ton of real concrete use cases.</description></item><item><title>Blog: Meet Our Contributors - APAC (India region)</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2022-01-10-blog-meet-our-contributors-apac-india-region/</link><pubDate>Mon, 10 Jan 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2022-01-10-blog-meet-our-contributors-apac-india-region/</guid><description>Meet Our Contributors - APAC (India region) Arsh Sharma Kunal Kushwaha Madhav Jivarajani Rajas Kakodkar Rajula Vineeth Reddy Authors &amp;amp; Interviewers: Anubhav Vardhan , Atharva Shinde , Avinesh Tripathi , Debabrata Panigrahi , Kunal Verma , Pranshu Srivastava , Pritish Samal , Purneswar Prasad , Vedant Kakde Editor: Priyanka Saggu Good day, everyone 👋 Welcome to the first episode of the APAC edition of the “Meet Our Contributors” blog post series. In this post, we’ll introduce you to five amazing folks from the India region who have been actively contributing to the upstream Kubernetes projects in a variety of ways, as well as being the leaders or maintainers of numerous community initiatives. 💫 Let’s get started, so without further ado… Arsh is currently employed with Okteto as a Developer Experience engineer. As a new contributor, he realised that 1:1 mentorship opportunities were quite beneficial in getting him started with the upstream project. He is presently a CI Signal shadow on the Kubernetes 1.23 release team. He is also contributing to the SIG Testing and SIG Docs projects, as well as to the cert-manager tools development work that is being done under the aegis of SIG Architecture. To the newcomers, Arsh helps plan their early contributions sustainably. I would encourage folks to contribute in a way that’s sustainable. What I mean by that is that it’s easy to be very enthusiastic early on and take up more stuff than one can actually handle. This can often lead to burnout in later stages. It’s much more sustainable to work on things iteratively. Kunal Kushwaha is a core member of the Kubernetes marketing council.</description></item><item><title>Blog: Announcing the Kubernetes Contributor Celebration 2021</title><link>https://kubermates.org/docs/2021-12-07-blog-announcing-the-kubernetes-contributor-celebration-2021/</link><pubDate>Tue, 07 Dec 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubermates.org/docs/2021-12-07-blog-announcing-the-kubernetes-contributor-celebration-2021/</guid><description>Announcing the Kubernetes Contributor Celebration 2021 Contributor Celebration 2021 Registration Events and Activities Schedule See you all at the event By Debabrata Panigrahi It’s that time of the year again, Yayy!!
